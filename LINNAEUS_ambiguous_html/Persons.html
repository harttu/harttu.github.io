Abstract
Background
The link between poverty and health is central to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Poverty can be both a cause and consequence of poor health, but there are few epidemiological studies exploring this complex relationship. The aim of this study was to examine the association between visual impairment from cataract and poverty in adults in Kenya, Bangladesh, and the Philippines.<br><br>Methods and Findings
A population-based case–control study was conducted in three countries during 2005–2006. Cases were <span class="yellow">persons</span> aged 50 y or older and visually impaired due to cataract (visual acuity < 6/24 in the better eye). Controls were <span class="yellow">persons</span> age- and sex-matched to the case <span class="yellow">participants</span> with normal vision selected from the same cluster. Household expenditure was assessed through the collection of detailed consumption data, and asset ownership and self-rated wealth were also measured. In total, 596 cases and 535 controls were included in these analyses (Kenya 142 cases, 75 controls; Bangladesh 216 cases, 279 controls; Philippines 238 cases, 180 controls). Case <span class="yellow">participants</span> were more likely to be in the lowest quartile of per capita expenditure (PCE) compared to controls in Kenya (odds ratio = 2.3, 95% confidence interval 0.9–5.5), Bangladesh (1.9, 1.1–3.2), and the Philippines (3.1, 1.7–5.7), and there was significant dose–response relationship across quartiles of PCE. These associations persisted after adjustment for self-rated health and social support indicators. A similar pattern was observed for the relationship between cataract visual impairment with asset ownership and self-rated wealth. There was no consistent pattern of association between PCE and level of visual impairment due to cataract, sex, or age among the three countries.<br><br>Conclusions
Our data show that <span class="yellow">people</span> with visual impairment due to cataract were poorer than those with normal sight in all three low-income countries studied. The MDGs are committed to the eradication of extreme poverty and provision of health care to poor <span class="yellow">people</span>, and this study highlights the need for increased provision of cataract surgery to poor <span class="yellow">people</span>, as they are particularly vulnerable to visual impairment from cataract.<br><br>Background.
Globally, about 45 million <span class="yellow">people</span> are blind. As with many other conditions, avoidable blindness (preventable or curable blindness) is a particular problem for <span class="yellow">people</span> in developing countries—90% of blind <span class="yellow">people</span> live in poor regions of the world. Although various infections and disorders can cause blindness, cataract is the most common cause. In cataract, which is responsible for half of all cases of blindness in the world, the lens of the eye gradually becomes cloudy. Because the lens focuses light to produce clear, sharp images, as cataract develops, vision becomes increasingly foggy or fuzzy, colors become less intense, and the ability to see shapes against a background declines. Eventually, vision may be lost completely. Cataract can be treated with an inexpensive, simple operation in which the cloudy lens is surgically removed and an artificial lens is inserted into the eye to restore vision. In developed countries, this operation is common and easily accessible but many poor countries lack the resources to provide the operation to everyone who needs it. In addition, blind <span class="yellow">people</span> often cannot afford to travel to the hospitals where the operation, which also may come with a fee, is done.<br><br>Why Was This Study Done?
Because blindness may reduce earning potential, many experts believe that poverty and blindness (and, more generally, poor health) are inextricably linked. <span class="yellow">People</span> become ill more often in poor countries than in wealthy countries because they have insufficient food, live in substandard housing, and have limited access to health care, education, water, and sanitation. Once they are ill, their ability to earn money may be reduced, which increases their personal poverty and slows the economic development of the whole country. Because of this potential link between health and poverty, improvements in health are at the heart of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, a set of eight goals established in 2000 with the primary aim of reducing world poverty. However, few studies have actually investigated the complex relationship between poverty and health. Here, the researchers investigate the association between visual impairment from cataract and poverty among adults living in three low-income countries.<br><br>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
The researchers identified nearly 600 <span class="yellow">people</span> aged 50 y or more with severe cataract-induced visual impairment (“cases”) primarily through a survey of the population in Kenya, Bangladesh, and the Philippines. They matched each case to a normally sighted (“control”) <span class="yellow">person</span> of similar age and sex living nearby. They then assessed a proxy for the income level, measured as “per capita expenditure” (PCE), of all the study <span class="yellow">participants</span> (<span class="yellow">people</span> with cataracts and controls) by collecting information about what their households consumed. The <span class="yellow">participants</span>' housing conditions and other assets and their self-rated wealth were also measured. In all three countries, cases were more likely to be in the lowest quarter (quartile) of the range of PCEs for that country than controls. In the Philippines, for example, <span class="yellow">people</span> with cataract-affected vision were three times more likely than normally sighted controls to have a PCE in the lowest quartile than in the highest quartile. The risk of cataract-related visual impairment increased as PCE decreased in all three countries. Similarly, severe cataract-induced visual impairment was more common in those who owned fewer assets and those with lower self-rated wealth. However, there was no consistent association between PCE and the level of cataract-induced visual impairment.<br><br>What Do These Findings Mean?
These findings show that there is an association between visual impairment caused by cataract and poverty in Kenya, Bangladesh, and the Philippines. However, because the financial circumstances of the <span class="yellow">people</span> in this study were assessed after cataracts had impaired their sight, this study does not prove that poverty is a cause of visual impairment. A causal connection between poverty and cataract can only be shown by determining the PCEs of normally sighted <span class="yellow">people</span> and following them for several years to see who develops cataract. Nevertheless, by confirming an association between poverty and blindness, these findings highlight the need for increased provision of cataract surgery to poor <span class="yellow">people</span>, particularly since cataract surgery has the potential to improve the quality of life for many <span class="yellow">people</span> in developing countries at a relatively low cost.<br><br>Additional Information.

Improvements in health are at the heart of the Millennium Development Goals, with the recognition that better health is central to the primary aim of reducing poverty as well as important in its own right. Empirical data are needed to back up this claim. Unravelling the relationship between blindness and poverty therefore has important implications, and may also be informative for the association between poverty and other disabilities.
Blindness is a common condition globally, affecting approximately 45 million <span class="yellow">people</span>, and more than a third of blindness is caused by cataract [1,2]. Globally, the prevalence of blindness is five-fold higher in poor than rich countries [2]. Limited data show that within countries the poor are also more likely to be blind [3,4]. It is frequently asserted that blindness is both a cause and consequence of poverty, but there are few empirical data to support this claim. Poverty may cause cataract blindness, because access to cataract surgery is limited in low-income countries [5]. Furthermore, within poor countries some evidence suggests that lack of money is a major barrier to uptake of cataract surgery by individuals [6–8]. Blindness may also cause poverty, as the blind individual, or the household members who care for them, have a reduced earning potential [4,9]. This complex problem could have serious implications; estimates from The Gambia suggest that there is a substantial economic burden from lost productivity among blind <span class="yellow">people</span> [10]. Therefore, blindness prevention may ultimately be cost saving [11]. Extrapolations on a global level indicate that a successful eye care programme could prevent more than 100 million cases of blindness between 2000 and 2020, and consequently save at least US$102 billion, which would otherwise be lost to reductions in productivity associated with blindness [12]. However, these estimates are based on extrapolations from limited data and were not based on individual-level data. It is also difficult to identify the component of productivity loss that is due to blindness, as this condition mainly affects older <span class="yellow">people</span>, who may suffer from other comorbidities that restrict their employment opportunities or make them dependent on the care of others.
The Cataract Impact Study was undertaken to assess the relationship between cataract visual impairment and “economic poverty” and quality of life, and to estimate the impact of cataract surgery on these factors in three low-income countries. The aim of the current paper is to assess the association at baseline between visual impairment from cataract and household poverty (measured through consumption, asset ownership, and self-rated wealth) in a population-based case–control study in Kenya, the Philippines, and Bangladesh.<br><br>Methods
Setting
Case and control <span class="yellow">participants</span> were recruited from Nakuru district, Kenya (January–February, 2005); Negros island (May–June, 2005) and Antique district (April–May, 2006), Philippines; and Satkhira district, Bangladesh (November–December, 2005).<br><br>Selection of Cases and Controls
<span class="blue">Persons</span> with cataract visual impairment (cases) and <span class="yellow">persons</span> without (controls) were primarily recruited through a population-based survey of adults aged ≥ 50 y [6–8]. Clusters of 50 <span class="yellow">people</span> (regardless of visual impairment) aged ≥ 50 y were selected through probability-proportionate to size sampling, using either the census (Philippines and Bangladesh) or electoral role (Kenya) as the sampling frame. Households within clusters were selected through a modification of compact segment sampling, whereby a map was drawn of the enumeration area that was divided into segments, each including approximately 50 <span class="yellow">people</span> aged ≥ 50 y, and one segment was chosen at random [13]. Households in the segment were included sequentially until 50 <span class="yellow">people</span> aged ≥ 50 y were identified. The surveys included 3,503 (93% response rate) <span class="yellow">people</span> aged ≥ 50 y in Kenya, 4,868 (92%) in Bangladesh, 2,774 (76%) in Negros, and 3,177 (83%) in Antique.
All <span class="yellow">people</span> in the survey aged ≥ 50 y underwent visual acuity (VA) testing and ophthalmic examination. VA was measured in full daylight with available spectacle correction with a Snellen tumbling “E” chart using optotype size 6/18 (20/60) on one side and size 6/60 (20/200) on the other side at 6 or 3 metres. If the VA was <6/18 in either eye then pinhole vision was also measured. <span class="yellow">Participants</span> with pinhole vision <6/18 but >6/60 in the better eye due to age-related cataract were given a second VA test using an “E” of size 6/24. The ophthalmologist examined all eyes with a presenting VA <6/18 with a torch (i.e., flashlight), direct ophthalmoscope, and/or portable slit lamp. The principal cause of blindness or visual impairment was recorded, according to the WHO convention in which the major cause is assigned to the primary disorder or, if there are two existing primary disorders, to the one that is easiest to treat [14].
Survey <span class="yellow">participants</span> were eligible for inclusion as cases if they were aged ≥ 50 y with best corrected visual acuity <6/24 in the better eye due to cataract, as diagnosed by an ophthalmologist. All eligible cases identified from these surveys were invited to participate in the study. <span class="yellow">Participants</span> were eligible to be controls if they were aged ≥ 50 y, did not have VA <6/24 in the better eye due to cataract and did not live in the same household as a case. During the survey a list was maintained of all eligible controls, by age group (50–54, 55–59, 60–64, 65–69, and >70) and sex. Whenever a case was identified, one age- and sex-matched control was randomly selected from the list for inclusion (or up to two controls in Bangladesh). If no matching eligible controls had been identified in that cluster at that stage of the survey, then the next eligible control in the cluster was recruited.
Because of logistical and time constraints, additional cases were also included through community-based case detection. In Kenya and Negros (Philippines), clusters were randomly selected through probability proportionate to size using the same cluster sampling procedure after completion of the population-based survey. Clusters were visited in advance and asked that all <span class="yellow">people</span> ≥ 50 y with vision problems come to a central point on a specified day, and that a list be made of <span class="yellow">people</span> unable to attend (e.g., due to blindness or other physical disability). After examining <span class="yellow">patients</span> at the central point, the survey team then visited those unable to leave their houses. Any identified eligible cases that agreed to be part of the study were interviewed in their homes. In Bangladesh and Antique (Philippines), community case detection was carried out simultaneously with the survey by two of the four teams, so that controls were included for these cases. Within each cluster from the survey, one interviewer was asked to be taken to two community members aged ≥ 50 y with eye problems, living within the cluster boundaries but not from the segments selected for the survey. If VA was <6/24 with pinhole in the better eye, the ophthalmologist was called to carry out the full eye examination, and eligible cases were included in the study.
For the purposes of the present analyses, control individuals with any visual impairment (VA <6/18 in the better eye) were excluded (n = 14 in Kenya, n = 53 in Bangladesh, n = 24 in the Philippines). Case and control <span class="yellow">participants</span> who were significantly communication impaired (e.g. deafness, dementia, or psychiatric disease) were excluded (fewer than five per country), and one case was excluded in the Philippines because of missing age data. One household had two eligible cases (Kenya), and one of these <span class="yellow">participants</span> was excluded for the poverty analyses as poverty was assessed through household level indicators (see below).
In total, 147 cases (82 from the survey and 65 from case detection) and 79 controls were included in Kenya; 217 cases (162 from survey and 55 from case detection) and 280 controls in Bangladesh; and 238 cases (146 survey and 92 case detection) and 180 controls in the Philippines.<br><br>Data Collection
All case and control <span class="yellow">participants</span> were interviewed in their homes by trained interviewers in the local language. Each interview lasted approximately 1 h.
Measures of poverty.
Poverty was measured through (a) monthly per capita expenditure (PCE) to indicate consumption, (b) asset ownership, and (c) self-rated wealth. The economic part of the questionnaires was adapted through interviews, focus group discussions, and pilot testing in each country to ensure local relevance.
The <span class="yellow">person</span> primarily responsible for household finances (which may have been the case/control or another household member) was interviewed to assess PCE and assets. PCE was measured using methods based on the World Bank's Living Standards Measurement Study [15]. Items were included on food (42–52 items per country), education (three items), health (five items), household expenses (nine items), and personal expenses (21 or 22 items). In total, 85 items were included in the questionnaire in Kenya, 90 in the Philippines, and 79 in Bangladesh. The informant was asked to recall the monetary value of food that was purchased, consumed from home production, or received as payment in kind or as gifts. Consumption was assessed over a 1-wk period for frequently consumed items, and this was scaled up to estimate monthly consumption. The amount consumed monthly was assessed for items that were consumed more rarely. Monthly rent was recorded among households who rented, and households who owned their property were asked to estimate the amount that they could charge in rent per month. The consumption on all items was summed to calculate total monthly household consumption, and this was converted to United States dollars (US$) at the 2005 exchange rate ($1 = 76 Kenya shillings, 64 Bangladesh taka, 55 Philippine pesos). Total monthly household consumption was divided by the number of household members to calculate monthly PCE for the household.
The household informant was also asked about the number and type of context-specific assets owned by the household, including different types of furniture, electrical equipment, <span class="yellow">cattle</span>, and vehicles. Information was collected on household characteristics, including the building material of the floor, roof, and walls; type of toilet; and the number of rooms.
Self-rated wealth was assessed by asking the household informant to rank the household's wealth relative to others in the community on a scale from 1 (poorest) to 10 (richest).<br><br>Covariates.
Case and control individuals were interviewed about standard sociodemographic indicators, including household composition, education, and employment. Information was collected on vision-related quality of life using the World Health Organization Prevention of Blindness and Deafness 20-item Visual Functioning Questionnaire [16,17], and health-related quality of life was assessed using items from the European Quality of Life Questionnaire [18]. Detailed time-use data were collected using methods based on the World Bank's Living Standards Measurement Study [15].<br><br>
Training and Fieldwork
Interviewers were trained for 1 wk, including 2 d of pilot testing. Attempts were made to minimise measurement bias by emphasising the need for consistency in data collection among cases and controls. The questionnaires were translated into the local languages (three in Kenya, three in the Philippines, and one in Bangladesh) and back-translated by independent translators (one for each language) who were also asked to comment on appropriateness of language used for the target population. A review was held to discuss differences in translation and modify accordingly. The questionnaire was piloted in each setting and small modifications to wording of some items were made, where appropriate, to ensure local understanding. Teams were accompanied by a field supervisor at least 1 d per wk to ensure that high quality was maintained and interviews were observed randomly throughout the study.<br><br>Statistical Analysis
Microsoft Access was used for data entry, and all data were double entered and validated. Analyses were undertaken in SAS version 8.2.
The mean and range of each expenditure item was calculated to assess whether answers were plausible, and to identify and exclude gross outliers (none identified). Rental equivalents were imputed based on household characteristics and non-rent expenditure for households where these estimates were missing or unreasonably low (< $1 per mo) (four in Kenya, three in Bangladesh, 18 in the Philippines). Total monthly household consumption was divided by the number of household members to calculate per capita household expenditure. Per capita household expenditure was divided into quartiles, separately for each country, based on the distribution of the data for the case and control <span class="yellow">participants</span> combined. Households with incomplete expenditure data were excluded from analyses (five cases and four controls in Kenya; one case and one control in Bangladesh).
A relative index of household assets was derived using principal components analysis (PCA) to determine weights for a list of assets and wealth indicators [19]. Variables entered into the PCA included building materials of the house, ownership of ten household assets, animal ownership, and education of the head of the household. The derived index was divided into quartiles from poorest (lowest socioeconomic status [SES] index) to least poor (highest SES index). PCA analyses were undertaken separately for each country. The means of the poverty variables were first compared for cases recruited through the two different methods, and then from cases and controls using t-tests for continuous variables (e.g., PCE and assets). For categorical variables (e.g., household rank) we used the Mann-Whitney test and presented medians and interquartile ranges. PCE was highly skewed and therefore was log transformed for the t-tests. The two-way correlations were calculated between PCE, assets, and household rank, in turn.
Logistic regression analyses were undertaken separately for each country, assessing the association between case/control status and sociodemographic and poverty variables. Conditional logistic regression was not undertaken, since the matching was incomplete, so all analyses were adjusted for the matching variables (age, sex, and rural/urban location). Likelihood ratio tests were undertaken to assess the significance of adding covariates with more than two levels (e.g., age groups, self-rated health groups) to the model. Tests for trend were undertaken across quartiles of the poverty variables and assessed using the p-value for trend. Analyses were also conducted adjusting for the logistic regression analyses for poverty by social support indicators (marital status and household size) and self-rated health, since these variables may confound the association between cataract visual impairment and poverty. Analyses from the Philippines were also adjusted for study site, since data were obtained from two settings (Negros and Antique). An attempt was made to disentangle the relationship between poverty and cataract by stratifying the analyses by age, sex, and level of visual impairment among the cases.<br><br>Ethical Approval
Informed signed or thumb-printed consent was obtained from all cases and controls. In Kenya and Bangladesh all cases were offered free cataract surgery at the local hospital, with free transport. In the Philippines, <span class="yellow">patients</span> were referred for surgery, which was subsidised for <span class="yellow">patients</span> who could not afford the fee. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the ethics committees of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, the Kenya Medical Research Institute, the Bangladesh Medical Research Council, and the University of St. La Salle, Bacolod, Philippines. This study complied with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.<br><br>
Results
Sociodemographic Characteristics of Cases and Controls
Case and control <span class="yellow">participants</span> were matched reasonably closely by sex and location. However, within the age category ≥ 70 y, cases tended to be older than the controls, so that cases were over-represented in the oldest age groups (75–79 and ≥ 80 y) compared to controls (Table 1). Cases were less likely to be married than controls, in Kenya (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.3–1.1), Bangladesh (0.6, 0.4–1.0), and the Philippines (0.7, 0.4–1.0), although this only reached statistical significance in Bangladesh (p = 0.03). There was a strong protective effect of literacy and education on cataract in Bangladesh and Kenya that was not evident in the Philippines. Cases were substantially less likely to have a job other than working in the field compared to controls in all three countries. Cases reported significantly poorer self-rated health than controls—this pattern was particularly evident in the Philippines (OR for lowest versus highest quartile of self-rated health = 5.7, 95% CI 3.0–10.7) but also apparent in Kenya (2.6, 1.1–6.2) and Bangladesh (3.3, 2.1–5.3).<br><br>Summary Wealth Measures
All three settings were poor. The mean PCE was less than US$1 per <span class="yellow">person</span> per day in all three settings: US$26.4 (standard deviation [SD] = US$34.9) in Kenya, US$21.7 (US$48.0) in Bangladesh and US$26.1 (US$23.5) in the Philippines. The biggest expense was food in all three settings, making up 55% of PCE in Kenya, 47% in Bangladesh, and 64% in the Philippines, followed by household expenses including rent (21% in Kenya, 28% Bangladesh, and 22% Philippines) (Figure 1). The majority of food consumption was from direct purchase (70% in Kenya, 75% in Bangladesh, and 77% in the Philippines) or home-grown production (24% in Kenya, 22% in Bangladesh, and 17% in the Philippines), and little was from gifts or payments.
An asset score was created through PCA in the three settings. The first principal component explained 22% of the variability in asset variables in Kenya, 25% in Bangladesh, and 24% in the Philippines. Self-perceived wealth of the household clustered around the average with a large proportion of households in Kenya (48%), Bangladesh (43%), and the Philippines (64%); households stating that they were ranked between 4 and 6, on a scale from 1 to 10, in terms of wealth in their community. The three measures of poverty were highly correlated, each showing significant correlation (p < 0.001) with the other measure.<br><br>Economic and Household Characteristics of Cases and Controls
There were no significant differences in PCE, assets, or household rank between cases recruited through the population-based survey and those recruited through case detection, with the exception that the case-detection cases had lower household rank in Kenya (mean = 3.7 versus 3.1, p = 0.02). Consequently, cases recruited through the two methods were combined in the subsequent analyses.
Cases were poorer than controls, in all three settings according to all three poverty measurements (Table 2). The mean PCE was 20%–28% lower for members of households with a case than for control households, and this difference was highly significant in Bangladesh and the Philippines; for Kenya it was lower but did not reach significance (p = 0.07). The PCA score for assets was significantly lower among cases than controls in Kenya and Bangladesh, and it was lower in the Philippines although it did not reach significance (p = 0.06). Self-perceived wealth was significantly lower for households with a case compared to control households in Kenya (3.4 versus 4.5) and Bangladesh (3.9 versus 4.6), though not in the Philippines (4.1 versus 4.3).
There was no difference in the size of the households of cases and controls in any of the three settings. The ratio of dependents (i.e., household member aged <15 or ≥ 50 y) to independents (i.e., household member aged 15–50 y) was similar between cases and controls in Bangladesh (1.4 versus 1.4), but the dependency ratio was higher for controls than cases in Kenya (2.1 versus 1.6) and the Philippines (1.7 versus 1.3), due to the smaller number of <span class="yellow">people</span> of working age.<br><br>Patterns of Expenditure in Cases and Controls
Figure 1 shows the total PCE and the allocation of expenditure within quartiles of PCE for cases and controls. Monthly PCE was similar for cases and controls within each of the quartiles of expenditure. There was a gradual increase in PCE between the first three quartiles, and then a rapid increase between the third and the richest quartile. Within the first three quartiles of PCE the majority of expenditure was on food. Substantial expenditure on non-food items was observed only in the highest quartile of expenditure, where about half of expenditure was on non-food items. Similar patterns of PCE were observed for cases and controls in Kenya, Bangladesh, and the Philippines within each quartile of expenditure. These results demonstrate that cataract visual impairment was related to reduced PCE, but not allocation of expenditure.<br><br>Multivariate Analyses of Poverty and Cataract Visual Impairment
Multivariate analyses showed that case <span class="yellow">participants</span> were consistently poorer than controls in Kenya, Bangladesh, and the Philippines, using three different measures of poverty (Table 3). Cases were more likely than controls to be in the lowest quartile of PCE rather than the highest quartile in Kenya (OR 2.3, 95% CI 0.9–5.5), Bangladesh (1.9, 1.1–3.2) and the Philippines (3.1, 1.7–5.7). In all three settings these associations showed significant dose–response as assessed by the p-value for trend across the quartiles, with decreasing PCE related to case status and these relationships persisted after adjustment for self-rated health and social support indicators. A similar pattern was observed for the relationship between case–control status and asset ownership. Cases were significantly more likely to be in the lowest quartile of asset ownership rather than the highest quartile compared to controls in Kenya (3.7, 1.4–9.6), Bangladesh (2.6, 1.5–4.4), and the Philippines (2.1, 1.1–3.8). Cases were also significantly more likely to be in the lowest quartile of household rank rather than the highest, compared to controls in Kenya (3.5, 1.5–8.0), Bangladesh (2.7, 1.6–4.7) and the Philippines (2.3, 1.1–4.8). The associations with assets and household rank also showed a significant dose–response relationship, and the associations were largely unchanged after adjustment for self-rated health and social support indicators. In Kenya and Bangladesh the relationship between PCE and case status was somewhat weaker than for the other measures of poverty, while the reverse was true in the Philippines.
Stratifying the association between PCE and cataract visual impairment by level of visual impairment showed an inconsistent pattern (Table 4). In Kenya, the association with low PCE was somewhat stronger comparing cataract blind cases to controls (OR 3.1, 95% CI 0.9–10.8) than comparing moderate visually impaired cases to controls (1.8, 0.6–5.4), while this pattern was reversed in Bangladesh (blind cases versus controls: 1.8, 1.0–3.4; moderately visually impaired cases versus controls: 3.1, 1.3–7.2). In the Philippines the association with low PCE was strongest comparing severely visually impaired cases to controls (5.9, 2.0–17.6). The association between cataract visual impairment and PCE was stronger among <span class="yellow">men</span> than <span class="yellow">women</span> in Bangladesh and the Philippines, while the reverse was true in Kenya (Table 5). In Kenya and the Philippines the strongest association between cataract and PCE was among <span class="yellow">people</span> aged 70–79 y, while in Bangladesh the strongest effect was in <span class="yellow">people</span> aged over 80 y. Stratifying the association between assets and household rank with cataract by level of visual impairment, sex, or age broadly repeated these findings, and generally supported the lack of consistent pattern (unpublished data).<br><br>
Discussion
This large, multicentre population-based case–control study provides evidence that <span class="yellow">people</span> with visual impairment from cataract are poorer than control <span class="yellow">participants</span> with normal vision matched for age and sex. This pattern was evident whether poverty was measured in terms of PCE, assets, or self-rated wealth. Marital status seemed to be protective for cataract visual impairment, possibly indicating the role of social support in health-seeking behaviour. Reduced self-rated health was also strongly related to cataract visual impairment. This demonstrates the impact of poor vision on overall assessments of health and supports our previous finding of a relationship between cataract and quality of life [17].
Adjustment for marital status and self-rated health did not entirely explain the association between poverty and cataract visual impairment, suggesting that it operated through other pathways. Visual impairment could cause poverty through reduced employment opportunities. We might therefore expect to see a stronger relationship between cataract and poverty among the blind case <span class="yellow">participants</span> who may have fewer employment opportunities than among those less impaired (i.e., moderate visual impairment). Poverty may also cause visual impairment through restricted access to cataract surgery. In this case we would expect to see a stronger relationship between poverty and less severely affected cases (i.e., moderate visual impairment), as poor families may allocate money for surgery on members who are blind from cataract, so that poverty mainly restricts access to surgery among <span class="yellow">people</span> who are moderately visually impaired. The relationships that we observed between level of visual impairment and cataract were inconsistent across the three settings. Perhaps this shows that both pathways were operating or that the dynamics of the relationship between poverty and blindness vary in different settings. Levels of literacy and education were lower among cases than controls. These long-term indicators of disadvantage are unlikely to have changed after the onset of cataract. This observation provides some evidence that poverty preceded blindness in our study <span class="yellow">participants</span>.
It is frequently asserted that blindness is both a cause and consequence of poverty, but there are few empirical data to support this claim. Globally, the prevalence of blindness is five-fold higher in poor than rich countries [2], and data from Pakistan and India suggest that within countries the poor are more likely to be blind [3, 4]. Some blinding conditions are a direct consequence of poverty, notably trachoma, which thrives in poor areas lacking water and sanitation [20]. Other blinding diseases clearly contribute to poverty, such as onchocerciasis, which results in the abandonment of the fertile areas near to the rivers where the disease vector thrives [9]. A larger literature shows that poor <span class="yellow">people</span> are more likely to be ill or disabled than their richer compatriots, ranging from general disability in India, Bulgaria, and Ghana [21]; common mental disorders in Brazil, Chile, India, and Zimbabwe [22]; deafness in Brazil [23]; and tuberculosis in China [24]. There are also some exceptions such as a case-control study in Rwanda which failed to show an association between PCE and musculoskeletal impairment, perhaps because the population was almost universally poor [25].
Poverty may increase the incidence of disease, particularly preventable diseases such as tuberculosis. Poverty may also restrict access to appropriate health care and so prolong the duration of disease. A study in rural Tanzania showed that care-seeking behaviour for childhood illness is worse among poorer families than among the relatively rich families [26]. Another Tanzanian study found that <span class="yellow">people</span> with higher levels of asset ownership were more likely to obtain antimalarials even though they were less likely to be parasitaemic [27]. With respect to cataract, there is little evidence that prevention is possible, and so the main pathway from poverty to blindness is likely to be through reduced access to cataract surgical services. High health care costs may also exacerbate poverty. A study in rural China showed that ill health increases medical expenditure significantly, which detracts from expenditure on food, education, investment in farming, and participation in social activities [28]. Inability to afford cataract surgery is cited as the major barrier to the uptake of surgery in the surveys conducted in Kenya, the Philippines, and Bangladesh [6–8]. This indicates that the cost of surgery is perceived as substantial by many households, notwithstanding the problems of assessing the complex issue of barriers in the absence of in-depth qualitative interviews. Consequently, there are lower rates of cataract surgery among the poor [3].
Poverty may also limit the employment opportunities of the <span class="yellow">person</span> with disability or their household members. This pattern has been demonstrated for <span class="yellow">people</span> with <span class="yellow">HIV</span> in South Africa [29], tuberculosis in China [24], or disability in Sri Lanka [22]. An impact of blindness on reduced employment or income has been observed in Guinea [9] and India [4]. A belief that blindness reduces the employment opportunities of household members is widespread, but so far there is limited supportive evidence. There is a further complication to investigations of the relationship between cataract and poverty, as the individuals with cataract are likely to be elderly and facing multiple disabilities. Our study took account of the potential impact of multiple disabilities, as we adjusted for self-rated health, which is closely related to overall health, and this adjustment had no overall impact on our results [30].
Study Strengths
This was a large population-based case–control study, conducted in three countries, allowing international comparisons. This was the first study, to our knowledge, to relate PCE to visual impairment. We also measured assets, which reflects long-term access to resources, and self-rated wealth. We used expenditure as a proxy for income, which has aided both academic and nonacademic investigations. As one example, the notorious Chicago gangster Al Capone managed to escape prosecution for smuggling, gambling, bootlegging, and murder for years, but was eventually convicted of tax evasion, because the jury was convinced that his exorbitant expenses on clothes, furnishing, foods, and gifts were inconsistent with his claim that he had no income. Expenditure often provides a better measure of poverty than income for a number of reasons. Income may be variable by season, whereas households attempt to smooth expenditure over the year. <span class="yellow">People</span> are more comfortable sharing information about expenditure than income, and it may be a more meaningful measure than income in an agrarian society as it reflects what the household is able to command based on its current income, borrowing ability, or household savings [31]. PCE also has advantages over assets, as it may be more responsive to change, which will be important for the follow-up analyses of the study <span class="yellow">participants</span> after they have undergone cataract surgery.<br><br>Study Limitations
There are a number of limitations relating to the measurement of poverty in this study. Our analyses focus on monetary indicators of poverty, while we acknowledge that health, education, and housing are also important. We concede that it is difficult to measure expenditure accurately [32,33], but this also true for the measurement of diet and other variables, which is standard practise in many epidemiological studies. Furthermore, a large number of items were included in our measure of expenditure so that the measure was comprehensive [33]. Expenditure data were not validated through diaries or other means, although assets and self-rated wealth correlated highly with PCE. Other recent estimates of expenditure are not available from surveys conducted in these countries to allow comparison. The per capita estimates of monthly gross national income from the World Development Indicators database show somewhat higher estimates in Kenya (US$48) and Bangladesh (US$40) than our PCE derived estimates, and far higher estimates for the Philippines (US$108). This discrepancy may be reasonable, as the World Development Indicators reflect national averages, while we sampled the households with elderly <span class="yellow">people</span> in poor regions of the country, many of whom were visually impaired from cataract. PCE was calculated simply by dividing the total household expenditure by the number of household members, without inclusion of economies of scale or equivalence scales. There is no widely accepted alternative to the simple equal-sharing convention, and the majority of expenditure was on food which does not allow for economies of scale. Furthermore, there were slightly fewer <span class="yellow">people</span> of working age in the control households in Kenya and the Philippines, so adjustment for equivalence scores would be unlikely to explain the higher poverty among cases. The case and control households were of similar sizes in the three settings, so economies of scales are unlikely to have explained the differences.
There were a number of limitations relating to study design. Unfortunately, we did not record the exact numbers of cases and controls who refused to participate or were unable to communicate (believed to be fewer than five in each country), so the response rate is unknown, but was believed to be high. A variety of methods were used for case recruitment, as we were not able to obtain enough cases through the survey alone. However, cases recruited through the population-based survey and through case detection had similar poverty characteristics.<br><br>Conclusions
Our data show that <span class="yellow">people</span> with visual impairment due to cataract were poorer than controls in three low income countries, Bangladesh, Kenya, and the Philippines. The Millennium Development Goals are committed to the eradication of extreme poverty and provision of health care to poor <span class="yellow">people</span>. This study confirms an association between poverty and blindness and highlights the need for increased provision of cataract surgery to poor <span class="yellow">people</span>, particularly since cataract surgery is a highly cost-effective intervention in these settings [34].<br><br><br><br><h3>pmcA2556924</h3>Are there sensitive subgroups for the effects of airborne particles?
Abstract
Recent studies have shown that particulate air pollution is a risk factor for hospitalization for heart and lung disease; however, little is known about what subpopulations are most sensitive to this pollutant. We analyzed Medicare hospital admissions for heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders (COPD) and pneumonia in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois, between 1985 and 1994. We examined whether previous admissions or secondary diagnoses for selected conditions predisposed <span class="yellow">persons</span> to having a greater risk from air pollution. We also considered effect modification by age, sex, and race. We found that the air-pollution-associated increase in hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases was almost doubled in subjects with concurrent respiratory infections. The risk was also increased by a previous admission for conduction disorders. For COPD and pneumonia admissions, diagnosis of conduction disorders or dysrhythmias increased the risk of particulate matter < 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM(10))-associated admissions. <span class="blue">Persons</span> with asthma had twice the risk of a PM(10)-associated pneumonia admission and <span class="yellow">persons</span> with heart failure had twice the risk of PM(10)-induced COPD admissions. The PM(10) effect did not vary by sex, age, and race. These results suggest that <span class="yellow">patients</span> with acute respiratory infections or defects in the electrical control of the heart are a risk group for particulate matter effects.

Key words: effect modification, hospital admissions, particulate air pollution. Environ Health Perspect 108:841�845 (2000). [Online 28 July 2000] http://ehpnet1.niehs.nih.gov/docs/2000/108p841-845zanobetti/abstract.html <br><br> Particulate air pollution has been associated with increases in daily deaths and hospital admissions in studies all over the world (1�15). These associations are now well documented but little is known, as yet, of the characteristics of <span class="yellow">persons</span> that put them at increased risk of adverse events related to particulate air pollution. This has been identified as a key data gap (16). Schwartz and Dockery (17) reported that <span class="yellow">persons</span> older than 65 years of age had a somewhat increased risk of death, and this has been confirmed in other studies (18). A more detailed examination of particulate matter-related risk by deciles of age (19) showed the risk beginning to increase at approximately 40 years of age and reaching its maximum for those 75 years of age and older. In addition to age, several studies suggest that <span class="yellow">persons</span> with respiratory illness are at increased risk for cardiovascular effects associated with air pollution. An examination of death certificates on high- and low-air pollution days reported a substantial difference in the proportion of deaths from cardiovascular causes that had respiratory disease as a contributing cause of death (19). A recent follow-up study of a cohort of <span class="yellow">persons</span> with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Barcelona, Spain, found an association between particulate air pollution and all-cause mortality in the cohort (20). The magnitude of the risk per microgram per cubic meter of exposure was substantially greater than that for the general population. Environmental Health Perspectives <br><br> Controlled exposure of animals with chronic bronchitis and control animals to concentrated air particles also demonstrated a potentiating effect of chronic lung disease in the response to airborne particles (21). This has led to the hypothesis that the cardiovascular effects of air pollution are predominantly in <span class="yellow">persons</span> with chronic lung disease. There has been even less done to examine potential modifiers of the effects of airborne particles on hospital admissions. The existing literature on comorbidity shows that comorbidity per se seems to increase the risk of adverse outcomes (22�30). Little is known about the role of these comorbidities as effect modifiers for the effects of air pollution. This study uses data from the Medicare system to examine potential short-term and long-term medical conditions that may increase a <span class="yellow">person</span>'s risk of hospital admissions associated with particulate air pollution. In addition, we examine potential effect modification by age, race, and sex. <br><br> Materials and Methods Health data. The Health Care Financing Administration (Baltimore, MD) maintains records of every hospital admission for Medicare <span class="yellow">participants</span> in the United States. <span class="blue">Persons</span> in this database have a unique identifier. Using this identifier, we traced every hospital admission for heart and lung disease for each <span class="yellow">person</span> in Cook County, Illinois, between 1985 and 1994. We chose Cook County because it is the most populous <br><br> county in the United States with daily monitoring for particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 10 �m (PM10). The data were then analyzed to look at effect modification by concurrent and preexisting conditions as well as by age, race, and sex. To establish a baseline risk, we computed daily counts of hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease (CVD) [International Classification of Disease, 9th edition, World Health Organization, Geneva (ICD-9) code 390�429], pneumonia (ICD-9 code 480�487), and COPD (ICD-9 code 490�496, excluding 493). The association between these daily counts and PM10 was examined for the years 1988�1994, when daily PM10 monitoring data were available in Chicago. Once our baseline risks were established, we examined three classes of potential effect modifiers. First, we looked at whether previous admissions for selected conditions predisposed <span class="yellow">persons</span> to having a greater risk from air pollution. For each of the three admission categories (CVD, pneumonia, and COPD), we considered 10 causes (defined by a previous admission) as effect modifiers: COPD (ICD-9 code 490�496 except 493), asthma (ICD-9 code 493), acute bronchitis (ICD-9 code 466), acute respiratory illness (ICD-9 code 460�466), pneumonia (ICD-9 code 480�487), CVD (ICD-9 code 390�429), myocardial infarction (ICD-9 code 410), congestive heart failure (ICD-9 code 428), conduction disorders (ICD-9 code 426), and dysrhythmias (ICD9 code 427). To test the hypothesis that <span class="yellow">persons</span> with these conditions had higher risks of subsequent PM10-related admissions, we computed separate daily counts of admissions for our three target causes, stratified by whether or not the <span class="yellow">person</span> admitted had been previously admitted for the hypothesized predisposing condition. Separate analyses were then performed within each strata to see if the effects of PM10 differed by strata. Address correspondence to A.

These could represent the presence of a chronic condition (e.g., COPD) that has not resulted in a previous hospital admission. They could also represent acute conditions that may have increased the subjects' sensitivity to air pollution. For example, if respiratory infections modified the effect of particulate matter on the cardiovascular health of <span class="yellow">persons</span> with underlying heart disease, then the risk of a hospital admission for heart disease might be different in <span class="yellow">persons</span> with infections. If this were true, then the risk ratio of a 10-�g/m3 increase of PM10 on cardiovascular admissions of <span class="yellow">persons</span> with a concurrent respiratory infection would be different from the ratio in <span class="yellow">persons</span> without respiratory infection. To test these hypotheses, we computed separate daily counts of admissions for events with and without the concurrent conditions hypothesized to increase sensitivity to air pollution. These were taken as the same 10 conditions in the first analysis with certain exclusions for pairing that would be illogical. That is, the concurrent diagnosis of a specific cardiac condition was not treated as an effect modifier for admissions for any cardiovascular condition. Likewise, pneumonia and COPD were not possible concurrent conditions for each other. The third set of predisposing conditions considered was being older than 75 years of age, nonwhite, and female. These were examined for all three outcomes. We obtained weather data for O'Hare Airport from the EarthInfo CD-ROM (EarthInfo CD NCDC Surface Airways, EarthInfo Inc., Boulder, CO), and we obtained air pollution data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Aerometric Information Retrieval System network (31). <br><br> running-line smoother, loess (35), was chosen to estimate the smooth function. To control for weather variables and day of the week, we chose the smoothing parameter that minimized the Akaike's information criterion (36). To model seasonality we chose the smoothing parameter that minimized the sum of the autocorrelation of the residuals while removing seasonal patterns. Two autoregressive terms (37) were added in the model to eliminate the remaining serial correlation from the residuals. We used the mean of PM10 on the day of the admission and the day before the admission as our exposure variable. This gives results that are similar to those obtained fitting a full distributed lag model (38). PM10 was treated linearly. Our baseline models used the daily counts of CVD, pneumonia, and COPD admissions as outcomes. We then subdivided those counts by the presence or absence of the potential effect modifier and reestimated our regressions on those subgroups. We considered effect modification to be indicated when the estimates of PM10 in the group with the condition was outside of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the effect estimate in <span class="yellow">persons</span> without the condition. <br><br> Results Table 1 shows the mean daily admissions for COPD, cardiovascular, and pneumonia both overall and in the presence of the potential effect modifiers. For some effect modifiers such as conduction disorders or myocardial infarctions, the counts in conjunction with our respiratory outcomes are <br><br> low, which limits power. In general, the numbers are lower for examining effect modification by previous admissions than for effect modification by concurrent diagnosis. This is as expected because many clinically relevant comorbidities may never have resulted in a hospital admission. Table 2 shows the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile values for the environmental variables. The mean value for PM10 is 33 �g/m3. The daily values for PM10 were computed as the average of 10 monitors, two of which measured PM10 almost every day and the others less frequently (38). Table 3 shows the mean daily counts of CVD, COPD, and pneumonia by sex, age groups, and race. The distribution by sex is almost even, although the counts of admissions for males are generally lower (approximately 10%) than for females, particularly for cardiovascular diseases. The counts of CVD, COPD, and pneumonia admissions were similar for <span class="yellow">people</span> 65�75 or 75 years of age and older. Tables 4�6 show the results for the effect PM10 overall and stratifying by concurrent diagnosis and previous admissions. These are expressed as the percentage increase for 10 �g/m3 PM10. Table 4 shows the results for CVD. A 10-�g/m3 increase in PM10 was associated with a 1.31% (5% CI, 0.97%; 95% CI, 1.66%) increase in hospital admissions for heart disease in all elderly <span class="yellow">persons</span>. A concurrent (not previous) diagnosis of COPD modified the risk of PM10-associated admissions for heart disease. However, significant associations were still seen between PM10 <br><br> Table 1.

A significant association was also seen in <span class="yellow">persons</span> without any respiratory disease as a concurrent diagnosis, although the risk is much lower than in <span class="yellow">persons</span> with respiratory disease. However, the risk associated with PM10 was roughly doubled in subjects with concurrent respiratory infections and the risk estimates in those subjects were outside the 95% CI of the risk in <span class="yellow">patients</span> without concurrent respiratory infections.

In contrast heart failure and previous myocardial infarctions were highly insignificant as effect modifiers. Table 5 shows the results for COPD.

Previous admissions for any cardiovascular disease increased the risk of a PM10associated COPD admission approximately 2.5-fold. A previous heart failure admission caused an even more striking increase in the PM10 effect. Previous admissions for dysrhythmias and conduction defects were rare (Table 1) with no power to examine effect modifications. Listings as concurrent diagnoses were more common and here they joined heart failure in increasing the risk of PM 10 -associated COPD admissions. For COPD there was also some indication that concurrent pneumonia or an acute respiratory infection admission in the last year increased risk. The low numbers made these estimates less precise, however. The percentage increase in pneumonia admission (Table 6) for 10 �g/m3 PM10 is higher than for COPD or CVD with an increase of 2.34% (95% CI, 1.66�3.0). As with COPD, <span class="yellow">persons</span> with heart disease appeared at higher risk of pneumonia hospital admissions associated with particulate air pollution. Here diagnoses suggestive of impaired autonomic control of the heart, such as conduction disorders or dysrhythmias, were associated with increased risk for PM 10 effects on pneumonia admissions. Unlike COPD, no difference was seen for congestive heart failure. <span class="blue">Persons</span> with asthma Table 5.

Table 7 shows the results by sex, age, and race. None of the effect size estimates for any of the stratification variables were outside of the 95% CI for the opposite strata. There was a tendency for the effect of PM10 on CVD admissions to be higher for females, whereas the effect on pneumonia admissions was higher for males. In general, we found somewhat larger effects on whites compared to nonwhites, and for <span class="yellow">persons</span> older than 75 years of age compared to younger <span class="yellow">persons</span>. <br><br> Discussion In this analysis we examined whether the effect of PM10 on the risk of hospital admission for heart and lung disease was different depending on the presence of comorbidities. We found that PM10 was associated with hospital admissions for all three causes (CVD, COPD, and pneumonia) and we found not a general increase in PM10 related risk with comorbidities, but a specific pattern that is suggestive of potential mechanisms and consistent with other recent epidemiologic and toxicologic findings. One major finding of this study is that preexisting cardiovascular disease, particularly impaired autonomic control (conduction defects and dysrhythmias) and heart failure, substantially increased the risk of respiratory admissions associated with airborne particles. In fact, recent <span class="yellow">human</span> studies have shown that exposure to particulate air pollution is a risk factor for reduced heart rate variability (39�41). Reduced heart rate variability is an adverse response and a risk factor for arrhythmia. A new study of defibrillator discharges in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with implanted cardioverter defibrillators found that discharges were associated with air pollution (42).

This is the first study to suggest <span class="yellow">persons</span> with defects in the electrical control of the heart are also at higher risk of respiratory illness after exposure to airborne particles. These data also suggest that <span class="yellow">persons</span> admitted to hospitals for pneumonia during an air pollution episode may be at high risk for clinically significant conduction disorders during that hospital admission. <span class="yellow">Patients</span> with congestive heart failure were at greater risk of hospital admissions for COPD in association with airborne particles. Heart failure and COPD is not an uncommon combination. The finding that these <span class="yellow">patients</span> are at higher risk for admissions associated with particulate air pollution is new but is also consistent with several other recent reports. The spontaneous hypertensive <span class="yellow">rat</span> develops a model of heart failure, and recent studies have reported greater sensitivity to particulate air pollution in these <span class="yellow">rats</span>. These include both electrocardiogram abnormalities (44) and pulmonary toxicity (45,46). Similarly, in an epidemiologic study, Hoek et al. (47), found a higher relative risk of death with an increase in PM10 for congestive heart failure deaths than other deaths. The potential role of COPD in those heart failure deaths was not examined. Another consistent pattern in our data is of acute respiratory infections increasing susceptibility to airborne particles. Acute bronchitis, or more generally acute upper respiratory illnesses, as well as pneumonia, increased susceptibility to particle-associated admissions for CVD and COPD. The notion that air pollution exacerbates acute respiratory infections is well supported by studies which report associations between airborne particles and hospital admissions for respiratory infections (48,49). Zelikoff et al. (50) exposed <span class="yellow">rats</span> infected with streptococcus to concentrated air particles and reported a significant increase in bacterial burdens and in the extent of pneumonia compared to animals exposed to filtrated air. This suggests an impaired immune response. Similarly, exposure to combustion <br><br> particles enhances influenza infections in <span class="yellow">mice</span> (51). An impaired defense to respiratory infection is a major reason that <span class="yellow">persons</span> with COPD require hospital admission. If airborne particles result in further impairment the effect modification we observe makes good sense. The effect modification for heart disease admissions is more relevant. This modification is consistent with the earlier report of Schwartz (19), who found greater reports of respiratory complications on death certificates with an underlying cause of heart disease if the death occurred on a day with high levels of airborne particles. Although airborne particle exposure has been associated with increased exacerbation of asthma (2,12,48,52�59), this paper is the first to suggest that asthmatics are more susceptible to PM10-induced pneumonia exacerbation or to cardiovascular effects. The effects on pneumonia admissions are plausible, given the impaired ability to fight off infections in asthmatics with mucus plugs and the evidence the airborne particles impair the lungs' ability to fight off bacterial and viral infections, as noted earlier. The increased cardiovascular sensitivity, albeit weaker, is interesting. If airborne particles affect the cardiovascular system via the role of the lung in autonomic control, it is possible that asthmatics would be more sensitive to those effects. Animal models of asthma showed that combustion particles enhance the asthmatic response to aeroallergen challenges (59). This suggests an enhancement of pulmonary response in asthmatics. On the other hand, the diagnosis of asthma is problematic in the elderly, and crossover with COPD is possible. The possibility that this explains our results is reduced by our failure to find previous hospital admission for COPD was an effect modifier for the effect of particles on cardiovascular admissions. We must acknowledge several potential limitations of this study. First, we considered only previous admissions that occurred within Cook County. Hence <span class="yellow">persons</span> with previous admissions elsewhere would be misclassified to our reference group. The effect of this would be to reduce the difference in PM 10 effect between the two groups. VOLUME <br><br> Nevertheless, we identified some interesting interactions. We cannot exclude the possibility that there are areas we missed for this reason. We also examined interactions in a log relative risk model, which is inherently multiplicative. Although we believe this is justified because doubling the population exposed would be expected to double the pollution associated admissions, it results in a more conservative definition of interaction than would an additive risk model. Finally, our exposure is clearly measured with error. Most of this error is Berkson error (60) and hence will introduce no bias, and Zeger et al. (60) showed that the remaining error would have to have pathologic correlations with other variables to result in an upward bias. Another important result from this study, of course, is an estimate of the magnitude of the effect of airborne particles on public health. The PM10 concentrations in Chicago during this period were associated with approximately 1,600 additional admissions per year for heart disease, 740 additional admissions per year for pneumonia, and 170 additional admissions per year for COPD. These are not trivial increases in serious morbidity. The results of our study should be replicated in additional cities, although they do begin to fill in some missing information about the effects of airborne particles on health. More generally airborne particles have been associated with a broad range of systemic changes including heart rate variability (39�41), increased peripheral neutrophils (61�63), increased plasma viscosity (64), an increase in blood pressure (65), and the outcomes mentioned previously. The role of these systemic changes as potential sources of the specific effect modifications we have seen should be an area of fruitful research in the future. REFERENCES AND NOTES 1.
