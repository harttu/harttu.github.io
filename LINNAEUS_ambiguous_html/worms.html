Abstract
Cytoplasmic dynein is a microtubule-dependent motor protein that functions in mitotic cells during centrosome separation, metaphase chromosome congression, anaphase spindle elongation, and chromosome segregation. Dynein is also utilized during interphase for vesicle transport and organelle positioning. While numerous cellular processes require cytoplasmic dynein, the mechanisms that target and regulate this microtubule motor remain largely unknown. By screening a conditional <span class="yellow">Caenorhabditis elegans</span> cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain mutant at a semipermissive temperature with a genome-wide RNA interference library to reduce gene functions, we have isolated and characterized twenty dynein-specific suppressor genes. When reduced in function, these genes suppress dynein mutants but not other conditionally mutant loci, and twelve of the 20 specific suppressors do not exhibit sterile or lethal phenotypes when their function is reduced in wild-type <span class="blue">worms</span>. Many of the suppressor proteins, including two dynein light chains, localize to subcellular sites that overlap with those reported by others for the dynein heavy chain. Furthermore, knocking down any one of four putative dynein accessory chains suppresses the conditional heavy chain mutants, suggesting that some accessory chains negatively regulate heavy chain function. We also identified 29 additional genes that, when reduced in function, suppress conditional mutations not only in dynein but also in loci required for unrelated essential processes. In conclusion, we have identified twenty genes that in many cases are not essential themselves but are conserved and when reduced in function can suppress conditionally lethal <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain mutants. We conclude that conserved but nonessential genes contribute to dynein function during the essential process of mitosis.
Microtubules and microtubule-dependent motor proteins segregate chromosomes during mitosis and also promote cellular organization in nondividing cells. An essential motor protein complex called cytoplasmic dynein powers many aspects of microtubule-dependent transport, but it is currently unclear how dynein is regulated such that it can execute different processes. We have performed a genome-wide screen to isolate genes that are involved in dynein-dependent processes. We determined that 20 of the 49 genes we identified specifically influenced the viability of dynein mutant strains but not the viability of other <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> mutants. Many of the proteins that specifically influence dynein localized to subcellular sites where the dynein heavy chain has been reported by others to be found. Additionally, we identified four dynein components that appear to negatively regulate the force-generating dynein heavy chain. The identification and initial characterization of this group of genes represents a route to identify genes that are not themselves essential but do participate in essential processes.<br><br><br><br>Introduction
The microtubule motor called cytoplasmic dynein has roles in diverse cellular processes including meiotic and mitotic spindle assembly and function, neuronal transport, and organelle positioning [1]. Cytoplasmic dynein is composed of a dimer of heavy chains (HCs), along with several accessory chains (ACs: intermediate, light intermediate, and light chains). Other dynein-interacting proteins, such as dynactin and LIS1, are likely present at substoichiometric levels and further modulate dynein function. The HCs contain both ATPase and microtubule binding activities and are sufficient for microtubule-based motility in vitro, moving toward the minus, or slow-growing, end of microtubules [2]. The dynein ACs provide cargo docking sites and often are encoded by multigene families in any one species [reviewed in 1,3]. In <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>, a single gene called dhc-1 encodes a cytoplasmic dynein 1 HC, while 11 other genes encode five classes of predicted dynein ACs [3,4].
The early <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> embryo is an excellent system for investigating gene contributions for essential cellular processes, including cytoskeletal functions [5]. The <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> dynein HC DHC-1 is essential and required for multiple microtubule-dependent events during early embryogenesis [6–9]. Depletion of DHC-1 by RNA interference (RNAi) in early <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> embryos produces defects in female meiotic divisions, migration of the oocyte and sperm pronuclei after fertilization, and centrosome separation during mitotic spindle assembly [6]. Analysis of fast-acting dhc-1 temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants has further revealed that dynein is required for chromosome congression to the metaphase plate during mitosis, as well as for mitotic spindle positioning [10].
While many requirements for cytoplasmic dynein are known, our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that target and regulate dynein remains limited. Clearly, the multiple ACs can couple the dynein HC to particular substrates [11], including vesicles, nuclei, viruses, kinetochores, and rhodopsin [see table in 1]. However, reducing the function of only four of the eleven dynein ACs in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> produces lethal phenotypes [12]. Thus, it remains unclear how ACs influence the different essential requirements for dynein. Another potential route for dynein regulation involves the phosphorylation state of the different dynein chains, which in some cases confers distinctive functional properties to the motor. While many examples of dynein phosphorylation exist, and cell cycle dependent changes in phosphorylation have been described [13–15], few if any studies have demonstrated a requirement for such modification during mitosis. Large-scale forward genetic screens have identified genes with requirements similar to those for dynein, but many of these encode core components of the microtubule cytoskeleton and few are known to directly influence dynein itself [12,16]. Genes that do influence dynein function might also have other essential roles, leading to pleiotropic mutant phenotypes that obscure their relationship to dynein [17–19]. Moreover, redundancy within the multigene dynein subunit families, and also perhaps between the different ACs, may complicate the identification of single gene requirements that are important for dynein function. Thus far, reducing the function of individual genes has not provided substantial insight into the mechanisms that regulate and mediate the many different requirements for cytoplasmic dynein during mitosis.
To identify potential regulators of cytoplasmic dynein, we have used a sensitized genetic background to conduct a genome-wide screen for modifiers of dynein function in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>. Other groups have successfully used RNAi modifier screens to identify genes that function in particular pathways [20–23]; we have used RNAi to screen for genes that, when reduced in function, suppress the embryonic lethality associated with a temperature-sensitive (ts) allele of the dhc-1 dynein HC gene. Using the dhc-1ts genetic background, we found 49 genes that, when depleted, suppress the partial loss of HC function. Twenty of these genes suppress conditional dynein HC mutants but not other conditional mutants with unrelated defects. Finally, we show that some of these dynein-specific suppressors encode proteins that may overlap with the dynein HC in subcellular localization.<br><br>Results
To identify dynein suppressors, we used three different conditional and recessive dhc-1 mutants that were identified previously [7]. These ts alleles of dhc-1 (or195, or283, and or352) produce similar defects at the restrictive temperature of 26 °C, including incomplete mitotic spindle assembly in one-cell embryos and embryonic lethality [7]. We sequenced the dhc-1 locus in the three mutants. The independently isolated or195 and or283 alleles each change a conserved serine to leucine at codon 3200, within the coiled-coil region of the microtubule-binding stalk domain (Figure 1A and 1C). The or352 allele replaces a conserved glycine with aspartic acid at codon 2158, in the ATP-binding walker A motif of the second AAA ATPase domain (Figure 1B and 1C). As both missense mutations affect conserved residues, they may prove useful for engineering ts alleles in other organisms. The temperature versus viability curves of the dynein ts mutants feature a steep central transition zone ideal for modifier screening because subtle changes in temperature produce large changes in embryonic viability (Figure 2A).
To identify genes that, when reduced in function, can suppress conditional dhc-1 mutants, we developed a high-throughput RNAi-based screen (Figure 2B). To reduce gene function we used a library of 16,757 bacterial strains that each express a dsRNA corresponding to exon-rich gene sequences [17,19]. We then tested over 99% of the bacterial strains in this library for RNAi-mediated suppression of dhc-1(or195) embryonic lethality at 23 °C, after raising synchronized L1 larvae to adulthood on dsRNA-expressing bacterial lawns in 48-well agar plates. This screening procedure should work to identify nonessential and essential suppressor genes, because RNAi does not always fully reduce gene function [24,25], and even if RNAi does produce lethality, cosuppression could restore viability. Nevertheless, essential genes may be missed due to earlier requirements that produce strong larval arrest, sterile, or embryonic lethal phenotypes.
Using this screening procedure, we identified 49 bacterial clones that consistently increased embryonic viability at the semipermissive temperature. The dsRNA-producing plasmids were then sequenced to verify gene identity. Quantification of embryonic viability using dhc-1(or195) animals showed that the RNAi-mediated depletion of suppressor gene function increased viability to 5%–100%, compared to less than 2% in unsuppressed controls (Figure 3A; Table S1). The proteins encoded by the suppressor genes we identified are summarized in Figure 4.
As a more direct assay for dynein activity in the suppressed dhc-1 embryos, we measured spindle length and cytokinesis success: dhc-1 mutant embryos have severe spindle assembly defects and subsequent cytokinesis failures [6,7,10]. We shifted dhc-1 adult hermaphrodites from 23 °C to the fully restrictive temperature of 26 °C for 3–5 hours and made time-lapse video micrographs using Nomarski optics to monitor the first embryonic cell division. This procedure results in dhc-1(or195) embryos with P0 spindles 30% the length of wild-type spindles (Figure S1). In the suppressed dhc-1(or195) backgrounds, spindle lengths ranged from 30%–83% of wild-type lengths (Figure S1). Similarly, cytokinesis failed in unsuppressed dhc-1(or195) embryos 89% of the time, but most of the suppressors rescued this phenotype (Figure S1). These results indicate that most of the suppressors influence dynein-dependent cellular processes, as expected given their ability to restore viability when reduced in function.
Specificity of Suppression
Because RNAi can reduce the function of unintended targets (so-called “off-target effects” [26,27]), we also used available mutations in some of the suppressor genes we identified to reduce their function. We constructed double mutant strains using dhc-1(or195) and viable deletion alleles for two suppressor genes, dylt-1(ok417) and ufd-2(tm1380), and examined embryonic viability (Figure 3B). The deletion alleles of dylt-1 (encoding a Tctex1-type dynein light chain), and ufd-2 (encoding a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme) both recapitulated the suppression produced by RNAi knockdown (Figure 3B). The dpy-3(e27) and dpy-10(e128) point mutation alleles [28] also suppressed embryonic lethality in double mutants (Figure 3B). Based on this small sampling, and because RNAi in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> appears to be highly gene specific in the absence of close paralogs [12,19], we conclude that many of the suppressors we have identified will prove to be suppressor locus specific. The dsRNA-expressing bacterial clones we used to deplete two of the dynein suppressors (tag-300 and ZK1127.10) probably also knock down expression of one close paralog for each locus [29].
We next asked whether the suppressors are specific for dynein function or if their depletion more generally stabilizes ts proteins. We tested for specificity using two conditional mutants with cell fate patterning defects unrelated to dynein function, lit-1(or131) and spn-4(or191). The lit-1 gene encodes a MAP kinase-related protein [30], while spn-4 encodes a protein with an RNA binding motif [31]. We found that ten of the dhc-1-interacting genes significantly increased embryonic viability in both lit-1 and spn-4 mutants, while 18 others suppressed one or the other of these two conditional mutants when reduced in function using the same RNAi protocol as that used for dhc-1ts mutants (Figure 4, right two columns; Table S1). Therefore, about half of the suppressors appear to act nonspecifically on multiple ts mutants to restore embryonic viability. From here on, we will refer to the suppressors that only acted on dhc-1, and not on lit-1 and spn-4 ts mutants, as dynein-specific suppressors.
Because many ts mutations exert their effect via protein assembly or unfolding mechanisms [32], suppressor genes reduced in function by RNAi might not be expected to exhibit allele specificity with most ts mutations. To determine if the dynein suppressors are either allele or strain specific, we tested the two other conditional dhc-1 strains (containing the or283 and or352 alleles). Although the or283 allele is identical to or195, it provides a useful control for the presence of background mutations because the two strains were isolated independently. In most cases, depletion of the dynein-specific suppressors also restored viability to the other two ts dhc-1 alleles. Y40B1B.5, a putative translation initiation factor, suppressed only one conditional dhc-1 strain, and we consider this as an example of a nonspecific interaction (Figure 4, left three columns; Table S1). Two dsRNAs that do not suppress lit-1 or spn-4 mutants produced suppression in the dhc-1(or195) and dhc-1(or283) strains, but not in the dhc-1(or352) strain, perhaps indicating allele specificity or variability in the RNAi treatments. We conclude that strain background differences are relatively rare, and that the majority of the suppressors are allele-independent. To summarize, we have identified 20 genes that when reduced in function specifically suppress multiple dynein ts strains but not unrelated ts loci.<br><br>Survey of Putative Dynein Accessory Chains
We were surprised to discover that depleting two predicted dynein ACs specifically suppressed the partial loss of HC function, because most dynein accessory subunits are presumed to promote dynein function by aiding dynein complex formation or mediating cargo attachment [3,11,33]. Depletion of either dylt-1 (encoding a Tctex1-type light chain) or dyrb-1 (encoding a roadblock-type light chain) suppressed embryonic lethality in all three ts dynein HC mutant strains (Figure 4). To extend this observation, we surveyed all genes encoding predicted dynein components for suppression of the three ts dhc-1 mutants (Figure 5A; Table S2). We reasoned that some dynein subunit genes could have been missed in the primary screening and several dynein AC genes were not represented in the <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> RNAi library. After using RNAi to reduce their function, we found that one of three Tctex1 homologs (dylt-1), one of four LC8 homologs (dlc-1), one of two light intermediate chains (dli-1), as well as the sole roadblock homolog (dyrb-1) each strongly suppressed the three conditional dynein mutants. Lower-level suppression was also seen for the second light intermediate chain, xbx-1, when its function was reduced. Thus, one gene of each of four subunit classes restores viability to the three dhc-1 mutant strains when depleted by RNAi.
The only subunit class not found to suppress was the intermediate chain, encoded by a single gene in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>, dyci-1. When reduced in function by RNAi, dyci-1 produces a larval arrest phenotype like that observed for dhc-1(RNAi); this phenotype precludes any suppression of the conditional embryonic lethality (shown as “la” in Figure 5A). In contrast, knockdown of either dlc-1 or dli-1 suppresses embryonic lethality in the dhc-1ts mutants, even though reducing their function in otherwise wild-type embryos produces dhc-1-like defects, including embryonic lethality [12,34] (see Figure 5B and Discussion). The suppressing cytoplasmic dynein subunits and DYCI-1 are shown in a putative complex in Figure 5E.
We performed several genetic assays to better understand how the suppressor genes may be operating. First, suppression of dhc-1 lethality by reducing AC function may indicate that our dhc-1 alleles express a neomorphic and toxic DHC-1 protein: if the suppressor dynein AC subunits positively function in dynein processes, depleting them might suppress any neomorphic effects. This explanation is perhaps unlikely, because the dhc-1ts alleles are all recessive, but remained a possibility in dhc-1 homozygotes. We therefore reduced dynein function using RNAi in animals that had passed through the larval arrest points for dhc-1(RNAi) and dyci-1(RNAi). Specifically, we transferred dhc-1(or195) L4 hermaphrodites to plates with bacteria expressing dhc-1 or dyci-1 dsRNA. As control we performed dylt-1(RNAi) using the same procedure. We observed substantial suppression with dylt-1 in this assay, but we saw no suppression with the heavy or intermediate chains (Figure 5C). This suggests that the DHC-1ts protein is not toxic and that dyci-1 acts more like dhc-1 than the other suppressing ACs because it does not suppress the heavy chain mutant.
To further examine the nature of the AC suppression, we asked if depletion of the suppressor chains could bypass the requirement for dhc-1. We transferred wild-type L4 larvae to plates with bacteria expressing dsRNA corresponding to both the suppressor ACs and dhc-1. We did not observe any suppression in these double RNAi assays (Figure 5D), suggesting that dhc-1ts suppression requires the residual activity of the defective DHC-1 protein. We conclude that the dynein AC suppressors inhibit or somehow oppose the function of the DHC-1ts protein, and that the dhc-1(or195ts) mutation does not produce a toxic gene product but simply reduces DHC-1 activity to a low, but non-null, level.<br><br>Localization of the Dynein Suppressor Proteins
To further explore how the suppressor proteins function, we examined the subcellular localization of nine of them as stably expressed N-terminal GFP::S fusions. We chose to first focus on the suppressor genes that were conserved but poorly characterized in any system, or were conserved but uncharacterized during early <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> embryogenesis. Prior dynein immunocytochemistry-based localization studies serve as a comparison [6,10,35]. As in other species, <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> DHC-1 is associated with mitotic spindles, centrosomes, the nuclear envelope, the cell cortex, the midbody, and throughout the cytoplasm. Most of the suppressor proteins we examined localized to sites where DHC-1 is known to act or localize (Figure 6). However, the nearly ubiquitous distribution of DHC-1 in early embryonic cells makes colocalization likely but not necessarily meaningful, and biochemical studies are needed to conclusively address any direct or indirect physical associations.
Four suppressor GFP fusion proteins localized to nuclear membranes and to spindle poles or pericentrosomal regions. The DYLT-1 and DYRB-1 dynein light chains were associated with nuclear envelopes and centrosomes, as well as meiotic and mitotic spindle poles (Figure 6A–6H; Videos S1 and S2). The potential coiled-coil protein K04F10.3 was present on the nuclear envelope and in a pericentrosomal position during mitosis, similar to endoplasmic reticulum proteins [36] (Figure 6I–6L; Video S3). K04F10.3 was also highly enriched at meiotic spindle poles (Figure 6I), which has been observed for other endoplasmic reticulum proteins [36]. The NPP-22 transmembrane nucleoporin was found at nuclear envelopes (Figure 6M–6P; Video S4), as previously reported for later stage embryos [37], and it also surrounded centrosomes during mitosis. Two splice isoforms of the pleckstrin homology domain–containing EFA-6/Y55D9A.1, an ARF guanine nucleotide exchange factor, were enriched cortically both in the anterior portion of the one-cell zygote and at the blastomere boundary in two-cell embryos (Figure 6Q–6T; Videos S5 and S6). The conserved Mo25 homolog MOP-25.2/Y53C12A.4 was found enriched in a single spot after cytokinesis that appears to correspond to the midbody (Figure 6U–6X; Video S7). F10E7.8, a highly conserved ortholog of <span class="yellow">S. cerevisiae</span> Far11, appears nuclear (Figure 6Y–6B′ and Video S8). Finally, the nonspecific suppressor protein STAR-2, a predicted RNA binding protein, appears to be associated with P-granules (like its homolog GLD-1), where dynein is neither localized nor known to function (Figure 6C′–6F′).<br><br>DLYT-1 and DYRB-1: Dynein Light Chain Localization
The <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> dynein HC protein weakly localizes to spindle poles during early embryonic cell cycles [6,10], and so did DYRB-1 and DYLT-1 (Videos S9 and S10). However, ts mutant forms of the DHC-1 protein (including DHC-1 encoded by the or195 allele) strongly localize to centrosomes when shifted to the non-permissive temperature [10]. The mechanism underlying this enhanced localization is not known, but it may represent trapping of the defective protein at a normally transient location. We exploited this behavior of the mutant DHC-1 protein to determine whether redistribution of the putative DYRB-1 and DYLT-1 dynein light chains also occurred in the dhc-1(or195) background.
We found that the cellular distributions of DYRB-1 and DYLT-1 were dramatically altered in dhc-1(or195) mutant embryos. After shifting the parental <span class="blue">worms</span> to the restrictive temperature for 3–5 h prior to collecting embryos, these two proteins were prominently localized to centrosomes and to spindle poles that did not separate in one-cell stage embryos (Figure 7; Videos S11 and S12). The spindle pole to cytoplasmic fluorescence ratio during late anaphase was 5-fold higher in both of the dhc-1 homozygous mutant strains when compared to wild-type embryos expressing the GFP fusions. We also assayed localization of the two putative dynein light chains after short temperature shifts to the nonpermissive temperature in the dhc-1(or195) mutant background, which yields mitotic spindles with an overall wild-type appearance and function. These short temperature shifts also resulted in robust localization of these two dynein light chains to centrosomes (unpublished data). Finally, we examined the localization of GFP::DYRB-1 and GFP::DYLT-1 in embryos from dhc-1(or195) −/+ <span class="blue">worms</span> grown at the dhc-1(or195) permissive temperature of 15 °C. Even though embryos from mothers heterozygous for this recessive mutation are viable and develop normally, even at 26 °C [7], we observed a substantial increase in both GFP fusion proteins at the mitotic spindle poles in early embryos (Figure 7; Videos S13 and S14). Importantly, localization of DYLT-1 and DYRB-1 to centrosomes does not occur in embryos depleted for DHC-1 with RNAi (our unpublished results), indicating that these proteins require the mutant DHC-1 polypeptide for centrosomal targeting in the dhc-1(or195) embryos. In summary, the DYRB-1 and DYLT-1 proteins localize to sites where the DHC-1 HC is also found in wild-type embryos, and all three proteins respond similarly to mutational alterations in DHC-1.<br><br>Genetic Characterization of the DYLT-1 and DYRB-1 Dynein Light Chains
We obtained putative null alleles to determine if dylt-1 and dyrb-1 function in dynein-dependent processes. DYLT-1 is 40% identical to <span class="yellow">human</span> DYNLT3 and 38% identical to <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> Dlc90F (see alignment in Figure 8A). Two other <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> genes, dylt-2 and dylt-3, encode more divergent members of this protein family. DYRB-1 is 49% identical to both <span class="yellow">human</span> DYNLRB1 and <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> Robl (see alignment in Figure 8A). There do not appear to be other Roadblock genes in the <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> genome [3]. Deletion alleles for both dylt-1 and dyrb-1 have been isolated (Figure 8B). The dylt-1(ok417) deletion removes the entire DYLT-1 open reading frame and does not affect adjacent coding regions. The dyrb-1(tm2645) deletion removes 69% of the dyrb-1 coding region, leaving 29 predicted N-terminal amino acids, and does not affect adjacent coding regions.
Both deletions are currently annotated as homozygous viable [29]. However, we found that the dyrb-1(tm2645) strain was in fact heterozygous for the deletion and that most embryos produced by dyrb-1(tm2645) homozygous animals failed to hatch (Figure 8C). Homozygous dyrb-1(tm2645) <span class="blue">worms</span> also showed an egg-laying defect and produced small broods (unpublished data). To determine if the dyrb-1 deletion was responsible for the embryonic lethality, we crossed the GFP::dyrb-1 transgene into the deletion background. The presence of the transgene fully rescued the embryonic lethality (Figure 8C), but not the egg-laying defect: the transgene is driven from a germline-specific promoter and so would not be expected to rescue zygotic phenotypes. The embryonic lethality exhibited by dyrb-1(tm2645) mutants is consistent with RNAi studies performed by injection or soaking [12,38]. In contrast, homozygous dylt-1 deletion mutants did not exhibit any larval or embryonic lethality (Figure 8C).
To determine if these dynein light chain mutants exhibit dynein HC-like phenotypes, we observed the completion of meiotic polar body extrusion and the first two mitotic cell divisions in mutant embryos (Figure 8D). The dylt-1 embryos appeared wild type for completion of meiosis, pronuclear migration, and spindle assembly and function. However, the dyrb-1 embryos occasionally contained extra female pronuclei (observed in four of 12 recordings, Figure 8D), suggesting that polar body extrusion was defective, and pronuclear migration was often slow compared to wild-type embryos. Once formed, spindles appeared functional using Nomarski optics, although they were frequently positioned improperly and had large spindle poles, as has also been observed after RNAi knockdown [12]. Thus, these two genes are not strictly essential, but the DYRB-1 protein clearly is required for dynein-dependent processes.<br><br>
Discussion
By using the suppressor screening method outlined in Figure 2B, we have isolated and characterized 49 genes that when reduced in function can suppress a partial loss of dynein HC function. This screening procedure takes advantage of sensitized genetic backgrounds using conditional mutants, can be completed for one mutant in less than 5 wk, and is scalable so that many mutants can be screened in parallel. In fact, we have performed 15 such screens in different sensitized backgrounds (unpublished data). By using three dhc-1ts mutant strains, we found that strain background differences and allele specificity are minimal because most of these genes suppress all three dynein mutants when reduced in function using RNAi. Furthermore, by using two unrelated ts mutants to assay for specificity, we found that 57% of the suppressor genes suppress multiple unrelated mutant loci. Thus, it is clear that assaying the specificity of suppression is critical for evaluating the functional significance of these RNAi interactions. Eliminating the analysis of these nonspecific genes in future screens will save time and resources. Most of the specific suppressor proteins we examined appear to overlap in subcellular localization with the dynein HC, based on previous studies of DHC-1, while one nonspecific suppressor protein, STAR-2, localized to germline P-granules, where dynein is not known to function.
Many of the 20 genes that specifically suppress multiple dhc-1ts alleles are nonessential in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> but well conserved nonetheless. Six of eight deletion alleles available for the 20 specific suppressor genes are homozygous viable, and six additional specific genes do not display lethal phenotypes when reduced in function by RNAi in wild-type <span class="blue">worms</span> [29]. Thus, our genetic screening has identified roles in an essential process for at least 12 apparently nonessential genes. Fourteen of the specific dynein suppressor genes have <span class="yellow">human</span> orthologs as determined by best reciprocal BLAST hits (Table 1), while mop-25.2 has a conserved <span class="yellow">human</span> homolog but also a paralog in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>. Eleven of these conserved genes are nonessential in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>. Interestingly, eight of the conserved genes in Table 1 have been implicated in <span class="yellow">human</span> disease etiology, with three of them identified as the causative gene [39–41]. Thus, using sensitized genetic backgrounds for genome-wide modifier screens can identify roles for nonessential but conserved genes and thereby provide insights into <span class="yellow">human</span> disease.
Nonspecific Suppression of Conditional Mutants
We examined the predicted molecular functions of the suppressor proteins to better understand the basis for the nonspecific suppression phenomenon. Strikingly, many of the nonspecific suppressor genes encode proteins with predicted roles in mitochondrial, ribosomal, and collagen function (18 of 29 genes, or 62%), while only two such genes appeared to specifically suppress dhc-1 (2 of 20 genes or 10%). It is possible that stress produced by RNAi knockdown of these suppressor genes triggers the activity of molecular chaperones that can generally restore function to ts proteins. Indeed, mutation of dpy-10 is known to suppress three other ts mutants: glp-1, emb-5, and mup-1 [42–44]. Furthermore, RNAi reduction of dpy-10, star-2, osr-1, or C50D2.1 (all suppressors of dhc-1, lit-1, and spn-4 ts alleles) induces the glycerol biosynthetic gene gpdh-2, while dpy-10 and osr-1 mutants exhibit increased glycerol levels, a condition that promotes protein stability [45]. We suggest that partial loss of central metabolic processes can invoke stress responses that nonspecifically alleviate protein-folding problems in ts proteins. Filtering out these nonspecific interactions by testing unrelated conditional mutants increases the likelihood that the remaining suppressor genes are more directly involved with dynein function. However, ts mutants likely differ in their susceptibility to nonspecific suppression mechanisms, and some apparently unrelated ts mutants might share common cofactors such that both mutants are suppressed by depletion of the same cofactor. Nevertheless, we expect that more extensive testing for specificity will prove very useful for judging the significance of modifier interactions.<br><br>Possible Relevance of Suppressor Proteins to Dynein Function
We examined the localization of a number of GFP fusions to suppressor proteins to gain insight into their functional relationship to dynein. In several cases, the subcellular distribution of the suppressor proteins overlapped in different ways with the known and nearly ubiquitous distribution of cytoplasmic dynein in the early <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> embryo. In fact, the only specific suppressor that did not display dynein-like localization was F10E7.8, a homolog of <span class="yellow">yeast</span> Far11 of unknown function [46], which was nuclear. The one nonspecific suppressor protein we examined did not show any dynein-like localization patterns. The subcellular localizations of the GFP::suppressor protein fusions are intriguing. However, given the nearly ubiquitous distribution of dynein in early embryonic cells, biochemical tests for direct association are needed to address the significance of any colocalization detected using light microscopy.
We are particularly interested in suppressor proteins that localize to mitotic spindle poles: the association of the DYLT-1 and DYRB-1 predicted dynein light chains with centrosomes and spindle poles suggests that they may be components of cytoplasmic dynein in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>. Localization of cytoplasmic dynein to centrosomes and spindle poles is well established [47,48], and the inhibition of dynein function prevents centrosome separation, centrosome attachment to nuclei, and the formation of bipolar spindles [6,10,49,50]. Moreover, the centrosomal localization of DHC-1, DYLT-1, and DYRB-1 are all greatly enhanced in dhc-1ts mutant embryos: this dependence of the light chain distribution on the HC further suggests they reside in the same motor complex (Figure 7 and [10]). Furthermore, roadblock light chains are well-established components of dynein, and all of the roadblock protein in mammalian liver extracts is dynein associated [51,52]. Finally, a DYLT-1 homolog in vertebrates is a stoichiometric subunit of cytoplasmic dynein [53]. The presence of these two light chains in a dynein complex is consistent with them having either positive or negative roles in the regulation of HC function (see below).
Cytoplasmic dynein is found on the nuclear envelope where it is thought to regulate nuclear membrane breakdown during mitosis [54], and dynein plays roles during the trafficking of endoplasmic reticulum components [55,56]. Therefore, the nuclear envelope/endoplasmic reticulum proteins NPP-22 and K04F10.3 could couple dynein activity to either of these structures. The anc-1 gene was also isolated in our screening and ANC-1 is localized to the nuclear envelope where it maintains nuclear positioning in postembryonic cells [57]. Reducing the function of these three genes may suppress partial loss of dynein HC mutants by reducing the need for dynein during nuclear envelope breakdown, through constitutive partial destabilization of the nuclear envelope.
The distribution of the cytoplasmic dynein HC includes sites other than spindle poles and nuclear envelopes in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>, for example, at the cell cortex and at the cell division remnant called the midbody [6,10]. The MOP-25.2 protein was found at the midbody and faintly at spindle poles. The MOP-25.2 ortholog in <span class="yellow">S. pombe</span>, Pmo25, is also present at the cell division site and on spindle poles [58]. Mammalian MOP-25.2 homologs stimulate the kinase activity of the LKB1 tumor suppressor (the <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> ortholog is PAR-4), which in turn activates MARK microtubule-destabilizing kinases [59,60]. The <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> MARK ortholog, PAR-1, controls cell polarity during embryogenesis, and orthologs have been implicated in regulation of microtubule dynamics from <span class="yellow">yeast</span> to <span class="yellow">humans</span> [61–64].
Lastly, the two splice isoforms of EFA-6 were associated with the anterior cell cortex in late one-cell embryos. Cortically localized dynein may have important roles in applying forces to astral microtubules that influence mitotic spindle positioning and chromosome separation during anaphase [10,65,66]. EFA6 ARF guanine nucleotide exchange factors require their pleckstrin homology domain for cortical targeting, and are known to regulate cortical actin dynamics in vertebrate cells by promoting guanine nucleotide exchange on ARF6 [67,68]. Our results identifying efa-6 as a dynein HC suppressor suggest a functional linkage of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons at the cell cortex. Interestingly, two <span class="yellow">yeast</span> pleckstrin homology domain proteins, Num1 and mcp5+, localize to the cell cortex and direct astral microtubule and dynein function, although they do not contain a Sec7 domain like EFA-6 does [69–71].<br><br>Function of Dynein Intermediate, Light Intermediate, and Light Chains
The dynein chains in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> exhibit strikingly different functional requirements. The DYRB-1 roadblock light chain is required for completion of meiosis and pronuclear migration, but an at least partially functional mitotic spindle forms in the absence of DYRB-1 (Figure 8). The DLI-1 light intermediate chain is required for multiple dynein-dependent functions: pronuclear migration, centrosome separation, and meiotic and mitotic spindle function [12,34]. DLI-1 may promote nuclear envelope targeting of both centrosomes and DHC-1 by interacting with the nuclear envelope protein ZYG-12 [35]. The second worm light intermediate chain gene, xbx-1, is required for cilia function but not early embryonic development [12,72]. RNAi knockdown of DLC-1, one of three LC8 proteins in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>, produces defects similar to dli-1 but knockdown of the other two LC8-related genes does not result in any phenotypes [12]. RNAi depletion of dyci-1 results in severe meiotic, pronuclear migration, and mitotic spindle assembly defects [12] and in our feeding RNAi regimen dyci-1(RNAi) produces a larval arrest phenotype similar to that observed for dhc-1. Finally, the three Tctex1 proteins in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>, DYLT-1, 2, and 3, are not essential for dynein-related functions [12]. As the dyrb-1, dlc-1, and dli-1 dynein AC genes display some dhc-1-like requirements, they positively influence dynein function. However, because reducing their function suppresses dhc-1ts mutants, they may also exert negative regulation (along with dylt-1) on the heavy chain.<br><br>Negative Regulation of Dynein HC by Light Chain Subunits
Finding that reducing the function of light and light intermediate dynein chains suppressed the partial loss of HC function was a striking result. One member of each of four subunit classes can suppress the embryonic lethality associated with three dhc-1 ts mutants (Figure 5). We have considered two different models to explain how RNAi-mediated depletion of these dynein ACs can suppress reduced HC function. First, these dynein subunits could be in functional complexes with, and exert negative regulation on, the DHC-1 HC (Figure 5B). The suppression mechanism in this case proposes that removal of the suppressing ACs increases residual mutant DHC-1 activity. The other, nonsuppressing, accessory subunits might then function in nonmitotic cellular processes such as neuronal transport or organelle positioning. In support of this view, physical removal of the intermediate chains of <span class="yellow">rat</span> cytoplasmic dynein increased HC ATPase activity by about 4-fold (light chains were not monitored in this study but were likely removed as well) [73]. Thus, at least with respect to ATPase activity, some dynein ACs do act as biochemical negative regulators of HC function.<br><br>An Assortment of Essential and Nonessential Dynein Complexes
Alternatively, an assortment of dynein complexes (with different ACs) could coexist within early embryonic cells, with only a subset required for the essential mitotic functions that require DHC-1. In this case, suppression might result from the release of DHC-1 HCs from less essential motor complexes, allowing more of the functionally compromised HCs to participate in the essential process of mitosis. We currently disfavor this hypothesis because two of the suppressing light chains (DYLT-1 and DYRB-1) can indeed localize to meiotic and mitotic spindles (Figures 6 and 7), sites where DHC-1 has been shown by others to localize and function. Furthermore, the distribution of DYRB-1 and DYLT-1 closely resembles the distribution of the HC in dhc-1(or195) embryos, suggesting that these two light chains associate with the HC during mitosis (Figure 7 and [10]). Finally, dhc-1-like phenotypes result from mutation or RNAi knockdown of three suppressing ACs in otherwise wild-type <span class="blue">worms</span>, indicating that they share at least some common and essential requirements. Regardless of the suppression mechanism, our identification of ACs that genetically interact with the DHC-1 HC provides a basis for functionally classifying the paralogs of these dynein subunit gene families, and for further investigation of dynein composition and function.<br><br>Nonessential Dynein Subunits and Negative Regulation of the HC
Some ACs are nonessential, supporting the view that some cytoplasmic dynein subunits could function by exerting negative regulation on the HC, rather than positively influencing essential HC function. For example, DYRB-1 is not absolutely required for viability because <span class="blue">worms</span> lacking this protein can be propagated, although they are extremely sick and do exhibit two dhc-1-like phenotypes (Figure 8). Also, homozygous dylt-1 deletion mutants appear fully viable (Figure 8). The two additional Tctex1 <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> genes could be functionally redundant with DYLT-1, but simultaneously reducing the function of DYLT-2 and DYLT-3 by RNAi in the dylt-1 deletion strain did not cause lethality (unpublished data). Because RNAi does not always completely reduce function, the question of redundancy in the Tctex1 <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> gene family remains unresolved. However, <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> contains only a single Tctex1 gene, Dlc90F [74,75]. A Dlc90F null allele that deletes 80% of the open reading frame is essential only for sperm production but not for viability of male or female <span class="yellow">flies</span>, despite the wild-type protein being incorporated into dynein motors and expressed in various <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> tissues [74]. Thus, at least in <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span>, the Tctex1 dynein light chain family is not required for cell division processes like the HC is. Interestingly, budding <span class="yellow">yeast</span> does not possess genes for the Tctex1 or roadblock ACs, indicating that functional cytoplasmic dynein does not require these subunits that are conserved in many other organisms. The AC genes that <span class="yellow">yeast</span> does posses are not required for HC motility in vitro because dynein purified from <span class="yellow">yeast</span> with mutations in these genes remains fully active [2]. Thus, dynein function in several contexts does not require AC subunits, and we suggest that in some cases they may have negative regulatory roles. Negative regulation of cytoplasmic dynein may be redundant with other modes of HC regulation or only required during special circumstances. Further studies of subunit localization, and in vitro studies of <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> dynein motility, may provide further insight into the modes of AC regulation and function.<br><br>
Materials and Methods
<span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> strains and culture.
Strains were cultured according to standard procedures [28]. ts mutants were maintained at 15 °C and GFP-expressing strains in a wild-type background were maintained in a 23 °C incubator. dhc-1(or195) was outcrossed six times to the N2 Bristol wild-type strain and the or283 and or352 dhc-1 mutants were each outcrossed four times with N2. For sequencing mutant dhc-1 loci, genomic DNA was amplified as overlapping ∼1-kb fragments from the start codon to the stop codon and sequenced at the University of Oregon DNA sequencing laboratory. For double mutant constructions, the dhc-1(or195) mutation was monitored by sequencing or by assaying a restriction fragment length polymorphism caused by the mutation with Hpy188I (New England Biolabs, http://www.neb.com), following PCR amplification of the mutated region. The dylt-1(ok417) and ufd-2(tm1380) alleles were monitored by PCR amplification of genomic sequence encompassing the deletions and assaying product size by agarose gel electrophoresis.<br><br>GFP imaging.
Visualization of GFP fusion protein localization was accomplished by mounting embryos on M9 + 3% agarose pads on microscope slides covered with a coverslip. Time-lapse videos were obtained on a spinning disk Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope (Nikon Instruments, http://www.nikon.com) fitted with an ORCA-ER digital camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, http://www.hamamatsu.com) using a Nikon 60×, 1.4 NA Plan Apo oil objective lens. Videos were adjusted for contrast in ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) [76], images were adjusted for levels in Adobe Photoshop (http://www.adobe.com/).<br><br>RNAi screening.
After obtaining the <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> RNAi library from the MRC Geneservice (Cambridge, UK) [17,19], we rearrayed it into a 48-well microplate format using a liquid-handling Qiagen BioRobot 8000 (http://www.qiagen.com). <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> strains were thawed from −80 °C storage and inoculated into 1 ml of LB + 100 mg/ml ampicillin-containing 96-well growth plates (Whatman, http://www.whatman.com) and covered with microporous sealing film (USA Scientific, http://www.usascientific.com). Only 48 wells of the 96-well growth plates were filled with media, corresponding to the rearrayed <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> library. After overnight shaking incubation at 37 °C, 20 μl of the cultures were dispensed with a 24-channel electronic repeating pipette (Rainin, http://www.rainin.com) onto 48-well plates (Nunc, http://www.nuncbrand.com/) containing NGM agar, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 1 mM IPTG and allowed to dry and induce dsRNA at 37 °C overnight. The 48-well agar plates were filled with a Wheaton Unispense peristaltic pump (http://www.wheaton.com) equipped with a custom-made adaptor (University of Oregon Technical Science Administration) that allowed simultaneous filling of eight wells with the agar solution. Approximately 15 hypochlorite-synchronized L1 mutant larvae were pipetted into each well of the 48-well plates with a multichannel pipette and allowed to produce broods. Screening for F1 viability was performed by visual examination with a dissecting microscope. Phenotypes were recorded on an Excel spreadsheet (http://www.microsoft.com) and organized in a FileMaker Pro (http://www.filemaker.com) database. We qualitatively identified 295 initial positive suppressing <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> strains, for which we repeated the assay on 60-mm plates with <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> again thawed from the library (not streak purified). If the observed phenotypes reproduced, the assay was performed with three streak-purified <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> colonies, and a single isolate that again displayed the interaction was kept for further analysis.<br><br>Embryonic viability quantitation methods.
To quantitate embryonic viability we used the following procedure. Cultures of dsRNA-producing bacteria were grown overnight in LB + 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cultures (0.2 ml) were seeded onto 60-mm NGM agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 1 mM IPTG and allowed to induce dsRNAs overnight at room temperature. The L4440 control vector-containing strain was used as the bacterial lawn for the experiments shown in Figures 2A and 3B. Approximately 80 synchronized L1 larvae (obtained from hypochlorite-treated <span class="blue">worms</span>) were pipetted onto the plates and allowed to grow to young adulthood. Five gravid <span class="blue">worms</span> were transferred to prepared NGM agar plates supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 1 mM IPTG containing a small RNAi bacterial lawn produced from ∼5 μl of overnight <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> culture. After producing broods, the adult <span class="blue">worms</span> were removed and the embryos were allowed to develop for at least 24 h. Embryos and larvae were then counted immediately or after storage at 4 °C. We considered only suppressor dsRNAs that increased embryonic viability greater than 3-fold above the background viability observed with the L4440 control vector (in the dhc-1(or195)) screen to be significant enough for continued study.<br><br>Molecular biology.
We introduced a polylinker site containing six unique restriction enzyme recognition sites into the pIC26 GFP-S protein plasmid by using phosphorylated and PAGE-purified synthetic oligonucleotides [77]. Following ligation, the new plasmid was sequence verified. The modified vector, pSO26, allows the use of additional restriction enzymes and directional cloning for inserting genes of interest (Figure S2). The SpeI site was recreated at the 5′ end of the polylinker but not at the 3′ end. We amplified N2 genomic DNA or cDNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) with Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene, http://www.stratagene.com), and cloned A-tailed PCR products into either pGEM-T or pGEM-T-easy shuttle vectors (Promega, http://www.promega.com). Inserted genes were sequence verified at the University of Oregon DNA sequencing laboratory prior to cleavage and ligation to pSO26 (see Table S3 for restriction sites and primer sequences used). All of the constructs used in this study were cloned as SpeI-AsiSI or AscI-AsiSI fragments, except for the STAR-2 gene, which was amplified as a SpeI fragment and cloned into pIC26.
To construct dynein subunit dsRNA-expressing plasmids not available in the RNAi library, gene fragments were amplified from N2 genomic DNA with the following primers: F41G4.1: 5′-AAGATATCACCCAAAATGGTCCAAAACAAAG-3′ and 5′-CGGATATCTCGACTGAAGCTGGTTCTGA-3′, xbx-1: 5′-AAGATATCTACGACGATGGAAGTTTGAAG-3′ and 5′-CGGATATCCGTGCCTCTGCAGC-3′, dlc-3: 5′-AAGATATCAATTTCAGGTGGACACTGGC-3′ and 5′-CGGATATCAGCACACTTGCATCATCTGAA-3′. The PCR products were cut with EcoRV, ligated to EcoRV-digested L4440, and sequence verified.<br><br>Isolation of transgenic <span class="blue">worms</span>.
GFP fusion plasmids were bombarded into unc-119(ed3) <span class="blue">worms</span> as previously described except with the following two changes [78]. Three milligrams of gold particles were used per hepta adaptor bombardment. Also, we briefly sonicated the gold particles (prior to DNA coating and while suspended in 50% glycerol) with a Branson sonifier 450 (http://www.sonifier.com/) fitted with a small tip set to power level 1, to disrupt gold aggregates. Non-Unc <span class="blue">worms</span> were picked to new plates and allowed to produce broods, which were assayed for GFP fluorescence with a Zeiss axioskop microscope (http://www.zeiss.com/) fitted with an X-Cite 120 illumination system (EXFO life sciences, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). For each fluorescent line, 12 GFP-positive <span class="blue">worms</span> were singled to new plates to determine if the constructs were integrated or were carried as extrachromosomal arrays.<br><br>

Abstract
This study was undertaken to evaluate the role of IL-5 in eosinophil migration and in the maintenance of eosinophilia in a <span class="yellow">guinea-pig</span> model of visceral larva migrans syndrome. The results show that the infection of animals with <span class="yellow">Toxocara canis</span> induced an early increase in serum IL-5 levels that might be essential for eosinophil differentiation and proliferation and for the development of eosinophilia. When infected <span class="yellow">guinea-pigs</span> were treated with mAb anti-IL-5 (TRFK-5) given at the same time or 1 or 3 days after infection, there was a high percentage of reduction of eosinophil counts 18 days after infection. However, when the mAb was administered during the peak of eosinophilia, there was high inhibition in blood, no inhibition in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) or peritoneum and an increase in eosinophil numbers in bone marrow. Thus, a basic level of IL-5 may be essential to drive eosinophils from bone marrow to blood and tissues, and for the maintenance of eosinophilia in infected animals. We may also conclude that when eosinophils have already migrated to the lungs, TRFK-5 has no power to inhibit eosinophilia, which is also under control of local lung cells producing IL-5. In this way, only one later TRFK-5 treatment may not be sufficient to modify the lung parenchyma microenvironment, since <span class="yellow">T. canis</span> antigens had already stimulated some cell populations to produce IL-5.

In <span class="yellow">humans</span>, VLMS results from the ingestion of embryonated eggs of <span class="yellow">T. canis</span>, that eclode in the small intesfine. The infective larvae invade the mucosa, move into the liver via the portal circulation, and from there to the lungs. 2 Beaver et al., 3 who were the first to describe this syndrome, noted the intense eosinophilia which reaches more than 90% of total leucocyte counts. However, there are few studies regarding the mechanisms involved in the blood and tissue eosinophilia obseeeed in VLMS. Several investigators have suggested a direct correlation between eosinophilia and interleukin5 (IL-5) in <span class="yellow">human</span> helminth infections4'5 and in experimental animal models. 67 Inhibition of eosinophilia has been demonstrated by anti-IL-5 24 Mediators of Inflammation Vol 5 <br><br> brasiliensis, 8 $chistosoma mansoni, <span class="yellow">Toxocara canis</span>7 and <span class="yellow">Heligmosomoidespolygyrus</span>. 1 IL-5 has also been shown to support the terminal differentiation, proliferation of eosinophil precursors 11'12 and eosinophil activation. 13 Although IL-5 does not demonstrate eosinophil chemotactic activity in vivo14 there is some evidence suggesting that this cytokine may modulate a selective eosinophil accumulation at the site of inflammation. Moreover, Sehmi et a/.15 reported that IL-5 has a selective priming effect on eosinophil migratory response to nonselective chemoattractant mediators in vitro. Also, Moser et a/. 16 have demonstrated that in order to acquire the ability to transmigrate, eosinophils must be primed with IL-5, IL-3 and GM-CSF. Thus, the involvement of IL-5 in eosinophilia is not fully understood. In the present study we have used a <span class="yellow">guinea-pig</span> model of VLMS to investigate the involvement of IL-5 in eosinophil migration and in the maintenance of eosinophilia in blood, bone marrow, lung and peritoneal cavity.

Data obtained from five animals. <br><br> drastically reduced, even when determined 18 days after infection (Table 1). No inhibition of eosinophil counts was observed when the animals were inoculated with the irrelevant antibody at the time of infection (Table 1). Fig. 4 shows the comparative results of eosinophilia obtained when the antibody was given 3 days or 17 days after egg inoculation. The antibody given at 3 days after infection induced a high percentage of inhibition in eosinophil counts in all the compartments analysed 18 days after infection (Fig. 4A). However, when TRFK-5 was administered to the infected animals on day 17 post-infection (thus 1 day before sacrifice), a significant inhibition in number and percentage of eosinophils was observed only in the blood (p=0.030) (Fig. 4B). A small non-significant decrease was seen in BALF (p 0.790) and peritoneum (p= 0.222). Moreover, the number of mature eosinophils in bone marrow increased by 140% (p 0.038). As demonstrated in Fig. 4B, the behaviour of eosinotShilia in BALF was completely different from that observed in blood. Thus, to better understand the eosinophilia in the lungs of infected animals, we monitored eosinophil numbers in BALF after administration of TRFK-5 at the same time, or 1, 3, 12 or 17 days after infection. The animals were sacrificed 18 days after infection. In another group, TRFK-5 was administered 18 days post-infection and the animals were sacrificed 6 days later. When the mAb was administered at the same time or 1 or 3 days postinfection there was a significant inhibition in the number of eosinophils (Fig. 5).

However, the treatment of animals with TRFK-5 at the same time of infection, or 1 day or 3 days later ted to a complete inhibition of eosinophil infiltration in the lung parenchyma (Fig. 6C). By contrast, the mononuclear cell infiltration in the lungs was not modified. When the infected <span class="yellow">guinea-pigs</span> received TRFK-5 1 day before sacrifice (or 17 days post-infection), eosinophil infiltration in the lung parenchyma was also inhibited (Fig. 6D) but not to the same extent as observed in the group receiving TRFK-5 given at the time of infection or 3 days later. Thus, the histological determination of eosinophil infiltration in these lungs corroborates a reduction but not a sizeable inhibition of eosinophil numbers as observed in the BALF of the same infected animals, <br><br> poorly defined, although T lymphocytes and mast cells appear to be involved in eosinophilia. 9'2 IL-5, a T cell-derived factor that regulates B cell functions, is an eosinophil differentiation factor11 as well as a stimulating and survival-prolonging factor specific for eosinophils in vitro. 2 Also, several investigators have demonstrated that sTstemic eosinophilia in <span class="yellow">mice</span> infected with parasites is mediated by IL-5 produced in response to the infection. 2'22 In the present study, the i.p. administration of the TRFK-5 antibody markedly inhibited the widespread eosinophilia observed in <span class="yellow">T. canis</span>-infected <span class="yellow">guinea-pigs</span>, indicating that IL5 participated in a <span class="yellow">guinea-pig</span> model of VLMS eosinophJlia. Most of the <span class="yellow">T. canis</span> larvae which penetrated the intestinal wall had migrated into the liver within 72h after inoculation as demonstrated here and elsewhere. 2 It is apparently during this interval that the worm provides the signals to cytokine-producing cells, which in turn trigger increased serum levels of specific cytokine as demonstrated here for IL-5, 24 to 72 h after infection. The signals may be provided directly by the invading parasite or by cells in response to the parasite. The cytokine pattern that develops at this early stage, probably induced by a T-cell independent pathway, may also influence the pattern of T cell differentiation into a Th2 type, which may be responsible for the second peak of IL-5 observed in our experimental model (Fig. 3), although a second cycle of larval invasion (Fig. 2) with a rapid peak of IL-5 liberation cannot be ruled out. <br><br> Discussion The results of the present study show that in our experimental model widespread eosinophilia follows the infection of <span class="yellow">guinea-pigs</span> with second stage eggs from <span class="yellow">T. canis</span>, as also noted in <span class="yellow">humans</span> and in other experimental animals. 7'7 <span class="yellow">T. canis</span> is a potent stimulus for systemic eosinophilia, since blood, BALF, peritoneum and all tissues examined (kidney, eyes, spleen, thymus, <br><br> Thus, our results suggest that the eosinophilia against helminth larvae may be initiated by the release of IL-5 when the parasites migrate from the intestine to the liver by stimulation of specific cell populations. Then, an early release of IL-5 quickly induces eosinophil recruitment, probably first from the stored mature eosinophil pool from vascular endothelium or by the mobilization of eosinophils from extravascular sites to the blood. This fact could explain why we found increased eosinophils first in blood and later in other compartments. The early IL-5 release may also serve as a signal for eosinophil differentiation and maturation in bone marrow. The time <br><br> inteeeal observed between the first peak of IL-5 release and the increase of eosinophils in blood coincides with that reported to be necessary for eosinophil differentiation and maturation in vitro. 12Increased eosinophil production and liberation into blood and other tissues occurs Mediators of Inflammation Vol 5 <br><br> 1996 <br><br> 29 <br><br> L.

The animals were sacrificed 18 days after infection. Note the intense eosinophil infiltration into the lung in A and B, the inhibition of eosinophils in C and the reduction of eosinophils in D. <br><br> thereafter. Thus, early and later IL-5 release provides a necessary level of this cytokine, which is involved in the maintenance of eosinophilia. We may assume that the inhibition of the first peak of IL-5 release by TRFK-5 does not permit the subsequent T cell stimulation and differentiation. This may explain the long-lasting effect of TRFK5 treatment observed here and also reported by others. 8 In agreement with our results, there is an important observation of Svetic et al. 24 showing that a specific and highly reproducible IL-5 gene expression pattern is detectable in Peyer's patches by 6 to 12h after <span class="yellow">Heligmosomoides polygyrus</span> infection. The early increase in IL-5 gene expression after infection was probably T cell-independent, inasmuch as it was obseeeed in Peyer's patches of congenitally athymic <span class="yellow">mice</span> and of conventional <span class="yellow">mice</span> treated with anti-CD4 30 Mediators of Inflammation Vol 5 <br><br> and anti-CD8 mAb. Moreover, Kusama eta/. 25 have observed two peaks of eosinophilia in normal and athymic <span class="yellow">mice</span>, and suggested that IL-5 observed in the first peak was produced by cells other than CD4 T cells, since anti-CD4 and anti-CD3 mAb reduced only the second peak of eosinophilia in normal <span class="yellow">mice</span> and slightly reduced the first peak of eosinophilia in both normal and nu/nu <span class="yellow">mice</span>. The local lung cells producing IL-5 may also help us to explain the reason why 12, 17 or 18 days post-infection TRFK-5 treatment only partially inhibits, or does not inhibit eosinophil infiltration into the lungs, as demonstrated in Figs 5 and 6. We may suggest that when eosinophils have already migrated to the lungs, TRFK-5 has no power to inhibit eosinophilia, which is also under control of local lung cells producing IL-5. In this way, only one later TRFK<br><br> 1996 <br><br> IL-5 drives eosinophils in <span class="yellow">guinea-pig</span> <br><br> 5 treatment may not be sufficient to modify the lung parenchyma microenvironment, since <span class="yellow">T. canis</span> antigens have already stimulated some cell populations to produce IL-5, as demonstrated by Kusama et aL25These results suggest that eosinophilia in lungs is under the control of different factors when compared to that observed in blood and the peritoneal cavity. One of the most important results obtained here was the inhibition of circulating eosinophil numbers by the different mAb treatments, even when the antibody was given at the peak of blood eosinophilia, which was accompanied by an increase of mature eosinophils in bone marrow. This suggests that IL-5, apart from being required for the terminal differentiation of eosinophils in bone marrow, 26 is also likely to drive eosinophils from the bone marrow to the blood and then to the tissues, probably by upregulating VLA-4 expression in eosinophils. Moser et aL have demonstrated that in order to acquire the ability to transmigrate, eosinophils must be primed with cytokines such as IL-5, IL-3 or GM-CSF for expression of adhesion molecules such as VI-4. Recently, Pretolani et al. 27 have indeed shown that an anti-VLA-4 antibody suppresses eosinophil recruitment to lung in the <span class="yellow">guinea-pig</span> and, as a consequence, inhibits the accompanying bronchopulmonary hyperresponsiveness. <br><br> tant in protective immunity to a gastrointestinal nematode infection in <span class="yellow">mice</span>.

Abstract
Differential transcription in <span class="yellow">Ascaris suum</span> was investigated using a genomic-bioinformatic approach. A cDNA archive enriched for molecules in the infective third-stage larva (L3) of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> was constructed by suppressive-subtractive hybridization (SSH), and a subset of cDNAs from 3075 clones subjected to microarray analysis using cDNA probes derived from RNA from different developmental stages of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span>. The cDNAs (n = 498) shown by microarray analysis to be enriched in the L3 were sequenced and subjected to bioinformatic analyses using a semi-automated pipeline (ESTExplorer). Using gene ontology (GO), 235 of these molecules were assigned to ‘biological process’ (n = 68), ‘cellular component’ (n = 50), or ‘molecular function’ (n = 117). Of the 91 clusters assembled, 56 molecules (61.5%) had homologues/orthologues in the free-living nematodes <span class="yellow">Caenorhabditis elegans</span> and <span class="yellow">C. briggsae</span> and/or other organisms, whereas 35 (38.5%) had no significant similarity to any sequences available in current gene databases. Transcripts encoding protein kinases, protein phosphatases (and their precursors), and enolases were abundantly represented in the L3 of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span>, as were molecules involved in cellular processes, such as ubiquitination and proteasome function, gene transcription, protein–protein interactions, and function. In silico analyses inferred the <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> orthologues/homologues (n = 50) to be involved in apoptosis and insulin signaling (2%), ATP synthesis (2%), carbon metabolism (6%), fatty acid biosynthesis (2%), gap junction (2%), glucose metabolism (6%), or porphyrin metabolism (2%), although 34 (68%) of them could not be mapped to a specific metabolic pathway. Small numbers of these 50 molecules were predicted to be secreted (10%), anchored (2%), and/or transmembrane (12%) proteins. Functionally, 17 (34%) of them were predicted to be associated with (non-wild-type) RNAi phenotypes in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>, the majority being embryonic lethality (Emb) (13 types; 58.8%), larval arrest (Lva) (23.5%) and larval lethality (Lvl) (47%). A genetic interaction network was predicted for these 17 <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> orthologues, revealing highly significant interactions for nine molecules associated with embryonic and larval development (66.9%), information storage and processing (5.1%), cellular processing and signaling (15.2%), metabolism (6.1%), and unknown function (6.7%). The potential roles of these molecules in development are discussed in relation to the known roles of their homologues/orthologues in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> and some other nematodes. The results of the present study provide a basis for future functional genomic studies to elucidate molecular aspects governing larval developmental processes in <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> and/or the transition to parasitism.<br><br>Introduction
Parasitic nematodes are of major socio-economic importance in animals. For example, hundreds of millions of <span class="yellow">people</span> are infected with geohelminths (soil-transmitted worms), such as blood-feeding hookworms <span class="yellow">Ancylostoma duodenale</span> and/or <span class="yellow">Necator americanus</span>, <span class="yellow">Trichuris trichiura</span> and Ascaris spp. [1], causing serious adverse effects on <span class="yellow">human</span> health, particularly in <span class="yellow">children</span>. Similarly, parasitic nematodes of livestock, such as <span class="yellow">pigs</span>, also cause substantial economic losses due to subclinical and clinical diseases, with billions of dollars spent annually on the treatment and control of gastro-intestinal nematodes. In addition to the socioeconomic impact that these parasites have, there is potential for the emergence of resistance in them against all of the main classes of (nematocidal) compounds used to treat the diseases they cause [2]–[5]. Therefore, there is a significant need to work toward discovering new compounds to control these parasites. Gaining an improved understanding of the molecular basis of parasite development provides such an avenue.
Compared with the free-living nematode <span class="yellow">Caenorhabditis elegans</span>, there is very little information on fundamental molecular aspects of development in parasitic nematodes [6]–[8]. Since the genome sequence of <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> was published in 1998 [9], many aspects of the molecular biology of this nematode have been elucidated. For instance, microarray analyses have been used to examine developmental and gender-enriched gene expression [10],[11], and the functions of more than 96% of the <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> genes have been assessed by double-stranded RNA interference (RNAi, or gene silencing; [12]) [13]–[18]. Comparative analyses of genetic data sets have shown that parasitic nematodes usually share ∼50–70% of genes with <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> (e.g., [19],[20]). There is similarity in other features (such as basic body plan and moulting) between <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> and parasitic nematodes, suggesting that some molecular pathways are relatively conserved [8],[21]. Understanding the pathways linked to basic nematode biology and development could have important implications for finding new ways of disrupting these pathways and thus facilitate the identification of new drug targets.
Despite the advances in genomic technologies [7], [22]–[29] and the study of <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>, there is a paucity of information on the genomics of parasitic nematodes of animals, particularly in relation to development. Also considering the major socioeconomic impact of Ascaris and ascariasis in <span class="yellow">humans</span> and <span class="yellow">pigs</span> [30]–[32], several characteristics, including the large size of the adult worm (providing the opportunity of investigating individual organ systems and tissues), the ability to maintain Ascaris in the <span class="yellow">pig</span>, store eggs and culture larvae in vitro for relatively long periods of time (months to years) [32] as well as the discovery that RNAi achieves “cross-species” gene silencing for a selected number of genes [33],[34] and the imminent genome sequence (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/Helminths/) all indicate that Ascaris could serve as a powerful model system for investigating reproductive and developmental processes in nematodes.
In the present study, Ascaris from <span class="yellow">pigs</span> was used to study molecules abundantly transcribed in the infective third-stage larva (L3). Following the oral ingestion of Ascaris eggs by the host (<span class="yellow">human</span> or <span class="yellow">pig</span>), L3s are released and then invade/penetrate predominantly the caecal wall [35] to then undergo hepato-pulmonary migration, after which ultimately the adult females and males establish and develop in the small intestine [36],[37]. The molecular mechanisms linked to host invasion and parasite development are largely unknown. Here, we constructed an L3-enriched cDNA library using the method of suppressive-subtractive hybridization (SSH), explored transcription of a representative subset of molecules by microarray analysis and conducted bioinformatic analyses to characterize these molecules, map them to biochemical pathways and predict genetic interactions based on comparisons with <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> and/or other organisms.<br><br>Materials and Methods
Production of Different Developmental Stages of Ascaris
Experimental <span class="yellow">pigs</span> (8–12 weeks of age) were purchased from and maintained in the Experimental Animal Center of South China Agricultural University. These <span class="yellow">pigs</span> were treated humanely, according to the Animal Ethics procedures and guidelines of the People's Republic of China. Adult <span class="red">worms</span> (males and females) of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> were collected from the small intestines of <span class="yellow">pigs</span> from an abattoir in Shenzhen, China. Infective eggs and infective L3s of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> were produced according to the methods described previously [38]. In brief, eggs from the uteri of adult females of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> were collected and incubated at 28°C for 28 days to allow them to develop to infective eggs (containing infective L3s). To obtain pure infective L3s, 7.5% v/v sodium hypochlorite was used to treat the larvated eggs at 37°C overnight and then the eggs were shaken with glass-beads; then, the exsheathed L3s and shells were separated by density gradient centrifugation using lymphocyte separating medium (LSM) [38]. Following the experimental infection of helminth-free <span class="yellow">pigs</span> with infective Ascaris eggs as described previously [39], the L3s from livers and in lungs as well as L4s in intestines were isolated according to an established method [40]. All parasite materials were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to storage at −70°C.<br><br>Construction of the cDNA Library by Subtractive-Suppressive Hybridization (SSH)
Total RNA was isolated from adult females and males, different larval stages or eggs of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> using TriPure reagent (Roche) as recommended by the manufacturer. Equal amounts of total RNA from each stage or sex were pooled. The mRNA was isolated using the Oligotex mRNA Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's protocol. SSH was carried out using the PCR-Select cDNA Subtraction kit (Clontech), according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, cDNA synthesized from mRNAs from infective L3s was subtracted against cDNA synthesized from the pooled mRNA from all other stages included herein. The SSH library was constructed using infective L3s as the tester and pooled cDNAs from all other stages as the driver. The effectiveness of this subtraction process has already been demonstrated in previous studies [41],[42]. The cDNA obtained following SSH was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy plasmid vector (Promega) and competent <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span> (JM109) transformed. Positive clones, picked randomly (based on blue/white selection), were grown overnight in Luria Bertani (LB) medium (shaking, 37°C). Individual inserts were PCR-amplified using “nested primers” 1 and 2R from the Subtraction kit (Clontech) and examined by agarose electrophoresis.<br><br>Preparation of Microarray Slides
Clones (n = 3075) from the subtracted library were picked and cultured overnight in LB containing ampicillin (1000 IU/ml) in sealed 96-well blocks. Five µl of culture suspension from each well were transferred into individual wells thermocycling (96-well) plates and the inserts PCR-amplified using primers 1 and 2R. Following a 10 min denaturation step at 94°C, the amplification proceeded for 25 cycles of 10 s at 94°C, 30 s at 68°C and 1.5 min at 72°C, with a final extension for 5 min at 72°C. Products were resolved in agarose gels, ethanol precipitated, re-suspended in 16 µl of “spotting solution” (Shanghai BioStar Genechip, Inc) to a final concentration of ∼500 ng per µl, before being printed on to glass slides (in duplicate) using a robotic arrayer. Sixteen blanks (using spotting solution only) and the same number of negative (irrelevant cDNAs with no relationship to Ascaris) were also printed on to slides and served as negative controls; β-actin of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> served as a positive control to assess the efficiency of labeling and hybridization. The slides were air-dried for 2 h, and cDNA in the spots were cross-linked at 254 mJ. The printed slides were stored at 4°C.<br><br>Labeling of cDNA Probes with Fluorescent Dyes, and Microarray Analysis
The cDNAs produced from total RNA from <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> eggs, infective L3s, L3s isolated from <span class="yellow">pig</span> liver or lung, fourth-stage larvae (L4s), adult males or females [as described in the section ‘Construction of the cDNA Library by Subtractive-Suppressive Hybridization (SSH)’] were labeled with cyanine dyes. Cy3 or Cy5-dCTP was incorporated into cDNA produced from 30 µg of total RNA by direct labeling in a reverse transcription reaction using an oligo (dT) primer. Labeled cDNA was purified using DyeEx columns (Qiagen).
Microarray slides were incubated with a pre-hybridization solution [5×SSC, 1% <span class="yellow">bovine</span> serum albumin (BSA), 0.1% sodium dodecyl-sulphate (SDS)] for 6 h at 42°C. After pre-hybridization, the microarray slides were incubated with ‘pooled’ Cy3 and Cy5-labeled probes in hybridization solution (5×SSC, 1% BSA, 0.1% SDS), in the dark at 42°C for 18 h, and then washed in solution I (1×SSC, 0.2% SDS) for 10 min, followed by solution II (0.1×SSC, 0.2% SDS) for 10 min at 60°C, according to the protocols provided by Shanghai BioStar Genechip, Inc. A “dye flip” was carried out to control for any bias in hybridization signal between the Cy-labeled cDNA probes (produced for two distinct mRNA populations). The slides were dried and scanned (ScanArray 4000 scanner) using image acquisition software (Shanghai BioStar Genechip Inc.) and a range of laser power and photo-multiplier tube intensities. The mean hybridization signal (derived from four replicates of the same array) were corrected for background, normalized [43], log2-transformed and then subjected to statistical analysis employing the students t-test in a spreadsheet (Excel, Microsoft, USA). The microarray data were analysed for differential cDNA hybridization (>2.0-fold to 114.3-fold) between L3 and each of the other stages (eggs, lung and liver L3s, L4, adult female and adult male).<br><br>Verification of Differential Hybridization by Reverse Transcription-Coupled Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Analysis
For a subset (n = 17) of representative ESTs (rESTs), RT-PCR was used to verify the differential transcription recorded by microarray analysis. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from total RNA (separately) from each stage or sex of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> using reverse transcriptase (Superscript III, Invitrogen). Briefly, 5 µg of total RNA were added to 14 µl of H2O and 1 µl of oligo d(T)n = 12–18 primer (0.5 µg/µl), heated to 70 °C for 10 min and chilled on ice. First- and second-strand cDNAs were synthesized via the addition of 4 µl of first-strand cDNA buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 375 mM KCl and 15 mM MgCl2), 2 µl of 0.1 M dithiothreitol, and 1 µl of 10 mM of each dNTP, followed by an incubation at 25 °C (10 min), 42 °C (50 min) and 70 °C (15 min). One-tenth of each double-stranded cDNA produced was then used as a template in the PCR. The transcripts were amplified from individual cDNAs by PCR using oligonucleotide primers (sequences available upon request) designed to each EST. The PCR amplification of a portion (209 bp) of the β-actin gene (accession no. BI594141) using forward primer (5′-CTCGAAACAAGAATACGATG-3′) and reverse primer (5′- ACATGTGCCGTTGTATGATG-3′), previously determined to be present in all developmental stages and both sexes of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> [44], served as a positive control. Samples without template (no-DNA controls) were included in each PCR run. The following cycling conditions were employed: one cycle at 94 °C (5 min), 94 °C (30 s), 60 °C (30 s) and 72 °C (30 s) for 30 cycles, followed by a final extension of 70 °C (7 min). Following the PCR, 5 µl of individual amplicons were resolved in ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels (2%) and then photographed upon transillumination. The relative band intensities were analyzed using UVIsoft Image Acquisition and Analysis software (UVITEC). The specificity and identity of individual amplicons were confirmed by direct sequencing using the same primers (separately) as employed for their amplification.<br><br>Sequencing and Bioinformatics Analyses
Clones from the SSH cDNA library with increased hybridization in microarray analysis to the infective L3 compared with other stages were sequenced using standard technology [45]. The nucleotide sequences have been deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers ES290984-ES291074. Following the processing of the sequences (i.e., removal of vector sequences, quality assurance and clustering), contigs or singletons from individual clusters were subjected to BLASTx (NCBI: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and BLASTn (EMBL-EBI Parasite Genome Blast Server: www.ebi.ac.uk) analysis to identify putative homologues in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>, other nematodes and other organisms (e-value of ≤1e-05). Peptides inferred from ESTs were classified functionally using Interproscan (available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/InterProScan/) employing the default search parameters. WormBase (www.wormbase.org) was interrogated extensively for relevant information on <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> homologues/orthologues, including RNAi phenotypic, transcriptomic, proteomic and interactomic data. ESTs with homologues/orthologues in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> and other nematodes were also subjected to analysis employing the KEGG Orthology-Based Annotation System (KOBAS) (www.kobas.cbi.pku.edu.cn), which predicts the biochemical pathways in which molecules are involved. The open reading frames (ORFs) inferred from selected ESTs with orthologues in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> were also subjected to “secretome analysis” using the program SignalP v.2.0 www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/), employing both the neural network and hidden Markov models to predict signal peptides and/or anchors [46]–[48]. Also, transmembrane domains were predicted using the program TMHMM (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/; [49]–[51]), and subcellular localization inferred employing the program WoLF PSORT (http://wolfpsort.org/; [52]).
The method established by Zhong and Sternberg [53] was used to predict the interactions for <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> orthologues of the L3-enriched molecules from Ascaris. In brief, interaction, phenotypic, expression and gene ontology data from <span class="yellow">fruitfly</span>, <span class="yellow">yeast</span>, <span class="yellow">mouse</span> and <span class="yellow">human</span> were integrated using a naïve Bayesian model to predict genetic interactions among <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> genes ([45],[53]; Zhong and Sternberg, unpublished). The predicted networks resulting from the analyses were saved in a graphic display file (gdf) format and examined using the graph exploration system available at http://graphexploration.cond.org/. Images were labeled and saved in the joint photographic experts group (jpeg) format.<br><br>
Results
To identify molecules transcribed abundantly in the L3 of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span>, an enriched cDNA library was constructed by SSH. From a total of 3075 clones from this library, 2921 (95%) were shown to contain an insert (which could be amplified by PCR). From 2671 (92%) of these clones, amplicons representing single bands of ∼400 to 600 bp in size were produced. These latter amplicons were arrayed (in duplicate) on to slides and then hybridized with Cy3-labeled L3-cDNA or with Cy5-labeled cDNA from eggs, liver/lung L3s, L4s, adult female or adult male of Ascaris. Dye flip was conducted to verify the hybridization data. Of the 2671 (duplicate) spots, 1526 had a significant difference in hybridization between infective L3 cDNA and cDNAs from all other stages or sexes of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span>, of which 515 had a >2.0-fold increased hybridization for the L3.
In order to independently verify the hybridization results in the microarray, a PCR-based analysis of a selected subset (n = 17) clones was conducted using specific primer pairs. Having verified the specificity and identity of individual amplicons by sequencing, PCR results were reproducible (based on multiple runs on different days) and ∼94% (16 of 17) concordant with those of the microarray analysis (not shown). There was complete concordance for representative clones associated with a differential signal of ≥3.0-fold in the microarray.
The clones linked to the 515 spots representing increased transcription (>2.0-fold) in infective L3 compared with the other developmental stages or sexes included were subjected to sequencing. The 498 sequences (length: 550±115 bp) determined were then subjected to detailed bioinformatic analyses. There were 91 unique clusters (accession numbers ES290984-ES291074), of which 55 were singletons (sequences determined once). Of 56 molecules (61.5%) with significant similarity to sequences other than <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> in the databases interrogated, 50 (54.9%) had <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> or <span class="yellow">C. briggsae</span> homologues, and six had similarity to ESTs already sequenced from ascaridoid and/or other parasitic nematodes, and/or other organisms (Table 1). A significant proportion (38.4%) did not have any similarity in sequence to any organisms for which data are presently available. Comparative analysis specifically against <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> EST data sets (n∼42,000) available in public databases confirmed independently that the majority of molecules (>60%) were present exclusively in the infective L3 stage or were orphans.
As gene ontology (GO) provides a hierarchy that unifies the descriptions of biological, cellular and molecular functions [54], this approach was employed to predict the classification and gene function of molecules enriched in infective L3 of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span>. A summary of the GO categories of these molecules is displayed in Fig. 1. Of the 91 contigs, 32 (35%) could be functionally assigned to ‘biological process’ (n = 38), ‘cellular component’ (n = 17) and ‘molecular function’ (n = 64). The most common subcategories were gluconeogenesis (13%) and metabolic process (13%) within ‘biological process’, extracellular region (24%) within ‘cellular component’, and catalytic activity (11%) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity (8%) within ‘molecular function’ (Table S1).
A focused KOBAS analysis inferred the 50 <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> orthologues/homologues to be involved in apoptosis and insulin signaling (2%), ATP synthesis (2%), carbon metabolism (6%), fatty acid biosynthesis (2%), gap junction (2%), glucose metabolism (6%) or porphyrin metabolism (2%), although 34 (68%) of them could not be mapped to a specific metabolic pathway (Table 2). Of these 50 molecules, small numbers were predicted to be secreted (10%), anchored (2%) and/or transmembrane (12%) proteins (Table 2). Functionally, 17 (34%) of the 50 molecules were associated with (non-wild-type) RNAi phenotypes in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>, the majority displaying embryonic lethality (Emb) (13 types; 58.8%), larval arrest (Lva) (23.5%) and larval lethality (Lvl) (47%) (Table 2).
Extending this analysis, a relatively complex genetic interaction network was predicted for the 17 <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> orthologues (i.e., with non-wild-type RNAi phenotypes) (see Table S2). Statistically highly significant interactions were predicted for nine of the <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> genes; the top five interactors are displayed in Fig. 2. The gene ontology categories for eight selected <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> genes (F33D11.10, F55A12.8, kin-2, mec-12, mup-2, pab-1, rpl-22 and T21B10.2) included: embryonic development, egg hatching, larval development and/or growth. The other categories included: positive regulation of growth rate (F55A12.8, kin-2, mup-2, pab-1, rpl-22 and T21B10.2) and gamete generation and locomotory behaviour (kin-2, mup-2, pab-1 and F55A12.8, kin-2, mup-2, respectively). The <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> homologue egl-3 was predicted to be involved in proteolysis (see www.wormbase.org). All nine <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> orthologues were predicted to interact directly with a total of 296 (range: 5–75) other genes and, in particular, a direct genetic interaction was predicted between pab-1 and T21B10.2 (Fig. 2). The 296 interactors were associated with embryonic and larval development (n = 198; 66.9%), information storage and processing (n = 15; 5.1%), cellular processes and signalling (n = 45; 15.2%) and metabolism (n = 18; 6.1%); the precise function of some of the interactors (n = 20; 6.7%) is presently unknown (Table S2).<br><br>Discussion
The present study investigated transcripts in infective L3s of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> using a genomic-bioinformatic platform. The focus was on comparisons with <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> homologues/orthologues, because the entire genome sequence of this nematode is known [9] and because there is a wealth of information on the localization and functionality of its molecules (www.wormbase.org; http://elegans.bcgsc.bc.ca/knockout.shtml). The functions of most genes in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> have been assessed using RNAi (e.g., [14],[15],[17],[55],[56]) in the hermaphroditic stage, whereas there is a paucity of functional information available for Ascaris and other parasitic nematodes of animals [57],[58].
Following the microarray analysis of >2500 ESTs from the SSH library, 498 cDNAs inferred to be enriched in the L3, based on hybridization signal, were sequenced and subjected to comprehensive in silico analyses. Of the 91 clusters of molecules categorized, 50 (54.9%) had <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> homologues/orthologues with loss-of-function phenotypes could be mapped to key pathways. The statistically significant genetic interactions predicted for 9 of the 50 <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> orthologues [namely egl-3, F33D11.10, F55A12.8, kin-2, mec-12, mup-2, pab-1, rpl-22 and T21B10.2 ( = enol-1)] and the interaction network included genes encoding kinases, alpha-tubulins, enolases, troponin and other named and unnamed proteins. Eight of these molecules (enol-1, pab-1, F33D11.10, rpl-22, F55A12.8 mec-12, mup-2 and kin-2) have known or predicted roles in embryonic and larval growth and development, gamete generation, locomotory behaviour or other biological processes in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> (see www.wormbase.org).
The enolase encoded by enol-1 is predicted to play a role in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis (cf. [59]). Since glucose is the main source for ATP production, the alteration in these key glycolytic enzymes may lead to cellular dysfunction, such as impaired ion-motive ATPase required to maintain potential gradients, operate pumps and maintain membrane lipid asymmetry [60]. Bioinformatic analysis for transmembrane helices (TMHMM) and peptide signal sequences (SignalP) predicted ENOL-1 to be a non-secreted protein localized to the cytoplasm (cf. Table 2). Nonetheless, enolases are often detected in the excretory/secretory (ES) products of parasitic helminths, including adult <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> [61], and appear to play a role in the triggering of nitric oxide production by host cells. The enol-1 orthologue of <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> has been predicted to interact specifically with the polyadenylate binding protein gene, pab-1, inferred to be involved in coordinated gene transcription and expression during normal larval development [16]. Poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) are recognized to be central to the regulation of mRNA translation and stability [62]. Present evidence suggests that the expression of PAB-1 is regulated by an oligo-pyrimidine tract in response to cell growth and relates to coordinated growth regulation in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> [62]. Furthermore, gene silencing of pab-1 and its selected interactors (see Fig. 2) leads to embryonic lethal (Emb), slow growth (Slo) and sterile progeny (Stp) phenotypes (see www.wormbase.org).
Another gene (F33D11.10; EST code 4F10; see Table 2) which encodes an ATP-dependent RNA helicase and is associated with embryonic lethal (Emb) and larval lethal (Lvl) RNAi phenotypes, was shown to be highly transcribed in infective L3s of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span>. Helicases are involved in a variety of RNA metabolic processes, including translation initiation, pre-mRNA splicing, pre-rRNA processing, rRNA maturation and RNA degradation [63], and are crucial for life cycle progression, sex determination and early embryogenesis in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> [60]. The high transcription levels of a homologue/orthologue in the L3 of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> might suggest a similar role in this ascaridoid. Similarly, the coordination of the expression of a large number of genes is required for normal growth and cell proliferation during larval development. The high transcription level for the ribosomal protein gene homologue rpl-22 (large subunit family member; EST code 26G12, see Table 2) in the infective L3 of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> compared with other developmental stages is likely to reflect the substantial rate of cell growth in this stage [64].
The gene (F55A12.8, EST code 4G11; see Table 2) encoding an acetyl-transferase with a putative ATPase domain, shown to be enriched in the L3 of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span>, was predicted to interact with 75 other genes all involved in energy production and/or RNA processing (see Table S2). Several molecules involved in ATP synthesis and mitochondrial pathways (e.g., cytochrome oxidase c subunits 1, 2 and 3, ADP/ATP translocases, NADH dehydrogenases, ATPases and ATP synthetases) have been reported previously to be highly represented in the L3 stage of <span class="yellow">Anisakis simplex</span> [65], thus supporting the proposal that substantial energy is required for larval development as well as the transition from the free-living to the parasitic stage and the invasion of the host. There is also likely to be a substantial energy requirement for muscle contraction linked to larval motility in <span class="yellow">A. suum</span>, as the L3s penetrate the caecal wall in the porcine host, before undergoing hepato-pulmonary migration [35]. Accordingly, genes encoding a specialized tubulin expressed in mechanoreceptors (mec-12, EST code 13E09) and a troponin (mup-2, EST code 01G03; see Table 2), both predicted to interact with a total number of 32 tubulin- and myosin-encoding genes, also supported a link to extensive muscle contraction and motility in <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> L3s. Also, neuroactive peptides are required to regulate the responsiveness of nematode larvae to mechanical stimuli [66]. A homologue encoded by egl-3 was shown to be highly transcribed in the L3 of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span>; EGL-3 is predicted to be a pro-hormone convertase involved in the maturation of neuropeptides and could be associated with mechano-sensory responses and touch sensitivity linked to the host invasion.
A regulatory subunit of a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (kin-2, EST code 22H01; see Table 2) was predicted to interact with 72 other genes all involved in diverse cellular processes, such as nuclear trafficking, and DNA replication and repair (see Table S2). Based on gene ontology terms, kin-2 is implicated in gamete generation, growth, larval development, post-embryonic body morphogenesis, signal transduction and/or protein amino acid phosphorylation (see Table S2). Gene silencing of kin-2 in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> leads to phenotypes, such as larval lethal (Lvl), larval arrest (Lva), body morphology defect (Bmd), dumpy (Dpy), uncoordinated (Unc) and sterile progeny (Stp) (www.wormbase.org), suggesting that its homologue in <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> is central to larval maturation. The KOBAS analysis predicted the protein KIN-2 to be involved in the insulin-signaling pathway, previously implicated in controlling the exit from dauer in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> and the activation of L3s of the <span class="yellow">canine hookworm</span>, <span class="yellow">Ancylostoma caninum</span>, following exsheathment [67]. In a recent study, Brand and Hawdon [68] were able to inhibit (with a phosphoinositide-3-OH-kinase inhibitor) the activation of infective L3s of both of the hookworms <span class="yellow">Ancylostoma caninum</span> and <span class="yellow">Ancylostoma ceylanicum</span> via the insulin signaling pathway, thus lending some credence to the hypothesis that this pathway plays an critical role in regulating the transition from the free-living to the parasitic stage [68]. Recently, it has been proposed that transcriptional and feeding responses to serum-stimulation in <span class="yellow">Ancylostoma caninum</span> are regulated by parallel systems, with the insulin signaling pathway playing a significant role in the ‘resumption of feeding’ in activated larvae [69].
Protein kinases are also likely to be involved in pathways linked to sexual maturation in developing larvae. As already proposed for adult stages of <span class="yellow">H. contortus</span> [45], the protein kinase gene cdk-1 is predicted to play a pivotal role in the germline, oogenesis and spermiogenesis pathways of this parasitic nematode. Other protein kinases, such as PEPCK, and phosphatases, were shown herein to be transcribed at high levels in the L3 stage compared with other developmental stages of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> (see Table 2), which is in accordance to findings reported recently for <span class="yellow">Anisakis simplex</span> [65]. Due to their major regulatory effects in eukaryotic signaling events and regulatory and sensory functions, protein kinases have been considered interesting targets for anti-parasitic drugs [70].
In conclusion, this study has given some interesting insights into early molecular processes in the L3 of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span>. Approximately 60% of the transcripts enriched in the L3 stage of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> have homologues/orthologues in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>. The bioinformatic analyses of selected molecules suggest that a complex genetic network regulates or controls larval growth and development in <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> L3s, and some of these might be involved in or regulate the switch from the free-living to the parasitic stage. Some caution is warranted in drawing conclusions regarding molecular mechanisms regulating the transition to parasitism in parasitic nematodes from information on <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>, as latter is a free-living nematode. Also, while the method of data integration is essential for the reliable prediction of genetic interactions, it might limit the capacity of the approach somewhat to infer nematode-specific interactions. As additional datasets of genes and gene functions become available for various parasitic nematodes, more informed inferences can be made regarding the functions of nematode-specific genes, particularly those involved in the transition to parasitism. The imminent genome sequence of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/Helminths/) should all assist in this endeavour. Also, functional analysis of selected molecules representing selected ESTs identified herein, utilizing gene silencing approaches established recently [33],[34], could provide some insights into developmental processes in Ascaris and related ascaridoid nematodes and provide avenues for the development of novel approaches for their control.<br><br>Supporting Information<br><br>
<h3>pmcA335194</h3>The <span class="yellow">Caenorhabditis elegans</span> genome contains monomorphic minisatellites and simple sequences.
Abstract
Many species have been shown to contain tandemly repeated short sequence DNA known as minisatellites and simple sequence motifs. Due to allelic variation in the copy number of the repeat unit these loci are usually highly polymorphic. Here we demonstrate the presence of sequences in the genome of the nematode <span class="yellow">Caenorhabditis elegans</span> which are homologous to two sets of short sequence DNA. However, when two independent strains were compared no polymorphism for these sequences could be detected.Images<br><br><br><br><br><br>

Due to allelic variation in the copy number of the repeat unit these loci are usually highly polymorphic. Here we demonstrate the presence of sequences in the genome of the nematode <span class="yellow">Caenorhabditis elegans</span> which are homologous to two sets of short sequence DNA. However, when two independent strains were compared no polymorphism for these sequences could be detected. <br><br> INTRODUCTION <br><br> The genome of many species, including lower organisms, contain minisatellite sequences and so-called simple sequence motifs (1,2,3). Due to extensive variation in the number of repeat units, many of these loci have been shown useful as polymorphic markers, e.g. for genetic linkage studies and identification purposes. <br><br> Here we demonstrate that the genome of the nematode <span class="yellow">Caenorhabditis elegans</span> contains sequences that are homologous to the minisatellite core sequence 33.6 (1) and to the simple sequence motif (AGC)n. Surprisingly, these sequences did not display polymorphism when two independent <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> strains, Bristol and Bergerac, were compared. <br><br> MATERIALS AND METHODS Genomic DNA from nematodes <br><br> Genomic DNA was isolated according to standard procedures from the two strains Bergerac (BO) and Bristol (strain N2). These strains are derived from two different individual <span class="red">worms</span> isolated in France and England, respectively. Southern blotting <br><br> Genomic DNA digests (5 Ag) were separated in a 1 % agarose gel in 1 x TAE (40 mM Tris.HCl, pH 7.4/20 mM sodium acetate/I mM NaEDTA) by electrophoresis at 75 V for 16 h. Separation patterns were transferred to Zetaprobe membrane (BIORAD) in 0.4 N NaOH, 0.6 M NaCl in a vacu-blot apparatus (LKB) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The minisatellite and simple sequence probes used were prepared essentially as described (5). The Tcl probe is a plasmid containing an insert of the transposable element Tcl (4). All probes were labelled by random-priming. Hybridization was performed for 12 h in 7 % SDS, 0.5 M phosphate buffer, 1 mM Na2EDTA at 650C. Blots were washed twice in 2.5 x SSC at 650C and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film with intensifying screens. Exposure times are indicated in Fig. 1. <br><br> ( IRL Press <br><br> Nucleic Acids Research <br><br> Volume 17 Number 23 1989 <br><br> 9527 <br><br> Nucleic Acids Research <br><br> <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> <br><br> N      0$       8 <br><br> _ _ <br><br> :  , s , ..e :*. ,~ :::::<br><br> . 4i <br><br> .t_:  -::?J?.: <br><br> i-  <br><br> .a <br><br> E?:< . :: y : <br><br> *01 <br><br> 4?j* <br><br> .-I <br><br> kb - 27 <br><br> - 9A - <br><br> : .::....... <br><br> Mi ....  - 4v3 <br><br> IC .3 <br><br> If.0r <br><br> MW <br><br> !5 c6 <br><br> I <br><br> " R  1d~ ! ;,<br><br> Figure 1.

The latter probe contains a member of the Tcl family of transposable elements which is present in different copy numbers in the two different strains (4). The hybridization patterns of probes 33.6 and (AGC)n obtained after Hae Im and Rsa I digestion and the differences in intensities of the hybridizing bands is reminiscent of DNA-fingerprint patterns obtained with these probes in other species (1,2,3). However, identical hybridization patterns for the two strains with the three enzymes tested indicated that in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> these sequences are monomorphic (Fig. 1). Based on the number of hybridizing bands we estimate the <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> genome to contain about 30 33.6 homologous loci and about 20 (AGC)n homologous loci. <br><br> Rehybridization of the same blot with a Tcl probe revealed extensive RFLPs due to the different copy number of the transposon in the two strains, a phenomenon which has been described previously by others (4). <br><br> DISCUSSION <br><br> The findings presented in this paper indicate that polymorphism of minisatellite sequences and simple sequence motifs, is not a general phenomenon in animal species. So far, only some species of whales have displayed similar high levels of monomorphism (6). In other species thus far tested both minisatellites and simple sequences display high to very high levels of polymorphism. It should be noted, however, that at least in <span class="yellow">humans</span>, a substantial part of the minisatellites detected by core probes also displays high levels of monomorphism as analysed by cloning (1) or by two-dimensional DNA fingerprinting (5). <br><br> The fact that nematodes are hermaphrodites, and thus inbred, might be a contributing factor to the observed lack of polymorphism. However, the high levels of polymorphism detected by the Tcl probe do not indicate a general absence of events causing genetic variation. Indeed, Eide and Anderson (7) showed that tandemly repeated duplications in the unc-54 gene of <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> revert at high frequencies. Since in all cases the revertants had the normal genomic configuration this suggests that unequal crossing-over does occur in the nematode. <br><br> A more likely explanation for the monomorphic nature of the sequences detected with 33.6 and (AGC)n in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> is selection against sequence variants at these loci. This might be the result of the presence of a particular subset of minisatellites and/or simple sequences at sites in the genome of this organism, e.g. in coding sequences, in which variation in copy number of repeat units cannot be tolerated. An example of such a coding sequence could be the High Mobility Group proteins which usually have stretches of identical (acidic) amino acids (2,8). An interesting observation in this respect is the demonstration of the absence of any protein polymorphisms in electrophoretic comparisons for 24 different enzymes between the Bristol and Bergerac strains (9). An important step in understanding this phenomenon will therefore be the isolation and analysis of individual homologous minisatellite and simple sequence loci from a genomic library of <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>. <br><br> REFERENCES <br><br> 1.
