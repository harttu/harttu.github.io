The group D enterococci include three main species <span class="yellow">S. faecalis</span>, <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span>, and <span class="yellow">S. durans</span>. <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span> cause a minority of all cases of enterococcal endocarditis, in those instances in which enterococci have been speciated [3], but they have been more resistant both to penicillin and penicillin-aminoglycoside combinations than <span class="yellow">S. faecalis</span> [4,5,6]. <br><br> We describe a 64-year-old <span class="yellow">man</span> with <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span> endocarditis in whom a six-week course of ampicillin and tobramycin, followed by additional courses of penicillin and other aminoglycosides, failed to eradicate the organism from the <span class="yellow">patient</span>'s mitral valve. This case is of interest because therapeutic failure of ampicillin and tobramycin in <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span> endocarditis has not been reported previously, but might have been predicted on the basis of previous in vitro and in vivo studies [6]. Although the need for both a penicillin derivative and an aminoglycoside in the therapy of enterococcal endocarditis is widely known, it is important to distinguish between the differing efficacies of penicillin-aminoglycoside combinations for treating various species of enterococci such as <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span>. <br><br> 243 <br><br> Address reprint requests to: Judith A.

He received oral erythromycin for 14 days with transient improvement of symptoms. However, after completing therapy, symptoms reappeared and he noted a 15-pound weight loss with low-grade fever (99-100.5?F) during the two months preceding admission. There was no previous history of rheumatic or congenital heart disease. <br><br> In March 1981, the <span class="yellow">patient</span> was admitted to his community hospital where evaluation revealed a new apical systolic murmur radiating to the axilla. There were no petechiae, Janeway lesions, Osler's nodes, Roth spots, or splenomegaly. The hematocrit was 34.8 percent, WBC count 9,300 cells per cu mm with a differential count of 67 segmented forms, 9 bands, 15 lymphocytes, 7 monocytes, 1 eosinophil, and 1 basophil. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 62 mm per hour (nl < 10 mm per hour) and the serum rheumatoid factor titer was 1:320. Chest films and electrocardiogram were reportedly normal. Group D streptococci grew from three sets of blood cultures. Enterococcal endocarditis was diagnosed and he was treated with six weeks of parenteral ampicillin (12 grams per day) and tobramycin (3 mg per kg per day). Resolution of symptoms occurred within several days after antibiotics were begun. Serum bactericidal titers against the organism, obtained during peak antibiotic levels, were 1:8 or greater on several occasions, and blood cultures were negative while the <span class="yellow">patient</span> was receiving antibiotics. M-mode echocardiography demonstrated left atrial enlargement but no definable abnormalities of the mitral or aortic valves. Intravenous pyelogram, oral cholecystogram, cystoscopy, liver-spleen scan, and upper and lower gastrointestinal series were normal except for a few sigmoid diverticuli. Flexible signoidoscopy demonstrated both a small perianal fissure and hemorrhoids. Blood cultures two weeks after therapy were negative. <br><br> Second Admission (June 19-August 4, 1981) <br><br> In June 1981, he again noted intermittent fever, night sweats, and fatigue. Group D streptococci grew from three sets of blood cultures and he was admitted to the West Haven VA Medical Center for recurrent endocarditis. On examination a somewhat louder apical systolic murmur was noted. The ESR was 50 mm/hour and rheumatoid factor titer was 1:320. Serum complement levels were normal and cryoglobulins were not detectable. Chest films, EKG, and urinalysis were normal. Cardiac M-mode echocardiogram revealed a globular mass attached to the posterior mitral valve leaflet with prolapse into a slightly enlarged left atrium. A twodimensional echocardiogram confirmed mitral valve prolapse and suggested a posterior leaflet vegetation. Gallium citrate scan was negative. <br><br> Three separate morphologic colony variants were isolated from blood, each identified as <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span> by Dr. R.R. Facklam (Center for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia). The <span class="yellow">patient</span> received intravenous penicillin (20 million units per day) and gentamicin (3 mg per kg per day) for six weeks with improvement. Peak serum bactericidal titers of 1:8 or greater were achieved against two of the colony variants; however, against the large colony morphotype, a titer of only 1:2 was obtained. An enlarged left atrium with intermittent fluttering and prolapse of the mitral valve was noted on echocardiography three weeks into therapy. Multiple blood cultures taken while the <span class="yellow">patient</span> was receiving antibiotics were negative, as were those obtained 48 and 72 hours after discontinuation of antibiotics. <br><br> 244 <br><br> <span class="yellow">S. FAECIUM</span> ENDOCARDITIS <br><br> Third Admission (August 12-October 4, 1981) <br><br> Withing a week following discharge, the <span class="yellow">patient</span> again developed fever, nocturnal sweats, and malaise. <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span> (large colony morphotype, and poorly growing small colony morphotype) grew from six sets of blood cultures obtained on admission. Penicillin (30 million units/day) and gentamicin (3 mg/kg/day) were again administered, initially achieving peak serum inhibitory and bactericidal dilutions of 1:16 and 1:8 against the organism, respectively. However, the organism had a lowlevel resistance to streptomycin (MIC < 125 /Ag/ml), and streptomycin (2 grams per day) was substituted for gentamicin two weeks into antibiotic therapy. Repeat echocardiograms showed irregular and shaggy densities of both mitral valve leaflets with partial prolapse. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated marked mitral valve prolapse with mitral regurgitation. A radiolucent filling defect was noted, suggesting a coronary artery embolus at the origin of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, causing 75 percent occlusion of the lumen. The <span class="yellow">patient</span> underwent mitral valve replacement, receiving a number 31 porcine Hancock bioprosthesis and bypass graft to the midportion of the LAD. The mitral valve was thickened with several ruptured chordae of the posterior leaflet noted, but no vegetations. The aortic valve appeared normal, with no visible septal or ring abscesses. The occlusion in the LAD was not approached to avoid embolizing distal fragments. <br><br> Histopathologically the mitral valve showed mild fibrosis and myxoid degeneration without inflammatory changes. Bacterial and fungal stains were negative but <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span> grew from fragments of the resected valve. Following surgery the <span class="yellow">patient</span> received six additional weeks parenteral penicillin and streptomycin. Repeat blood cultures on this regimen and following therapy were negative. Evaluation six months following discontinuation of antibiotics showed no evidence of recurrent endocarditis. <br><br> LABORATORY EVALUATION <br><br> The minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of penicillin, ampicillin, and tobramycin against the <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span> isolated from the <span class="yellow">patient</span>'s blood cultures <br><br> TABLE 1 <br><br> Minimum Inhibitory and Bactericidal Concentrations of Antibiotics, <br><br> Against <span class="yellow">Streptococcus faecium</span> Isolates from Blood Cultures <br><br> Date       Penicillin     Ampicillin         Tobramycin <br><br> Organism         Isolated      MIC        MIC       MBC      MIC       MBC <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span>, prior to ampicillin/ <br><br> tobramycin therapy    3/17/81        2          1        2        >32       >32 <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span>, after ampicillin/ <br><br> tobramycin therapy <br><br> a.

Following combined therapy with ampicillin and tobramycin and relapse of endocarditis, three morphological variants were isolated from blood cultures and also evaluated. <br><br> Twenty-four hour time-kill curves for penicillin in combination with various aminoglycosides were performed by Dr. Robert Moellering on the <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span> isolated from the <span class="yellow">patient</span>'s blood immediately prior to mitral valve excision and replacement (Fig. 1). Synergy was readily demonstrable against this organism by penicillin-streptomycin and penicillin-gentamicin combinations in vitro, but not by penicillin-tobramycin. <br><br> DISCUSSION <br><br> Among streptococci, the enterococci are unusual in their relative resistance to a broad spectrum of antimicrobial agents, and single-agent therapy is rarely bactericidal against them [2]. Since Hunter's original observations in 1947, it has become increasingly clear that effective synergistic combinations of antibiotics are necessary to successfully treat enterococcal endocarditis [1]. <br><br> Although <span class="yellow">S. faecalis</span> represents the majority of clinical enterococcal isolates, <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span> nonetheless comprises 5-10 percent of these isolates in some series [3,4]. Moreover, major differences exist in antimicrobial susceptibility and resistance to penicillin-aminoglycoside synergism between these two enterococcal species. The MIC of penicillin against <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span> is higher and this organism is more resistant to a number of different combinations of penicillin and various aminoglycosides than is <span class="yellow">S. faecalis</span> [6]. <br><br> The mechanisms of resistance exhibited by enterococci to penicillin-aminoglycoside synergy have been investigated. Clinically achievable levels of amino<br><br> 246 <br><br> <span class="yellow">S. FAECIUM</span> ENDOCARDITIS <br><br> glycosides are generally ineffective against enterococci. This intrinsic low-level resistance (MIC c 250 isg/ml) is thought to be the result of poor antibiotic penetration of the bacterial cell wall. However, in the presence of antibiotics that interfere with cell wall synthesis, there is enhanced aminoglycoside uptake [7]. In concert, these events are the basis for penicillin-aminoglycoside synergism. Ribosomal resistance of the 30S subunit to streptomycin and defective uptake of gentamicin in the presence of penicillin have been reported mechanisms of resistance among enterococcal isolates [8,9]. However, in the majority of instances, failure of synergy involves plasmid-mediated production of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. For streptomycin and kanamycin, plasmid-mediated enzymatic inactivation confers high-level resistance (MIC > 2,000 Ag/ml) and correlates with failure of these aminoglycosides to exert a synergistic effect when combined with penicillin [10,11]. Plasmid-mediated modifying enzymes have been found in both <span class="yellow">S. faecalis</span> and <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span>' [12]. Currently, approximately one-half of clinical enterococcal isolates demonstrate high-level resistance to streptomycin and kanamycin [13]. <br><br> Combinations of penicillin with kanamycin, tobramycin, sisomicin, and netilmicin have consistently failed to demonstrate synergistic killing of <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span> in vitro [6]. This failure of synergy occurs even when high-level resistance to these aminoglycosides is not present. The mechanism of resistance appears to be related to the production of an inactivating enzyme that acetylates the aminoglycoside substrate at the 6' position1 [14]. The genetic basis for production of this enzyme has not been well-defined and plasmid transfer experiments have thus far been unsucessful in demonstrating the encodement of this enzyme by extrachromosomal DNA [14]. <br><br> Moellering et al. demonstrated in vivo, utilizing the <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> model of endocarditis, that penicillin and netilmicin were not efficacious in the treatment of endocarditis caused by a low-level aminoglycoside-resistant strain of <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span> [6]. Although combinations of penicillin with tobramycin, kanamycin, or sisomicin were not evaluated, the authors postulated that the same ineffectual result would have occurred. In the present case, the recurrence of <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span> endocarditis after six weeks of therapy with ampicillin and tobramycin confirms the therapeutic and clinical significance of their data, and emphasizes that tobramycin is not an aminoglycoside to be used for treatment of serious <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span> infections. <br><br> Bacterial tolerance has been suggested as a possible basis for therapeutic failures, particularly in the treatment of infections caused by <span class="yellow">Staphylococcus aureus</span> with defects in the production of autolysins. MBCs are generally several-fold higher than MICs and this phenomenon appears to be associated with the autolysin defect [5]. Lorian has also described the formation of numerous aberrant cross-walls by <span class="yellow">S. faecalis</span> grown in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of penicillin [15]. MBCs were only slightly higher than MICs for the three <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span> variants obtained from our <span class="yellow">patient</span>, and they did not appear to be tolerant strains of <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span>. There was no evidence that any of the morphological variants isolated were unusually resistant to antibiotics. Therefore, subsequent failure of therapy could not be explained on the basis of antibiotic resistance patterns. The initial failure of ampicillin and tobramycin therapy may have allowed the infecting organism to become better established and more difficult to eradicate from the valve.

Relapse of endocarditis might have been anticipated on the basis of previous experimental data showing lack of synergy when tobramycin is used against this organism. This case graphically illustrates the relevance of synergy studies to therapeutic considerations in the treatment of endocarditis. However, subsequent therapy with synergistic combinations of antibiotics did not result in cure. The data do not implicate tolerant organisms as a cause for relapses. Failure of therapy may have been related to the presence of protected organisms in vegetations which were seen on echocardiograms, and also suggested by the presence of a possible coronary artery embolus seen on coronary arteriograms. <br><br> In conclusion, speciation of isolates suspected of causing endocarditis and adequate synergy studies of antibiotic combinations are indicated before a long and expensive course of therapy with antimicrobial agents is undertaken for this disease. However, as this case also illustrates, demonstration of synergism in vitro does not assure clinical cure. <br><br> ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS <br><br> Dr. Goldstein was supported by training grant Al 07033-05 from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. <br><br> The authors gratefully acknowledge the advice, laboratory assistance, and careful review of this manuscript by Dr. Robert C.
