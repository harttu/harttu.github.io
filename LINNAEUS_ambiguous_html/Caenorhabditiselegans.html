Abstract
Scp160p is a 160 kDa protein in the <span class="yellow">yeast</span> <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> that contains 14 repeats of the hnRNP K-homology (KH) domain, and demonstrates significant sequence homology to a family of proteins collectively known as vigilins. As a first step towards defining the function of Scp160p, we have characterized the subcellular distribution and in vivo interactions of this protein. Using sucrose gradient fractionation studies we have demonstrated that Scp160p in cytoplasmic lysates is predominantly associated with polyribosomes. Furthermore, we have found that Scp160p is released from polyribosomes by EDTA in the form of a large complex of ≥1300 kDa that is sensitive both to RNase and NaCl. Using affinity-chromatography to isolate these complexes, we have identified two protein components other than Scp160p: poly(A) binding protein, Pab1p, and Bfr1p. The presence of Pab1p confirms these complexes to be mRNPs. The presence of Bfr1p is intriguing because the null phenotype for this gene is essentially the same as that reported for scp160-null cells: increased cell size and aberrant DNA content. These results demonstrate that Scp160p associates with polyribosome-bound mRNP complexes in vivo, implicating a role for this protein in one or more levels of mRNA metabolism in <span class="yellow">yeast</span>.<br><br>INTRODUCTION
Scp160p is a 1222 amino acid <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> protein that contains 14 copies of the hnRNP K homology (KH) domain, a highly conserved motif found in many proteins involved in RNA metabolism (1). KH domain-containing proteins appear to have diverse functions and have been identified in all kingdoms of life, including the ribosomal protein S3 from <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span> (1), Mer1p from <span class="yellow">S.cerevisiae</span>, a meiosis-specific splicing factor (1), MEX-3 from <span class="blue">Caenorhabditis elegans</span>, presumably involved in mRNA localization during development (2), and FMRP, the fragile-X mental retardation protein in <span class="yellow">humans</span> (3). A partial clone of Scp160p, known as HX, was one of the first multiple-KH proteins identified (1).
Whole cell immunofluorescence studies have demonstrated that Scp160p localizes to the cytoplasm, with enrichment around the nuclear envelope, and what appears to be the endoplasmic reticulum (3). Deletion of the SCP160 locus in <span class="yellow">yeast</span> is not lethal, but results in a complex phenotype, including increased DNA content per cell, missegregation of genetic markers during sporulation, and abnormal cell morphology, including increased size and irregular shape (4). Observation of this phenotype led to the hypothesis that Scp160p may function in regulating ploidy during cell division. More recently, Weber and colleagues demonstrated in vitro RNA binding activity of Scp160p using northwestern blot analyses; the protein was found to bind efficiently to ribohomopolymers and rRNA, but not to tRNA (5). Cell fractionation studies revealed that a large percentage of Scp160p associates with membrane-pellets, and is released by treatment with either 10 mM EDTA or 500 mM NaCl (5). While these authors interpreted these results to suggest that the nuclear envelope/ER localization of Scp160p was due primarily to interactions of the protein with membrane-bound polyribosomes, clear evidence of this association has not been reported (5). Currently, the relationship between the phenotype of scp160 null mutants and the RNA-binding activity of Scp160p remains unclear.
Scp160p demonstrates significant sequence homology (~23% identity and ~40% similarity at the amino acid level) to a class of vertebrate KH-domain proteins collectively known as vigilins. First identified in <span class="yellow">chicken</span>, vigilin homologues have now been found in <span class="yellow">human</span> (6), <span class="yellow">Xenopus laevis</span> (7), <span class="yellow">Drosophila melanogaster</span> (8), <span class="yellow">C.elegans</span> (5) and <span class="yellow">Schizosaccharomyces pombe</span>. While all of the vigilin proteins studied to date are reported to bind nucleic acid, both the type of nucleic acid bound and the functional significance of these interactions remain unclear. For example, Kruse and colleagues reported from their work with <span class="yellow">human</span> cells in culture that vigilin may be involved in the binding and transport of tRNA (9–11). In contrast, Dodson and Shapiro concluded from their work with Xenopus vigilin that, in response to estrogen, the protein bound specifically to the 3′ UTR of vitellogenin mRNA (7,12), potentially stabilizing the message (13). Lastly, DDP1, the <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> homolog of vigilin, was reported recently to interact with the dodeca-satellite repeat regions of centromeric heterochromatin in embryonic and larval cell nuclei, suggesting a possible role for this protein in heterochromatin structure (8).
The goal of the present study was to begin elucidating the function of Scp160p in <span class="yellow">yeast</span> by characterizing the subcellular distribution and macromolecular interactions of this protein. We have demonstrated that Scp160p in cytoplasmic lysates is associated predominantly with polyribosomes, and that following treatment with EDTA, Scp160p remains in an RNase/NaCl-sensitive complex of apparent molecular weight approximately ≥1300 kDa. Affinity purification of this complex revealed the presence of poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1p), a well-characterized component of eukaryotic mRNPs (14,15). Finally, a third abundant protein component of this complex was identified as Bfr1p, a protein not previously reported to associate with mRNPs. While the function of Bfr1p remains unknown, gene deletion reportedly leads to a phenotype remarkably similar to that of scp160 deletion (16). These results indicate a role for Scp160p in mRNA metabolism in <span class="yellow">yeast</span>, and by extension, support results seen with Xenopus vigilin in its interactions with mRNA. To our knowledge, the data reported here demonstrate Scp160p to be the first example of a KH-domain protein that functions as a component of polyribosome-associated mRNP complexes in the <span class="yellow">yeast</span>, <span class="yellow">S.cerevisiae</span>.<br><br>MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plasmids, <span class="yellow">yeast</span> strains and culture conditions
All recombinant DNA manipulations were performed according to standard techniques and utilized <span class="yellow">E.coli</span> strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene). The <span class="yellow">yeast</span> strain JFy1511, expressing FLAG–Scp160p, was derived by two-step gene replacement from strain yJJ52 (MATα gal7Δ102 ura3-52 trp1-289 ade1 lys1 leu2-3, 112; generously donated by Drs Mark Parthun and Judith Jaehning, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center), and confirmed by PCR. The wild-type SCP160 coding sequence was obtained by PCR amplification from a genomic DNA preparation from yJFK1 (MATα gal7Δ102 ura3-52 trp1-289 ade1 lys1 leu2-3, 112 ΔGAL80::URA3), using a 16:1 mixture of Taq (Fisher Biotech) and Pfu (Stratagene) DNA polymerases and the following primers: Scp160F1 (5′-GCCGGTCGA-CTAACTGCAATGTCTGAAGAACAAACCGCTATTG-3′) and Scp160R1 (5′-GCGCGTCGACGAGCTTGTCTATCTT-CTTAAGG-3′). A wild-type SCP160 genomic clone, containing 1 kb upstream and 300 bp downstream sequence was PCR amplified from yJFK1 genomic DNA using the primers Scp160F0 (5′-GCCGAGCTCACACCAGCTTTGTCCTGG-3′) and Scp160R2 (5′-GCGCAAGCTTGTGCGGTA-TCCCAGTCTATG-3′). The resultant clone was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. The N-terminal FLAG and HA tags were added using PCR with the primers ScpFLAGF1(5′-CCAT-TATAACTGCAATGGACTACAAGGACGACGACGACGAC-AAGATGTCTGAAGAACAAACCGCTATTG-3′) and ScpHAF1 (5′-CCCCCTCCTGTCGACATTATAACTGCAATGCACCA-TCACCATCACCATTCTGAAGAACAAACCGCTATTG-3′) respectively. For integration, constructs containing the 1 kb upstream and 300 bp downstream sequence were subcloned into the plasmid YIplac211 (17) using SacI and HindIII restriction sites. The HA-tagged construct was subcloned into the low copy number plasmid, YCplac22 using SacI and HindIII restriction sites. The SCP160 deletion construct was made by removal of a 3.4 kb ApaI–KpnI fragment from the coding region of this construct, followed by treatment with Klenow fragment and re-ligation following attachment of BamHI linker oligonucleotides. Genomic integration of the plasmid sequences and subsequent removal of the endogenous SCP160 allele were achieved by standard two-step gene replacement techniques (18) and confirmed by PCR. The N-terminally HA-tagged allele of BFR1 was generated by PCR-amplifiction of the BFR1 locus from wild-type (W303) <span class="yellow">yeast</span> genomic DNA using the primers BFR1HAF1 (5′-CCGCGGATCCATGTACC-CATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTATGTCCTCCCAAC-AACACAA-3′) and BFR1HINDR1 (5′-CCGCAAGCTTGTCG-ACTATTTCATATGCCACAGGAAACAG-3′), and subcloned into YIPlac211. The BFR1 promoter region was PCR-amplified in a similar manner using the primers BFR1SACF1 (5′-CCGCGAG-CTCAGCATTAAGCATTCACGAGC-3′) and BFR1BAMR1 (5′-CCGCGGATCCGGCAATGGCTGTGTTGTTAGA-3′) and subcloned into the appropriate position upstream of the HA–Bfr1p open reading frame in the plasmid backbone. The entire open reading frame was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Finally, the HA–BFR1 allele was substituted into the <span class="yellow">yeast</span> genome in place of the native allele using linearization with SphI and standard two-step gene replacement techniques. All <span class="yellow">yeast</span> transformations and culture manipulations were performed according to standard protocols as described elsewhere (19).<br><br>Confirmation of genomic integrations
All genomic integrations were confirmed by PCR amplifications from purified <span class="yellow">yeast</span> genomic DNA. For scp160 deletion mutants, the primers Scp160PF (5′-GATTTCCTAACTTTCC-GTCTA-3′) and Scp160R5 (5′-GCGCAAGCTTCACCGCCTTATAACGAAGAC-3′) that flanked the deleted region were used.
Similarly, epitope tags on Scp160p were confirmed by PCR using primers that flanked the tag sequence. Positive clones were further confirmed by western blot analysis of crude cell lysates using the appropriate anti-tag antibodies. The presence of HA–Bfr1p in cells was confirmed by western blot analysis of soluble cell lysates using 12CA5 mAb (Boehringer Mannheim).<br><br>Polyribosome isolation
Polyribosomes were isolated using a combination of protocols described by Stansfield and colleagues (20) and by Dr Maurice Swanson (personal communication). In brief, a 100 ml culture of <span class="yellow">yeast</span> was grown in either YEPD or Hartwell synthetic medium, to early-log phase (OD600 = 1.0), at which time cyclohexamide (Sigma) was added directly to the culture to a final concentration of 100 µg/ml. The culture was incubated on ice for 15 min, and cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 r.p.m./10 min). Following two washes in 10 ml of water containing 100 µg/ml cyclohexamide, cells were lysed by vortex agitation with an equal volume of glass beads in 1 ml lysis buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.2, 50 mM KCl, 30 mM MgCl2, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 200 µg/ml cyclohexamide, 2 µg/ml aprotonin, 1 mM PMSF, 0.5 µg/ml leupeptin, 2.9 µg/ml E64, 1 µg/ml antipain, 0.2 µg/ml chymostatin). Lysate was transferred to a clean microfuge tube, and centrifuged 10 min at 3000 g at 4°C. The supernatant was again transferred to a clean microfuge tube and centrifuged at 12 000 g for 15 min at 4°C, and then assayed for absorbance at 260 nm.
Approximately 12 OD260 units were loaded onto a 11 ml 15–45% sucrose gradient made in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 70 mM NH4Cl, 4 mM MgOAc, using a Gradient Master automatic system, and the gradient was centrifuged in a SW41ti rotor (Beckman) at 39 000 r.p.m. for 2.5 h. 0.5 ml fractions were collected using an Isco gradient fractionator, and gradient profiles were determined by monitoring absorbance at 254 nm. For EDTA controls, lysis buffer containing 5 mM MgCl2 was used, and 30 mM EDTA was added to the sample before loading onto the gradient. Where indicated, addition of 50 U/ml of RNase One (Promega) was performed prior to loading the sample onto the gradient.<br><br>Gel filtration chromatography
Gel filtration chromatography was performed using a 120 ml Hi-Prep S-300 Sephacryl column (Pharmacia) with a cut-off of 1300 kDa, attached to an FPLC system (Pharmacia). The column had been calibrated previously using the following molecular weight standards (Sigma): blue dextran (2000 kDa), thyroglobulin (669 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), and <span class="yellow">bovine</span> serum albumin (66 kDa). <span class="yellow">Yeast</span> were lysed as described for polyribosome analysis, with an additional clarification by passage through a 0.2 µm syringe-tip filter (Acrodisc) and run over the column at a rate of 0.5 ml/min in polyribosome lysis buffer following treatment with the indicated reagents. Fractions (2.0 ml) were collected, from which 12 µl were combined with sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mM dithiothreitol, 60 mM Tris pH 6.8, 0.001% bromophenol blue) and analyzed by western blot using the indicated antibodies.<br><br>α-FLAG affinity chromatography
For most experiments, one liter <span class="yellow">yeast</span> cultures were grown to early log-phase and harvested by centrifugation. Cells were washed twice in T75 buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 75 mM NaCl) and then were lysed by vortex agitation with an equal volume of glass beads in 4 ml T75 buffer containing 30 mM EDTA. Lysate was transferred to a clean microfuge tube, and centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 g at 4°C. The supernatant was again transferred to a clean microfuge tube and centrifuged at 12 000 g for 15 min at 4°C, and finally passed through a 0.2 µm syringe filter. Lysate was then pre-purified by running over the S-300 gel-filtration column in T75 buffer, with pooling of the void volume fractions (~10 ml total). For several experiments (Fig. 5A, B, E and F), a low concentration (<10 µg/ml) of FLAG peptide (N-DYKDDDDK-C) was added to this sample. This void material was then loaded onto a 1 ml M2 α-FLAG column (Sigma); column flow-through was passed over the column a second time. The column was then washed extensively with 75 ml T75 buffer; material bound to the column was eluted with 5 ml T75 containing 184 mg/ml FLAG peptide. The peptide solution was allowed to incubate on the column for 20 min prior to collection of the first 1 ml fraction; subsequent fractions were collected every 10 min. Samples of crude material, S-300 void, α-FLAG flow-through, first and last wash, and eluate fractions were analyzed by western blot using the indicated antibodies. For Figure 5A and E, samples of first and last wash and eluate fractions were concentrated, run on SDS–PAGE and stained with colloidal G250 Coomassie.<br><br>Concentration of samples
Where indicated, samples were concentrated using the method of Traub et al. (21). 400 µl of sample were transferred to a microfuge tube, and combined with 400 µl of methanol, and 100 µl of chloroform. Samples were then vortexed vigorously, and centrifuged for 5 min at 12 000 g. The supernatant was discarded, leaving the interface intact, and an additional 400 µl of methanol was added to each tube. Samples were then inverted several times, and centrifuged again for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the protein pellet was air-dried and resuspended in 1× sample buffer.<br><br>Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (19). Briefly, samples to be analyzed were mixed with sample buffer, boiled, electrophoresed through a 10% SDS–polyacrylamide gel, and electro-blotted onto nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad). FLAG–Scp160p fusion protein was detected by incubation of the filter with <span class="yellow">mouse</span> M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (10 µg/ml final concentration), followed by HRP-conjugated <span class="yellow">sheep</span> anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> secondary antibody (Amersham), diluted 1:5000 as per the manufacturer’s instructions, and ECL reagent (Amersham), followed by exposure to X-ray film. HA-tagged Scp160p and HA-tagged Bfr1p were detected using the 12CA5 mAb (Boehringer Mannheim) at a final concentration of 0.8 µg/ml; Pab1p and Pub1p were detected using 1G1 mAb at 1:5000, and 4C3 mAb at 1:1000, respectively, both generous gifts from Dr Maurice Swanson (22,23). Where appropriate, films were analyzed by scanning densitometry (Molecular Dynamics), and quantitated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics).<br><br>Colloidal G250 coomassie staining
Procedure used was that of Neuhoff (24). Briefly, a one liter stock of staining solution was prepared containing 1 g Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 (Sigma), 100 g ammonium sulfate (Sigma), and 11.76 ml 85% phosphoric acid (Fisher). Following SDS–PAGE, gels were fixed in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid for 10 min. Gels were then rinsed several times in water, then stained using 40 ml of the stock staining solution mixed with 10 ml methanol, for 2 h at room temperature. Stain was then poured off, and residual stain was removed by rinsing in water. By performing a standard analysis using <span class="yellow">bovine</span> serum albumin, the stain was able to detect ~15 ng total protein per lane.<br><br>Pichia expression system
An N-terminally HIS6/FLAG-tagged allele of the SCP160 coding sequence was blunt-end sub-cloned into the BamHI/SnaBI sites of the Pichia expression vector pPIC3.5K (Invitrogen). The construct was then linearized using SalI and integrated into the genome of the Pichia strain GS115 (Invitrogen). High expression transformants were selected initially on histidine-deficient medium followed by selection on increasing concentrations of G418 (US Biological). Crude lysates of the resultant transformants were then confirmed by western blot analysis with the anti-FLAG antibody M2, and the best expressing strain was cultured in a fermenter, harvested, and lysed by agitation with glass beads. To purify Scp160p, 2 ml of crude lysate was first diluted to 10 ml with 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl, then twice passed over a 1 ml α-FLAG affinity column. The column was then washed with 75 ml of 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl, and then eluted with 184 µg/ml FLAG peptide prepared in the same buffer.<br><br>
RESULTS
Expression of tagged Scp160p in <span class="yellow">yeast</span>
An N-terminal FLAG-tagged form of Scp160p was created to facilitate detection of the protein in cells and extracts (Fig. 1A). To probe functionality of this fusion protein, we used two-step gene replacement (18) to substitute the modified allele into the SCP160 locus of haploid <span class="yellow">yeast</span>, and then tested the morphological phenotype of the resultant cells. All strains were confirmed by PCR analysis of the SCP160 locus with appropriate primers (Materials and Methods), and expression of the tagged protein was confirmed by western blot analysis with the appropriate antibody (M2αFLAG) (Fig. 1B). In all cases, <span class="yellow">yeast</span> expressing tagged Scp160p in place of the native protein appeared indistinguishable from the corresponding wild-type strains (data not shown). As a negative control, we also deleted almost the entire SCP160 coding region from the genomes of these <span class="yellow">yeast</span> strains (Fig. 1A), and confirmed the expected mutant phenotype (data not shown).<br><br>Scp160p associates with polyribosomes
To test the hypothesis that Scp160p associates with polyribosomes we used sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation to size-fractionate subcellular components of lysates prepared from <span class="yellow">yeast</span> expressing the N-terminal FLAG-tagged Scp160p protein. Western blot analyses of gradient fractions with an α-FLAG antibody (M2, Boehringer Mannheim), revealed a 160 kDa band that was most abundant in the denser fractions, consistent with the location of polyribosomes (>80S) (Fig. 2A, solid arrow). A convenient internal control for these gradients was provided by an unknown endogenous <span class="yellow">yeast</span> cross-reacting protein at ~100 kDa, that exemplified the migration pattern of a free protein, appearing only in the upper fractions of the gradient (Fig. 2A, open arrow).
To determine whether the migration pattern of Scp160p in these sucrose gradients truly reflected association with <span class="yellow">yeast</span> polyribosomes, lysates were pre-treated with either 30 mM EDTA or 50 U/ml RNase One (Promega) immediately prior to sucrose gradient fractionation. EDTA chelates Mg2+ cations, resulting in the dissociation of the small and large ribosomal subunits, reflected in gradient profiles (OD254) by the disappearance of 80S monosomes and polyribosomes along with a marked increase in the abundance of free ribosomal subunits (Fig. 2B). Under these conditions, the greatest intensity of FLAG–Scp160p signal was seen only in the upper-most fractions of the gradient (Fig. 2B). Alternatively, pre-treatment of lysates with RNase, which results in inter-ribosomal severing of translating messages, gave rise to a large pool of single 80S ribosomes (Fig. 2C). Again, FLAG–Scp160p was shifted to the uppermost fractions of these gradients. Although some of the Scp160p signal was detected in fractions larger than 40S, the migration pattern of the 100 kDa cross-reacting protein in these experiments indicated that RNase treatment caused an apparent diffusion of material in the upper portion of the gradient.<br><br>Characterization of Scp160p-containing complexes following EDTA and RNase treatment
Gel-filtration chromatography was used to determine the apparent molecular weight of Scp160p following its release from polyribosomes by both EDTA and RNase treatment. Lysates were prepared as described above for sucrose gradient analysis, but were instead size fractionated over a Sephacryl S-300 Hi-Prep column, with an inclusion cut-off of 1300 kDa. As expected, Scp160p from untreated lysates eluted in the void volume, confirming its association with large complexes, ostensibly polyribosomes (Fig. 3A, solid arrow). In EDTA treated lysates, all Scp160p signal was still detected in the void volume, indicating it remained in a complex of >1300 kDa (Fig. 3B, solid arrow). In contrast, limited RNase treatment (10 min) resulted in the appearance of an Scp160p-containing species of ~450 kDa, in addition to a fraction still visible in the void (Fig. 3C, solid arrow). More extensive RNase treatment (30 min) led to complete conversion to the 450 kDa species (Fig. 3D, solid arrow). Sequential treatment, first with RNase, then with EDTA, also resulted in a 450 kDa species (data not shown), suggesting that all components of this apparent 450 kDa complex were also present following EDTA treatment alone. As before, the 100 kDa, endogenous α-FLAG cross-reacting protein (Fig. 3, open arrows) served as a convenient internal control, eluting from the column at a volume consistent with its expected monomeric size.
To characterize further the stability of the large (apparent molecular weight >1300 kDa), EDTA-resistant complex, lysates were treated with increasing concentrations of NaCl prior to size fractionation (Fig. 3, panels E, F and G). As shown in Figure 3E, at 75 mM NaCl, the large complex remained intact. However, at a NaCl concentration of 150 mM, the Scp160p complex was partially reduced to 450 kDa, with some signal still remaining in the void (Fig. 3F, solid arrow). Following treatment with 1 M NaCl, Scp160p was only visible as the 450 kDa species (Fig. 3G, solid arrow). The fact that RNase treatment and high salt both generated Scp160p species of similar apparent molecular weight suggests that these high salt concentrations resulted in the disassociation of RNA, and perhaps other components, from Scp160p.<br><br>Pab1p and Bfr1p are present in EDTA-resistant Scp160p-containing complexes
To determine if the >1300 kDa Scp160p-containing complexes remaining after EDTA treatment were mRNPs, we assayed for the presence of the <span class="yellow">yeast</span> poly(A) binding protein, Pab1p, following α-FLAG affinity purification as illustrated in Figure 4. Pab1p is an abundant and well-characterized component of mRNP complexes in <span class="yellow">yeast</span>, as well as higher eukaryotes (14,15,25). As seen in Figure 5A and B, Pab1p did co-purify with FLAG–Scp160p; moreover, treatment with RNase immediately prior to FLAG-purification completely abolished this interaction (Fig. 5C), indicating an RNA-dependant association between these two proteins.
We also probed the isolated complexes for the presence of another abundant mRNP-component protein, Pub1p (23,26). Pub1p, as opposed to Pab1p, is not reported to associate with polyribosomes, and is hypothesized to bind a pool of non-translatable mRNAs (23). As predicted, Pub1p did not co-purify with Scp160p (Fig. 5D). The absence of Pub1p in Scp160p-containing complexes served as a negative control, demonstrating that abundant RNA-binding proteins did not co-purify non-specifically by this protocol. In addition, we performed mock purifications using lysates from <span class="yellow">yeast</span> expressing the wild-type allele of SCP160 without the FLAG epitope (Fig. 5F), or with an unrelated FLAG-tagged protein, <span class="yellow">human</span> galactose 1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT) (Fig. 5G, lower panel). In neither case did Pab1p bind and elute from the FLAG affinity column. Finally, no bands were visible by colloidal G250 Coomassie staining of samples from the mock (wild-type) preparations (Fig. 5E), further demonstrating the specificity of this procedure.
By colloidal G250 Coomassie staining (Materials and Methods) of the FLAG-purified complex, we observed in addition to Scp160p, two major bands, at ~70 kDa and ~55 kDa, which ostensibly represent co-purifying proteins (Fig. 5A, bottom panel). Western blot analysis suggested that the ~70 kDa species is Pab1p. To identify the 55 kDa protein, that band was excised from the gel, and sent to the Keck microchemical facility at Yale University for analysis by in gel tryptic digestion, followed by MALDI-mass spectrometry. The results of these analyses clearly identified the unknown protein as Bfr1p. To confirm this result, an N-terminal HA tag was engineered onto the genomic BFR1 locus in strains expressing FLAG-tagged or wild-type Scp160p. Scp160p complexes were then isolated from both of these strains using the protocol described above. As seen in Figure 6, an HA-tagged protein of ~55 kDa (center panel) appears in α-FLAG column elutions only when FLAG–Scp160p is also present (top panel). No signal is visible in mock purifications of extracts where Scp160p is not FLAG-tagged (bottom panel).<br><br>Monomeric Scp160p migrates as a ~450 kDa protein under native conditions
As a first step to characterize the post RNase/NaCl 450 kDa Scp160p species we compared it with Scp160p over-expressed and purified from an exogenous host, the <span class="yellow">yeast</span> <span class="yellow">Pichia pastoris</span>. The purified N-terminal FLAG/hexahistidine-tagged Scp160p was run over an S300 gel filtration column; 2 ml fractions were collected and analyzed by α-FLAG western blot. As seen in Figure 7A, purified Scp160p eluted at a volume consistent with a >443 kDa protein. To confirm that no other proteins were associated with the purified Scp160p, 12 µl of the protein was run on SDS–PAGE and subjected to colloidal G250 Coomassie staining before loading on the S-300 column (Fig. 7B). As shown, no bands other than Scp160p were visible.
Several KH-domain proteins, including Sam68 and FMRP, have been reported to form homodimers in vivo (27). Therefore, we explored the possibility that the ~450 kDa Scp160p species might contain two or more copies of Scp160p. To test this hypothesis, <span class="yellow">yeast</span> expressing FLAG–Scp160p were transfected with a centromeric plasmid, YCplac22–HA–Scp160p, encoding a distinct, HA-tagged allele of the protein. The functionality of this tagged protein had previously been demonstrated by polyribosome association as well as complementation of the null morphological phenotype in cells expressing only HA–Scp160p (data not shown). As seen in Figure 7C, when <span class="yellow">yeast</span> co-expressing the two alleles were lysed and the FLAG-tagged protein was isolated as described above, no HA–Scp160p co-purified with the FLAG–Scp160p. These data strongly suggest that Scp160p does not form homo-dimers or higher-order multimers in vivo, and that the ~450 kDa species of Scp160p observed is simply the monomeric protein.<br><br>
DISCUSSION
The data presented here demonstrate two main points regarding the biochemical associations and function of Scp160p in <span class="yellow">yeast</span>. First, the sucrose gradient fractionation data clearly demonstrate that Scp160p exists primarily associated with large complexes, likely to be polyribosomes. To our knowledge, this is the first time a vigilin family member has been shown to associate with polyribosomes in this manner. Interestingly, Weber and colleagues did not observe sucrose gradient fractionation data consistent with polyribosome association of Scp160p (5). These authors hypothesized that Scp160p associates only with membrane-bound polyribosomes, and that Scp160p is not found complexed with cytosolic polyribosomes (5). Our data do not support this hypothesis, since unlike Weber and colleagues, we were able to detect significant amounts of Scp160p associated with polyribosomes without using detergents during preparation. There are several possible explanations for this discrepancy. First, the lysate buffer utilized by that group contained 100 mM NaCl, whereas our buffer contained 50 mM KCl. Our data shown in Figure 3 suggest that 100 mM NaCl may have caused an instability in the Scp160p–RNA interaction, leading to release from polyribosomes during their procedure. Secondly, Weber’s lysate buffer reportedly contained heparin to inhibit ribonucleases; a number of reports (28,29) suggest that heparin can disrupt RNA–protein interactions. Although we have not in the past included heparin in any of our experiments, we have observed disruption of the polyribosome association in buffer containing residual diethylpyrocarbonate, another inhibitor of ribonucleases (data not shown).
Second, our data provide compelling evidence that Scp160p is released from polyribosomes as a component of an mRNP complex. Since Scp160p does not remain associated with either single ribosomes or ribosomal subunits following treatment with EDTA or RNase, it seems unlikely that Scp160p is a constitutive component of the translational machinery. Partial purification of the EDTA-resistant Scp160p complexes allowed us to demonstrate the presence of Pab1p but not Pub1p in these preparations, which is consistent with the idea that Scp160p associates with polyribosomes as a component of mRNP complexes. Previously, Scp160p had been shown to bind ribohomopolymers and rRNA in vitro, although the in vivo nucleic acid targets of Scp160p were unknown (5). The presence of Pab1p in RNase-sensitive Scp160p complexes indicates that Scp160p is primarily bound to polyadenylated RNAs. Whether or not Scp160p binds only specific sets of mRNAs will be the subject of future studies.
In addition to Scp160p and Pab1p, we have identified a third component of the complex, the protein Bfr1p. The gene, BFR1, was originally identified in a screen for high-copy suppressors of Brefeldin-A induced lethality, suggesting a role in the secretory pathway (16). Interestingly, however, bfr1 null mutants do not demonstrate any defects in the secretory pathway, but rather display similar phenotypes to scp160 null mutants, most notably increased ploidy and increased cell size (16). It is therefore unclear whether Bfr1p is capable of functioning in both RNA metabolism and secretion directly, or if the Scp160p–Bfr1p complex regulates the expression of one or more secretory genes at the post-transcriptional level. Additionally, two-hybrid analysis indicated an interaction of Bfr1p with the protein Bbp1p, a component of the mitotic spindle apparatus (30). While Bbp1p is an essential gene, overexpression leads to a phenotype similar to both bfr1 and scp160 null strains (30). Future work will address the functional relationship between Scp160p and Bfr1p including the possibility that these proteins represent a regulatory mechanism connecting the translational machinery with cell division and/or the secretory pathway.
Following treatment with either RNase or >150 mM NaCl, Scp160p remained as an apparent ~450 kDa species. Considering that purified Scp160p alone also migrates at this size, we conclude that this apparent complex may consist only of Scp160p, although the presence of other small components cannot be ruled out at this time. Furthermore, by utilizing <span class="yellow">yeast</span> co-expressing two distinct epitope-tagged versions of Scp160p, we have ruled out the possibility of self-association of Scp160p. Although both tagged proteins appear functional, it remains a formal possibility that the tags somehow prevented formation of FLAG–HA hetero-complexes. Nonetheless, it seems most likely that native Scp160p monomers may simply migrate aberrantly under native conditions due to an unusual shape or some other physical property.
In conclusion we have shown convincing evidence that Scp160p exists in <span class="yellow">yeast</span> cytoplasmic extracts primarily associated with polyribosomes. We have purified Scp160p following disruption of polyribosomes with EDTA, and identified two associated proteins: Pab1p and Bfr1p. The presence of Pab1p suggests that Scp160p associates with polyribosomes as a component of an mRNP, demonstrating Scp160p to be the first <span class="yellow">S.cerevisiae</span> multiple-KH domain protein characterized to function in this way.<br><br>
<h3>pmcA1190194</h3>Structural organization and interactions of transmembrane domains in tetraspanin proteins
Abstract
Background
Proteins of the tetraspanin family contain four transmembrane domains (TM1-4) linked by two extracellular loops and a short intracellular loop, and have short intracellular N- and C-termini. While structure and function analysis of the larger extracellular loop has been performed, the organization and role of transmembrane domains have not been systematically assessed.<br><br>Results
Among 28 <span class="yellow">human</span> tetraspanin proteins, the TM1-3 sequences display a distinct heptad repeat motif (abcdefg)n. In TM1, position a is occupied by structurally conserved bulky residues and position d contains highly conserved Asn and Gly residues. In TM2, position a is occupied by conserved small residues (Gly/Ala/Thr), and position d has a conserved Gly and two bulky aliphatic residues. In TM3, three a positions of the heptad repeat are filled by two leucines and a glutamate/glutamine residue, and two d positions are occupied by either Phe/Tyr or Val/Ile/Leu residues. No heptad motif is apparent in TM4 sequences. Mutations of conserved glycines in <span class="yellow">human</span> CD9 (Gly25 and Gly32 in TM1; Gly67 and Gly74 in TM2) caused aggregation of mutant proteins inside the cell. Modeling of the TM1-TM2 interface in CD9, using a novel algorithm, predicts tight packing of conserved bulky residues against conserved Gly residues along the two helices. The homodimeric interface of CD9 was mapped, by disulfide cross-linking of single-cysteine mutants, to the vicinity of residues Leu14 and Phe17 in TM1 (positions g and c) and Gly77, Gly80 and Ala81 in TM2 (positions d, g and a, respectively). Mutations of a and d residues in both TM1 and TM2 (Gly25, Gly32, Gly67 and Gly74), involved in intramolecular TM1-TM2 interaction, also strongly diminished intermolecular interaction, as assessed by cross-linking of Cys80.<br><br>Conclusion
Our results suggest that tetraspanin intra- and intermolecular interactions are mediated by conserved residues in adjacent, but distinct regions of TM1 and TM2. A key structural element that defines TM1-TM2 interaction in tetraspanins is the specific packing of bulky residues against small residues.<br><br><br><br>Background
Tetraspanins constitute a large family of integral membrane proteins, characteristically containing 4, 6 or 8 conserved cysteine residues in the large extracellular loop (including the CCG and PxxCC motifs), which form disulfide bonds, and several conserved polar residues in the intracellular loop and transmembrane regions [1,2]. There are 32 putative tetraspanin family members in mammals, 37 in <span class="yellow">Drosophila melanogaster</span> and 20 in <span class="blue">Caenorhabditis elegans</span>. Tetraspanins play diverse roles in cell adhesion, migration and fusion processes, cellular activation and signaling (reviewed in refs. [2-4]). Mammalian tetraspanins such as CD9, CD63, CD81, CD82, CD151, rds/peripherin, and uroplakins Ia and Ib have been most extensively studied, with <span class="yellow">mouse</span> knock-out models available for CD9 [5-7], CD81 [8,9], CD151 [10] and a few others. However, the majority of tetraspanins are characterized very little, if at all, at genetic, biochemical or structural levels.
The large extracellular loop (LEL) of tetraspanins has received most attention, since it contains functionally important sites. Sequence QRD (194–196) in CD151 is important for association with integrins, which has functional consequences for integrin-dependent cell spreading and multicellular cable formation [11]. A site in the LEL of CD9, SFQ (residues 173–175), is essential for CD9 function in sperm-egg fusion [12]. The crystal structure of tetraspanin CD81 LEL revealed five α-helixes, A-E [13]. Helices A, B and E form a relatively conserved region in tetraspanins, whereas the region between helices B and E is the most variable [14]. Interestingly, the variable region contains most of the functionally important sites involved in tetraspanin protein-protein interactions.
A remarkable biochemical property of tetraspanin molecules is their ability to associate with a large number of other transmembrane proteins, including integrins, membrane-associated growth factors and receptors, MHC class II molecules, Ig superfamily proteins, and each other [2,3,15]. Several of these lateral associations of tetraspanins are detected in "mild" detergents (Brij series, CHAPS), but are disrupted by "strong" detergents such as Triton X-100 or SDS. Multiprotein complexes of tetraspanins and associated molecules, also called the "tetraspanin web" [16], may represent a distinct tetraspanin-enriched membrane microdomain [17,18]. The formation of this microdomain is influenced by palmitoylation of several conserved juxtamembrane cysteine residues in tetraspanins [19-21].
The transmembrane domains, encompassing nearly half of a tetraspanin protein, are the most conserved part of the molecule (Stipp et al. [1] and this study). However, very little functional information is available on these domains. The differential detergent sensitivity of tetraspanin-tetraspanin associations suggests that hydrophobic interactions between TM helices may play a role. Indeed, when the large extracellular loop (LEL) of CD151 is deleted, the molecule is still able to associate with other tetraspanins [22]. Thus, TM domains are strong candidates for mediating tetraspanin-tetraspanin interactions.
The importance of TM domain interactions in intramolecular organization was demonstrated in a study showing that CD82 fragment TM2-4, lacking TM1, was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, but was transported to the cell surface upon co-expression of TM1 [23]. This in vivo reconstitution experiment demonstrated a strong interaction between TM1 and the rest of the molecule. Expression of a truncated CD9 molecule (TM3-LEL-TM4) results in intracellular accumulation of the protein and significant misfolding of the LEL, as judged by inappropriate disulfide formation and diminished antibody reactivity (our unpublished data). Similarly, a CD9 epitope in the LEL is lost in molecules lacking either TM2+TM3 or just TM4 [24]. Thus, TM domain interactions and packing are crucial for proper folding, stability and transport of tetraspanin molecules.
In a previous study, we showed that covalent cross-linking of membrane-proximal cysteine residues can be used as a tool for detection of tetraspanin-tetraspanin associations [25]. Inhibition of cysteine palmitoylation by 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) made cysteines available for cross-linking and enabled demonstration of specific tetraspanin homodimerization and low levels of heterodimerization. We concluded that tetraspanin homodimers, formed in the Golgi, may be a fundamental structural unit within tetraspanin microdomains.
In this study, we carried out detailed sequence analysis of <span class="yellow">human</span> tetraspanin TM domains. We show that a heptad repeat containing conserved glycine, asparagine and large hydrophobic residues occurs in TM1 and TM2 domains, and predict tight intramolecular association of these two domains by packing of the large residues against the small residues. Moreover, by using cysteine cross-linking we map a dimerization interface in the <span class="yellow">human</span> CD9 protein, and show that conserved heptad motif glycine residues are also important for intermolecular CD9 associations.<br><br>Results
Sequence analysis of tetraspanin transmembrane domains: presence of the heptad repeat motif
We focused our attention on 28 <span class="yellow">human</span> tetraspanins identified from the SWISS-PROT and GenBank databases. All tetraspanins have in common four hydrophobic stretches (TM domains) of 20–25 residues, and contain highly conserved residues in the second extracellular loop, in particular the Cys-Cys-Gly (CCG) motif. Detailed analysis of the large extracellular loop sequences [14], and dendrograms based on full-length alignment can be found in earlier studies [26,27]. The length of each transmembrane domain was established based on previous sequence analysis of tetraspanin sequences [27,28], and on annotations to the database entries. Manual adjustments based on sequence homology and hydrophobicity profiles were done to fully delineate the TM domains. The resulting lengths of TM domains were: TM1 – 23 residues; TM2 – 21 residues; TM3 – 25 residues; TM4 – 25 residues. Two more residues could be added onto the N-terminal part of TM2; however, relatively small sequence conservation of these residues among tetraspanins and occurrence of polar/charged side chains in some tetraspanins precluded us from doing so for the global alignment.
Figures 1 and 2 show a multiple sequence alignment of four TM domains of 28 <span class="yellow">human</span> tetraspanins. For each position within the domains, consensus residues were determined and classified (with individual color code) in 4 categories: 1) large hydrophobic residues (including Val, Met, Leu, Ile, Phe, Tyr, Trp), 2) small residues (Gly, Ala, Ser and Thr), 3) Cys, and 4) Asn. When more than two types of residues occupied a given position in a TM, a dual-color pattern that reflected the prevalence of the particular residue type was used (Figure 1). Cysteine residues were shown separately due to their importance as palmitoylation target sites. The highly conserved asparagine residue in TM1 was considered separately. No proline residues are found in TM domains 1–3 of <span class="yellow">human</span> tetraspanins.
An inspection of the multiple sequence alignment reveals a repeating heptad amino acid pattern, (abcdefg)n, in TM1, 2 and 3 (Figure 1, 2). Heptad repeats promote helical coiled coil interactions in multiple soluble and membrane-spanning proteins [29-31]. In the heptad repeat, hydrophobic residues in positions a and d are of special importance, as they directly mediate interhelical contacts by creating a tight knobs-into-holes packing in the coiled coil structure [32]. For instance, in the leucine zipper of the <span class="yellow">yeast</span> transcription factor GCN4, positions a and d contain Val and Leu residues, respectively, with an Asn residue in a single a position forming a hydrogen bond across the GCN4 dimer interface [33].
In TM1 of tetraspanins, highly conserved Asn, Gly and Gly residues (numbers 18, 25 and 32 in the CD9 sequence) appear at d positions of the heptad repeats, and residues 14, 21 and 28 are at a positions (Figure 1). In TM2, residues 67, 74 and 81 (consensus Gly, Gly and Ala, respectively) occupy a positions, whereas residues 63, 70 and 77 are at d positions. Another highly conserved glycine, Gly80, occupies the 3rd g position in TM2. In TM3, the conserved pattern consists of two leucine residues (Leu89 and Leu96) and a glutamate/glutamine residue (Glu/Gln103) in a positions (Figure 2). Two d positions are also conserved – Phe/Tyr92 and Ile/Val/Leu99. TM4 lacks a conserved heptad pattern and has only a single conserved position, Glu/Gln209 (with four exceptions). These features of TM1-4 of tetraspanins are displayed on helical wheel diagrams (Figure 3).<br><br>Analysis of TM1 sequences
The conserved Asn-Gly-Gly motif, occupying designated d positions of the heptad repeat, is the most prominent structural feature of TM1. We also compared sequences of CD9 orthologs from 10 different organisms (the most available for any tetraspanin) to gain further insight into conservation and variability of the TM1 sequence. As shown in Figure 4, positions a, d and g in TM1 are among the most conserved (0, 1 and 1 substitution, respectively), while interspecies variability tends to occur in other positions: b (5 substitutions), c (4 substitutions), e (4 substitutions) and f (4 substitutions). Thus, the positions typically involved in coiled coil interactions (a and d) are the most conserved.
When residues of TM1 are plotted as a helical wheel, additional structural features are revealed (Figure 3). There are highly conserved aliphatic and aromatic residues in the first three a positions of the heptad motif (Phe15, Trp22 and Leu29 in CD9), as well as in g positions (Leu14, Phe21, Val28 in CD9). The "ridges" formed by these bulky residues are flanking the "groove"-forming Gly residues of the Asn-Gly-Gly position d motif. In contrast, b, c, e and f positions show an overall higher variability among tetraspanins, as also seen in the comparison of CD9 orthologs described above.<br><br>Analysis of TM2 sequences
A landmark feature of TM2 in tetraspanins is the presence of highly conserved glycine residues (Gly67, 74, 77 and 80 in CD9, Figure 1). Other substitutions at these positions are almost exclusively small residues, such as Ala or Ser. In addition, Ala, Ser or Thr occupy position 81. This residue, together with Gly67 and Gly74, forms face a of the helix. Residue Gly77 (position d) is preceded by conserved, chiefly large hydrophobic residues on the same helical face (Leu63 and Met70 in CD9). Extremely conserved Gly80 falls into heptad position g (Figure 3). Among CD9 orthologs, heptad positions a and d are absolutely conserved, whereas other positions have the following number of substitutions: b – 3; c – 2; e – 1; f – 3; g – 1 (Figure 4). Two of the f position residues in TM2 (65 and 79) also show higher variability among different tetraspanins (Figures 1, 3). Cysteine residues are frequently found near the cytoplasmic end of TM2 helix at positions 78 and 79; these cysteines are likely to be palmitoylated.<br><br>Analysis of TM3 and TM4 sequences
The TM3 domain provides another example of the heptad repeat pattern. Position a is occupied by two highly conserved leucine and a glutamate/glutamine residue (Leu89, Leu96 and Glu/Gln103 in CD9). Furthermore, two d positions are conserved – Phe/Tyr92 (aromatic residue) and Ile/Val99 (β-branched aliphatic residue; Figures 2, 3). In addition, residue 100 in position e is generally Phe or Leu. Among CD9 orthologs, position a has 1 substitution, positions b, c and f each have 6, positions d and e each have 2, and g has 4. Thus, as for TM1 and TM2, positions a and d are among the most conserved, but overall TM3 has more variable positions than TM1 or TM2 (Figure 3). Less than half of TM3 sequences contain cysteine residues, and those tend to occur at the internal positions of the helix (Figure 2).
TM4 shows less conservation among various tetraspanin family members than the other TM domains (Figures 2, 3). The only highly conserved feature is the glutamate/glutamine residue in position 209. In addition, one or two cysteine residues can be found at the C-terminal end of TM4 in some tetraspanins (e.g. CD9, CD81, CD151), and many sequences contain additional polar residues (Arg, Lys, His, Asn, Gln). No conserved heptad motif was identified in TM4, as also confirmed by analysis of substitutions in CD9 orthologs (data not shown).<br><br>Mutational analysis of conserved glycine residues in TM1 and TM2
The conserved nature of the Asn and Gly residues in TM1 and TM2 prompted an analysis of their functional role. To this end, we have probed whether mutations of these residues destabilize the protein molecule. We expressed a construct of the first and second TMs of CD9, connected by the small extracellular loop, and tagged with a C-terminal green fluorescent protein (TM(1+2)-GFP molecule). In <span class="yellow">human</span> rhabdomyosarcoma RD cells, the wild-type fusion protein localized mostly in a reticular, intracellular pattern, without forming any large aggregates (Figure 5, panel A). Remarkably, when double mutants Gly25Leu + Gly32Leu and Gly67Leu + Gly74Leu were expressed, the protein formed distinct large aggregates in a high proportion of cells (Figure 5, panels C and E). In contrast, double mutant Gly77Leu + Gly80Leu did not form such aggregates (Figure 5, panel G). Results with respective single mutants were similar to that with double mutants, with the aggregation being somewhat more pronounced for Leu substitutions of Gly67 and Gly74 compared to Gly25 and Gly32 mutations. No aggregation was observed for Asn18Ser and Asn18Tyr mutants (data not shown). Also, nearly identical results were obtained with <span class="yellow">human</span> HT1080 cells (data not shown).
We interpret these results as an indication that aggregating mutants are destabilized or misfolded while non-aggregating mutants retain the wild-type conformation. Intriguingly, mutations to the conserved GG7 motifs caused protein aggregation while the mutation of other glycines had no detectable effect. These results also suggest that wild-type GFP, which has weak tendency to self-associate, could enhance non-specific interactions of destabilized mutant TM(1+2) CD9 moieties, leading to their aggregation. Consistent with this hypothesis, the aggregation of Gly25Leu + Gly32Leu and Gly67Leu + Gly74Leu double mutants was suppressed when monomeric GFP molecule, Leu221Lys [34] was used (Figure 5, panels D and F). The use of monomeric GFP did not affect intercellular localization of wild-type CD9 TM(1+2) (Figure 5, panel B), or a Gly77Leu + Gly80Leu double mutant (Figure 5, panel H).
In summary, Leu substitutions of Gly residues that are part of the Asn-Gly-Gly (NGG7) motif in TM1, or Gly-Gly-Ala (GGA7) motif in TM2, resulted in destabilization and aggregation of GFP-fused TM(1+2) proteins, whereas substitutions of Gly77 or Gly80, which are not part of these motifs (Figure 3), failed to show such aggregation.<br><br>Prediction and modelling of interaction between TM1 and TM2
Consecutive helices in polytopic membrane proteins frequently interact [35]. Sequence analysis of TM1 and TM2 helices of tetraspanins reveals a remarkable complementarity in the distribution of large and small residues at heptad positions a and d along the helical axis (Figure 3), suggesting that these residues may interact. To further elucidate the potential for TM1-TM2 interaction, the putative interface was modeled using a novel algorithm that considers mutational data during each step of a Monte Carlo simulated annealing cycle (see Methods for details). Specifically, Gly25Leu, Gly32Leu, Gly67Leu and Gly74Leu were scored as disruptive mutations, while Asn18Ser, Gly77Leu and Gly80Leu were scored as silent mutations, based on their effects on protein stability (Figure 5 and data not shown).
The resulting model predicts left-handed crossing of TM1 and TM2 helices at an angle of +28°. The key element of the structure is the apposition of bulky and small heptad position a and d residues, as follows: Gly32-Leu63; Gly67-Leu29; Gly25-Met70; Gly74-Trp22; Asn18-Gly77; Ala81-Phe15 (Figure 6). Our model predicts that each of these residue pairs are in van der Waals contact. Additionally, two potential H-bonds are predicted in this model, indicating close packing: Gly67 Cα to Gly25 carbonyl oxygen, and Trp22 Cα to Met70 carbonyl oxygen. The packing is tighter in the ectodomain-proximal portion of the helices (Figure 6, panel B), as determined by Cα-Cα distances between interacting residue pairs.
The key elements of the model are corroborated by the presence of apparently complementary substitutions in TM1 and TM2 sequences of different tetraspanins (Figure 1, boxed residues). For example, Gly74 is predicted to interact with Trp22. In 8 of the 10 tetraspanins that contain a substitution for Gly74, a compensatory substitution occurs at the Trp22 position (Figure 1). Thus, a larger non-glycine side chain at position 74 may necessitate a less bulky non-Trp side chain in position 22. Likewise, the presence of a Cβ at position 25, typically occupied by glycine, necessitates a non-β-branched amino acid at position 70, which is occupied by a β-branched residue in nearly half of all cases. Indeed, we find that in each of 5 cases in which position 25 contains a Cβ, a leucine residue occurs in position 70. This analysis is consistent with our molecular model that suggests Leu70 will pack most favorably against a Cβ at position 25 than a β-branched residue or a methionine.<br><br>Role of TM1 and TM2 heptad motif residues in CD9 dimerization
To probe CD9 dimerization, we used a cysteine-mediated cross-linking approach. We established previously a simple and efficient method for cysteine-mediated cross-linking [25]. After cells are pre-treated with 2-BP for 16–24 hours to expose normally palmitoylated cysteines, the cysteines can be cross-linked using any of the following methods: a) Spontaneous oxidation in Brij97 lysates (a condition that preserves tetraspanin-tetraspanin associations), b) In situ cross-linking, by pre-lysis oxidation of cells with Cu2+-phenanthroline (CuP) to promote disulfide bond formation. c) In situ cross-linking with thiol-reactive cross-linking agents of defined length (e.g. DTME, BMB). The first two approaches produce in essence "zero-length" disulfides, indicative of close proximity of target cysteines and presumably high specificity of interaction. In contrast, chemical cross-linkers with 6–20 Å spacer arm may cross-link with higher efficiency, but not necessarily higher specificity. However, they provide advantages such as variable membrane permeability, and potential linkage cleavability. For tetraspanins such as CD9, membrane-permeable cross-linker DTME (13.3 Å-long, reducible) provides highly specific and efficient cross-linking [25]. Here we have used a cysteine cross-linking strategy, in combination with cysteine-scanning mutagenesis, to map the residues from TM1 and TM2 contributing to the CD9 dimerization interface.
For subsequent cross-linking experiments using CD9 TM(1+2)-GFP protein, the non-dimerizing form of GFP was used. This avoids potential GFP-dependent dimerization and aggregation that can be observed with wild-type GFP, especially when fusions with transmembrane proteins are studied [36]. Importantly, the Leu221Lys mutation in GFP prevented aggregation of mutant forms of CD9 TM(1+2), which was observed with wild-type GFP fusion (Figure 5). The TM(1+2) fragment of CD9 contains three native cysteines – Cys9, Cys78 and Cys79. Single-cysteine mutants of TM(1+2) were constructed, in which a cysteine was placed at various faces of TM1 or TM2 while all of the wild-type cysteines were simultaneously replaced by serines. The mutant proteins were transiently expressed in RD cells (having little endogenous CD9), which were then treated for 16–18 hours with 2-BP. To achieve maximal specificity in cross-linking we used a "zero-length" agent, CuP.
First, single-cysteine replacements were constructed for residues Leu14, Phe15, Gly16, Phe17 and Asn18, covering just over one complete helical turn at the beginning of TM1. While residue Asn18 is highly conserved, positions 14, 15 and 17 are occupied by bulky hydrophobic residues in most tetraspanins, whereas position 16 shows less conservation (Figures 1, 4). All of the single-cysteine mutants showed diffused pattern of protein localization, without any signs of aggregation. As shown in Figure 7A, the highest level of intermolecular cross-linking was observed for Leu14Cys and Phe17Cys mutants, a lower level for Phe15Cys and Gly16Cys mutants, and very little cross-linking for Asn18Cys substitution. These results indicate that: a) the first two transmembrane domains of CD9 alone can mediate its dimerization, and b) the g and c residues of TM1 (e.g. Leu14 and Phe17, Figure 3) are likely to be part of the intermolecular interface.
Similarly, single-cysteine substitutions were made for residues Gly77, Gly80 and Ala81 in TM2; in addition, proteins carrying a single wild-type cysteine, Cys9, Cys78 or Cys79, were tested. No protein aggregation was observed for any of these single-cysteine mutants. As shown in Figure 7B, the relatively low level of intermolecular cross-linking of wild-type CD9 TM(1+2)-GFP protein was enhanced dramatically in single-cysteine TM2 mutants Gly80Cys and Ala81Cys. The Gly77Cys mutant also had an elevated level of cross-linking. In contrast, any of the three native cysteines (9, 78 and 79) produced level of cross-linking not much greater than the wild-type TM(1+2) protein. Similar results were obtained with cysteine-reactive cross-linker BMB (data not shown). Likewise, comparable results were obtained with single-cysteine mutants of untagged, full-length CD9, using CuP (Figure 7C) as well as DTME cross-linker (data not shown).
These cross-linking results for TM1 and TM2 are consistent with our model that places residues Leu14, Phe17 and Gly80 on the same side of the TM1-TM2 pair (Figure 6, panel C). The strong cross-linking with Leu14Cys, Phe17Cys and Gly80Cys places the intermolecular interface toward the c and g phases of the TM1 helix, and the g phase of the TM2 helix, away from its e and f faces containing wild-type cysteines 78 and 79.
Critical residues at the TM1-TM2 interface also affect dimerization indirectly. To assess specific CD9 dimerization, we used a Gly80Cys substitution at the intermolecular interface for cross-linking. As shown in Figure 8A, single replacements of conserved heptad residues in positions 18, 25, 32, 67 and 74 (Asn18Ser, Gly25/32/67/74→Leu) strongly decreased the cross-linking mediated by Cys80. The effect was most pronounced for mutations of residues, Gly32 and Gly67, located in the tightly packed extracellular end of TM helices (Figure 6). In contrast, mutations of residues closer to the cytoplasmic end of TM2 (Gly74 and especially Ala81) had only modest to very little effect on cross-linking.
Relatively low efficiency of intermolecular cross-linking via native residues Cys9, 78, and 79 (Figures 7B,C) correlates well with the predicted location of Cys78 and 79 away from the dimeric interface (Figure 3), and suggests that the extramembrane N-terminal part of CD9 (residues 1–13) does not self-associate. We next examined whether mutations of conserved Asn and Gly residues in TM1 and TM2 decreased low-level background cross-linking via native cysteines. As expected, these mutations had virtually no effect on dimer formation of CD9 TM(1+2)-GFP (Figure 8B). The level of covalent dimer formed was not diminished for triple Asn18Ser + Gly25Leu + Gly32Leu and double Gly67Leu + Gly74Leu mutants, compared to wild-type TM(1+2) CD9 molecule. Similarly, the same triple and double mutations in the context of full-length CD9-GFP protein (with six cysteines) produced wild-type levels of cross-linking (Figure 8C). We interpret these findings as evidence for at least two types of associations between CD9 molecules: primary, involving residues 14, 17 and 80, and dependent on integrity of conserved heptad residues in TM1 and TM2, and less efficient secondary interactions, probably representing random collision events, and independent of the heptad residues (see Discussion for more details).<br><br>TM3 and TM4 cysteine residues in CD9 dimerization
After identifying the roles of conserved TM1 and TM2 residues in CD9 dimerization, we next probed whether residues proximal to TM domains 3 and 4 are also involved. To this end, disulfide cross-linking of full-length CD9 molecules containing 3 C-terminal cysteines (87, just before TM3; 218 and 219 in TM4) or 3 N-terminal cysteines (9, 78 and 79) was compared (Figure 9). We found that the C-terminal cysteines were only slightly better than N-terminal cysteines with respect to detection of CD9 dimers. However, markedly more trimers and tetramers were detected using C-terminal cysteines. Thus, residues 87, 218 and 219 at TM3 and TM4 in CD9 can together form contacts across the dimeric interface and also additional contacts with other neighboring CD9 molecules.<br><br>
Discussion
Here we provide the first detailed analysis of tetraspanin protein transmembrane domains. First, we show 1) the presence of a heptad repeat motif in TM1 and TM2, containing highly conserved Asn and Gly residues, 2) a leucine and glutamate/glutamine-containing heptad motif in TM3, and 3) high variability and absence of heptad repeats in TM4 sequences. Second, we provide evidence for a specific, intramolecular interaction between TM1 and TM2 domains, in which bulky hydrophobic residues pack against GG7 motif, and present a molecular model for this interaction. Third, experimental mapping of the CD9 dimerization interface firmly establishes an additional role for conserved TM1 and TM2 residues in dimeric intermolecular interactions. Fourth, preliminary evidence is provided to suggest that TM3 and TM4 domains contribute to expansion of CD9 dimers into higher order multimers.
Conserved residues in TM1 and TM2 of tetraspanins: role in intramolecular packing
We hypothesized that the first two transmembrane domains of tetraspanins might interact with each other because: a) consecutive TM domains frequently associate in known protein 3D structures [35], and b) they both contain a series of highly conserved amino acids – several Gly residues and an Asn residue (Figure 1). Conserved Gly residues are a frequent theme in the organization of interacting transmembrane domains. Analysis of 3D helix packing in polytopic membrane proteins reveals that Gly residues tend to localize in buried positions, especially at the helix-helix interfaces and helix crossing points [37,38]. Due to the absence of a side chain, Gly provides a flat surface for packing of a side chain from another residue, without loss of side-chain entropy upon interaction. The most common Gly-containing motif is GxxxG [39,40]. In glycophorin A (GpA), the major glycoprotein in erythrocyte cell membranes, Gly79 and Gly83 are part of the LIxxGVxxGVxxT sequence that promotes homodimerization of parallel transmembrane α-helixes [41,42]. In the GpA dimerization motif, Gly residues allow for tight packing in the right-handed helical crossing [43]. There are also examples of left-handed helical crossing in the context of a GxxxG motif [44]. Other membrane proteins that use the GxxxG motif for homo- or heterodimerization include <span class="yellow">bacteriophage M13</span> coat proteins [45], <span class="yellow">yeast</span> alpha factor receptor [46], integrin α IIb subunit [47], and ErbB1 receptor tyrosine kinase [48]. Other small residues, such as Ala and Ser, can substitute for Gly in this motif [49].
A protein motif in which Gly residues are separated by 6 other residues (GG7) is also common in transmembrane helices, especially in transporter/channel-like membrane proteins [50]. However, the structural features associated with this motif are not well known. In particular, it is unclear whether left-handed GG7 heptad repeat motif (as opposed to the "classic" right-handed GxxxG motif) can drive membrane helix association. In a recent work addressing this issue, Lear et al. [51] showed that a synthetic peptide containing Gly at heptad positions a and d could self-associate in vitro, likely in an antiparallel orientation. Heptad repeats containing conserved Gly residues occur in TM domains of α and β chains of MHC class II proteins, and mutations of the Gly residues disrupt the αβ heterodimer [52]. These examples demonstrate that Gly-based heptad motifs may be used for both intra- and intermolecular associations.
In this work, we identified a highly conserved GG7 motif in the first two tetraspanin TM domains. The GG7 sequence in tetraspanins is a part of a larger motif that also includes a conserved Asn residue in TM1 (NGG7) and an Ala/Ser/Thr residue in TM2 (GGA7). The seven-residue periodicity of these motifs strongly suggests their involvement in left-handed coiled coil packing reminiscent of the leucine zipper, rather than right-handed packing of the GpA-like GxxxG motif. For antiparallel helices, the left-handed crossing is in fact predominant over the right-handed in known TM domain structures [44].
In our model, heptad Gly residues in NGG7 and GGA7 sequences provide specific packing between antiparallel tetraspanin TM1 and TM2 helices by allowing tight van der Waals interactions with large hydrophobic residues (Figure 6). Highly efficient packing of bulky side chains against glycine residues is observed in known transmembrane protein 3D structures [38,53,54]. An example includes packing of helices M1 and M2 in potassium channel KcsA, where Val91 in M2 is paired with Gly43 in M1, and Leu36 in M1 contacts Ala98 and Gly99 in helix M2 [54,55]. In addition to facilitating helix-helix packing, Gly residues frequently provide additional CαH...O hydrogen bonds between two helices [44]. In our model, two Cα-backbone carbonyl H-bonds are predicted – between residues Gly27-Gly67, and Trp22-Met70.
Although polar and charged amino acid residues (such as Asn in the TM1 heptad motif) are infrequent in transmembrane domains, they are functionally important. Polar residues such as glutamine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid and asparagine can promote strong oligomerization of model membrane-associated helices [56-58]. Ruan et al. [59] used asparagine scanning mutagenesis to probe the interface of self-associating polyleucine helices by detecting their enhanced self-interaction in vitro and in the <span class="yellow">E. coli</span>-based ToxR assay. Thus, a hydrogen bond in an apolar environment can result in strong, though not necessarily specific, association of transmembrane helices. In fact, mutations to polar residues in transmembrane proteins are commonly associated with disease [60]. Because of this potential for non-specific interactions, polar residues tend to localize at buried positions in TM domains.
In our case, the conserved Asn18 residue in CD9 is predicted to be a part of the TM1-TM2 interface, though our model does not predict any electrostatic interaction between Asn18 and TM2 (Figure 6). Consistently, substitution such as Asn18Tyr (and Gly77Leu) in TM(1+2)-GFP protein was not destabilizing as analyzed by protein aggregation. Curiously, the full-length Asn18Ser CD9 migrated slightly slower on SDS-PAGE gel (data not shown), suggesting that Asn18 does play a role in maintaining conformation of the molecule. The Asn18Cys single-cysteine mutant shows very little intermolecular cross-linking (Figure 7A), supporting the proposed location of this residue at the intramolecular interface. It is tempting to speculate that the "pocket" between TM1 and TM2 lined by Asn18 and Gly77 might be important for accommodating palmitate moieties that target Cys78 and Cys79 residues, and/or important for access by the putative palmitoyl transferase to those residues. Understanding the exact role of these highly conserved Asn18 and Gly77 residues in tetraspanins awaits further investigation.
In summary, we identified conserved glycine residues of TM1 and TM2 of tetraspanins as key elements required for intramolecular packing. Mutations of these key residues (Gly25, Gly32, Gly67 and Gly74 in CD9) resulted in protein destabilization and aggregation. There is ample evidence in the literature for mutations in transmembrane proteins that lead to protein destabilization, misassembly and pathologic conditions [61]. Thus, we have identified conserved heptad Gly residues in TM1 and TM2 of tetraspanins as plausible targets of destabilizing mutations with potential functional consequences.<br><br>Intermolecular interactions in tetraspanins
Tetraspanin CD9 forms mostly homodimers, but also a low level of heterodimers with CD81 and CD151 [25]. Thus, mapping the dimerization interface is an important next step in structure-function analysis of tetraspanins. Disulfide-mediated cross-linking, often in combination with cysteine-scanning mutagenesis, is a common strategy to probe oligomerization or intersubunit interactions of transmembrane proteins such as histidine kinase EnvZ [62], M(3) muscarinic acetylcholine receptor [63], <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> lactose permease [64], synaptobrevin [65], integrins [66] and many others. In tetraspanins such as CD9, membrane-proximal cysteine residues are especially useful targets for disulfide trapping, as their linkage can be enhanced by pre-treating cells with 2-BP. While the ability of wild-type cysteines in CD9 to be cross-linked may indicate that they are close to the dimerization interface, more precise mapping was achieved here using cysteine-scanning mutagenesis.
Our data clearly identify regions, near the cytoplasmic face of TM1 and TM2, important for dimerization. Intermolecular zero-length cross-linking was highest when single cysteines were placed in positions 14, 17, 77, 80 and 81 in TM(1+2)-GFP molecule, or at positions 77, 80 or 81 in the full-length CD9 protein. Positions 14, 17 and 80 are distinct from the intramolecular interface and are on the same side of the TM1-TM2 pair (Figure 6). Thus, they are well-positioned to participate in an interaction with another molecule. At the same time, the model predicts that wild-type cysteines (Cys78, 79), which do not yield very efficient zero-length cross-linking, are on the other side of TM1-TM2 pair.
While using the cysteine at position 80 as the dimeric interface probe, mutations of conserved residues in TM1 and TM2 (especially Gly32 and Gly67 to Leu) clearly reduced intermolecular cross-linking. We do not suggest that those residues are directly involved in intermolecular interaction. Rather, we propose that destabilization of the intramolecular TM1-TM2 interaction by Gly to Leu substitutions (discussed above) causes an overall conformational change that reduces dimer formation.
An Ala81Leu mutation did not reduce cross-linking via Cys80, even though single-cysteine Ala81Cys molecules themselves produced a high level of cross-linking. These results, together with data on Gly32Leu and Gly67Leu mutations, are consistent with our model predicting that helices 1 and 2 interact more tightly near the extracellular end and less at the cytoplasmic end. This would give more flexibility to a cysteine at position 81 and also limit the effect of an Ala81Leu mutation. Location of this residue at the membrane/cytoplasmic border could also make it more accessible to CuP reagent as compared to residues buried in TM domain, thus elevating the efficiency of disulfide formation of the Ala81Cys mutant.<br><br>Multiple interfaces in tetraspanin molecules
In the full-length CD9 molecules, the 3 C-terminal cysteines (Cys87, 218 and 219) located at or in TM3 and TM4 promoted efficient dimer and even more efficient oligomer formation compared to the 3 N-terminal cysteines (Figure 9). Cys87 alone can be used to capture CD9 dimers [25]. These results suggest the existence of two dimeric interfaces in CD9 molecule – the TM 1-2/1-2 interface and the TM 3-4/3-4 interface (Figure 10). In a TM(1+2) molecule, the destabilization of 1–2 interaction, e.g. by Gly→Leu mutations, would affect the 1-2/1-2 interface, as discussed above. However, these mutations would not interfere with the 3-4/3-4 interface in a full-length molecule, which includes Cys87, 218 and 219. Thus, cross-linking of full-length molecules, containing all 6 cysteine residues, would be unaffected, as seen in Figure 8C. Furthermore, wild-type Cys9, Cys78 and Cys79 are apparently not at the primary 1-2/1-2 interface. Their relative inefficiency in cross-linking CD9 TM(1+2) protein likely reflects weak secondary contacts between the molecules, or possibly random collision events. Such events should be independent of mutations in the conserved Gly residues in TM1 and TM2, as was demonstrated in Figure 8B. The potential existence of two interfaces in tetraspanin molecules, 1-2/1-2 and 3-4/3-4, should provide enhanced flexibility for forming additional intermolecular contacts. Current understanding of tetraspanin microdomains assumes a few strong, primary homotypic and heterotypic tetraspanin complexes (e.g. CD9-CD9, CD9-CD81, CD151-α3 integrin, CD81-EWI2) that help bring together various other proteins, forming secondary-type associations. Such properties of tetraspanins may bring signaling molecules such as protein kinase C or phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase to the vicinity of integrins [67,68].
The organization of the TM3 domain points to a potential role in protein-protein interactions. A motif of Leu-Leu-Glu(Gln) spaced 7 residues apart (heptad positions a), with highly conserved residues in two consecutive positions d, poses as a likely interaction module. If responsible for heterologous protein-protein interactions, it would form another distinct interface of tetraspanin molecule. Our preliminary data indicate that replacing the Leu and Glu residues in TM3 of CD9 with Ala has no effect on cell surface expression of the protein and its dimerization (data not shown). It remains to be tested if interactions with other proteins will be affected. Similarly, the TM4 domain may provide additional contributions to lateral tetraspanin associations. Much higher sequence variability, and the lack of a distinct heptad pattern suggests that TM4 is a major contributor to diversity among tetraspanin complexes. Structure-function analysis of TM3 and TM4 domains in tetraspanins is the subject of ongoing investigation.<br><br>
Conclusion
We have defined the TM1-TM2 intramolecular interface in tetraspanin CD9, providing evidence for glycines (Gly25 and Gly32 in TM1, Gly67 and Gly74 in TM2) packing against apposing bulky aliphatic residues. Second, we mapped an intermolecular CD9 interface (involved in CD9 homodimer formation) to the vicinity of residues Leu14 and Phe17 in TM1 and Gly77, Gly80 and Ala81 in TM2. Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that TM3 and TM4 in CD9 may contribute to a second intermolecular interface. Key CD9 residues involved in intra- and intermolecular interactions are highly conserved throughout the tetraspanin family, thus suggesting that our findings will apply to most tetraspanins.<br><br>Methods
Materials
Cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). 2-bromopalmitate was from Fluka (Milwaukee, WI), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and 1,10-phenanthroline were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), and chemical cross-linkers dithio-bis-maleimidoethane (DTME) and 1,4-Bis-maleimidobutane (BMB) were purchased from Pierce Endogen (Rockford, IL). Triton X-100, protease inhibitor cocktail and FuGENE 6 transfection reagent were obtained from Roche (Indianapolis, IN). Restriction endonucleases and Pfu DNA polymerase were obtained New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and Stratagene (Carlsbad, CA), respectively. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Fisher Scientific (Pittsburg, PA).<br><br>Sequence analysis
Tetraspanin sequences were obtained from SWISS-PROT and GenBank databases. Locus designations, accession numbers and the most commonly used protein names are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. TM segments were delineated by inspection of hydrophobicity profiles, using database annotations and previous analyses of TM sequences as a guide ([28], M. Hemler, unpublished), and aligned manually. Residue numbers in <span class="yellow">human</span> CD9 sequence are used a reference point throughout the study.<br><br>DNA cloning and mutagenesis
Sequence encoding CD9 protein was cloned into vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), for expression of untagged and C-terminally GFP-tagged CD9, respectively. pEGFP-N1 encoding CD9 TM(1+2) -GFP fusion protein was constructed by subcloning DNA for residues 1–83 of CD9 into HindIII and PstI sites of the vector; to introduce the PstI site, codon GTG for Val82 was changed to CTG (coding for Ala). In the resulting fusion protein, there is a 13-amino acid linker (with no cysteines) between CD9 and GFP. To minimize the low inherent ability of GFP to homodimerize, which could potentially influence the results of CD9 cross-linking, we used a monomeric GFP mutant, Leu221→Lys [34], for cross-linking experiments.
Mutations were introduced in full-length and TM(1+2) CD9 proteins by a PCR-based strategy using mutagenic primers and Pfu DNA polymerase. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.<br><br>Protein expression, microscopy, cysteine disulfide cross-linking and Western blotting
DNA constructs encoding TM(1+2)-GFP or full-length CD9 proteins were transfected into <span class="yellow">human</span> rhabdomyosarcoma RD cells using the FuGENE 6 reagent. Cells expressing GFP fusion proteins were analysed by fluorescence microscopy 18–28 hours post-transfection. Images were captured using Spot 1.4.0 camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI) attached to Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope.
For experiments involving cysteine-mediated cross-linking, cells were treated with 50 μM 2-BP starting 24–26 hours post-transfection and continuing for 16–18 hours. Cross-linking was carried out by incubating cells in HBSM buffer (25 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2) containing either a) 0.6 mM CuSO4 and 1.8 mM 1,10-phenanthroline (CuP complex) or b) 0.2 mg/ml homobifunctional cysteine-reactive cross-linker (e.g. DTME), diluted from fresh 10 mg/ml solution in DMSO. After incubation for 10–15 minutes (with CuP) or 30–45 minutes (with cross-linker), cells were washed twice for 10 minutes with HBSM containing 10 mM NEM to block residual free cysteines. Cells were lysed in HBSM containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS and a cocktail of protease inhibitors with 1 mM EDTA at 4°C for 45–60 minutes. Cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 minutes, an aliquot was removed, and proteins from it were precipitated by addition of trichloroacetic acid to 10% on ice followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 minutes. After two washes with ice-cold acetone, protein pellet was solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer without a reducing agent (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 8% glycerol).
In some experiments, CD9 protein was immunoprecipitated using monoclonal antibody Alb6 (Immunotech, Marseille, France). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using monoclonal antibody JL-8 (Clontech) for GFP or Alb6 for CD9. Bands from X-ray films were quantitated using GeneTools™ software from Syngene (Frederick, MD).<br><br>Modeling of TM1-TM2 interaction
An atomic model of the CD9 TM1-TM2 dimer was constructed with a Monte Carlo-simulated annealing (MCSA) algorithm [69]. Two idealized α-helices corresponding to TM1 residues Tyr12 through Leu35 and TM2 residues Gly59 through Val82 were docked with six orthogonal parameters: three rigid body translations and three rotations. During each step of a MCSA cycle, there was an equal probability of changing either one parameter or all six parameters to random values. A conformation's energy was calculated in vacuo with the AMBER united-atom force field for van der Waals interactions [70]. The van der Waals term was modified as described by Kuhlman and Baker [71]. If a structure had favorable dimerization energy, the energies of select mutants were calculated. Structures were selected with a novel scoring function that maximizes the Boltzmann probability of dimerization for silent mutations while minimizing the probability for disruptive mutations. Asn18Ser, Gly77Leu, and Gly80Leu were scored as silent mutations while Gly25Leu, Gly32Leu, Gly67Leu, and Gly74Leu were considered to be disruptive. Each MCSA cycle consisted of 50,000 steps with an exponential temperature decay from 10,000 to 10 K.
Ten MCSA cycles through global sample space were used to restrict the search area. Parameters were restricted to ± 2 standard deviations from their mean value for structures within 10 kcal of the best structure. MCSA cycles were repeated as described above with additional optimization of χ values: rotamers at the protein-protein interface were optimized with Dead End Elimination [72], and χ values were further optimized with Monte Carlo. All MCSA cycles converged upon structures that were within a root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of 1.5 Å with the best structure, and structures that scored within 5 kcal of the best score had an RMSD of less than 0.5 Å with the best structure.<br><br>

<h3>pmcA140510</h3>Enp1, a <span class="yellow">yeast</span> protein associated with U3 and U14 snoRNAs, is required for pre-rRNA processing and 40S subunit synthesis
Abstract
ENP1 is an essential <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> gene encoding a 483 amino acid polypeptide. Enp1 protein is localized in the nucleus and concentrated in the nucleolus. An enp1-1 temperature-sensitive mutant inhibited 35S pre-rRNA early processing at sites A0, A1 and A2 as shown by northern analysis of steady state levels of rRNA precursors. Pulse-chase analysis further revealed that the enp1-1 strain was defective in the synthesis of 20S pre-rRNA and hence 18S rRNA, which led to reduced formation of 40S ribosomal subunits. Co-precipitation analysis revealed that Enp1 was associated with Nop1 protein, as well as with U3 and U14 RNAs, two snoRNAs implicated in early pre-rRNA processing steps. These results suggest a direct role for Enp1 in the early steps of rRNA processing.<br><br>INTRODUCTION
Ribosome biogenesis is one of the major cellular activities in eukaryotic cells. It takes place primarily in a specialized subnuclear compartment, the nucleolus (1,2). In the <span class="yellow">yeast</span> <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, each rRNA gene is transcribed by RNA polymerase I into a 35S rRNA precursor, consisting of 18S, 5.8S and 25S rRNA sequences flanked by two external transcribed spacers (ETS) and separated by two internal transcribed spacers (ITS) (Fig. 1). This 35S precursor goes through a series of modifications and processing steps to generate the mature 18S, 5.8S and 25S rRNAs. The processing occurs first at sites A0, A1 and A2, resulting in the 20S pre-rRNA and 27SA2 pre-rRNA. The 20S pre-rRNA is then cleaved, leading to the mature 18S rRNA found in the 40S ribosomal subunit. The 27SA2 pre-rRNA is processed through two alternative pathways. The majority of 27SA2 pre-rRNA is cleaved at sites A3 and B2 to form the 27SA3 pre-rRNA, which is subsequently processed to produce 27SBS. Alternatively, 27SA2 pre-rRNA can be processed at sites B1L and B2 to generate 27SBL pre-rRNA. Both 27SBS and 27SBL pre-rRNAs are then cleaved at sites C1 and C2 to generate the mature 25S rRNA, and 7SS or 7SL intermediates, which are then processed to mature 5.8SS or 5.8SL rRNAs (Fig. 1). The 25S rRNA and 5.8S rRNA are the RNA components of the 60S ribosomal subunit (3). During the course of rRNA modification and processing, many of the ribosomal proteins are assembled onto the rRNA molecules to form the ribosome complex.
Ribosome biogenesis needs a large number of trans-acting factors, including small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), protein components of the snoRNP complexes, rRNA modifying enzymes, endo- and exonucleases, putative RNA helicases and other protein factors (3,4). In <span class="yellow">yeast</span> cells there are more than 100 different snoRNAs playing important roles in rRNA modification and processing. On the basis of their structure, the snoRNAs can be divided into two groups: the box C/D family and box H/ACA family. Only one snoRNA, MRP RNA, belongs to neither family (5–7). While the majority of the snoRNAs participate in RNA pseudouridylation and 2′-O-ribose methylation, a few of them, including MRP snoRNA, box C/D snoRNAs U3 and U14, and box H/ACA snoRNAs snR10 and snR30, are required for processing of the pre-rRNA (8–12). Not only are U3, U14, snR10 and snR30 essential for early cleavages of 35S pre-rRNA to 18S rRNA, the proteins associated with them, including Nop1, Nop5, Gar1 and Nop10, have also been shown to be required for 18S rRNA synthesis (13–16).
The ENP1 (Essential Nuclear Protein 1) gene was identified in a genetic screen for suppressors of an ost4 mutation (oligosaccharide transferase 4) (17). However, in subsequent studies it was found not to be involved in OST4 function (18). ENP1 is an essential gene encoding a 483 amino acid polypeptide. The Enp1 protein is highly conserved and homologs are found in all eukaryotes. The <span class="yellow">yeast</span> protein was localized to the nucleus in a previous study (18). On the other hand, an Enp1 <span class="yellow">human</span> homolog, called bystin, was reported to localize to the cytoplasm and was proposed to be involved in cell adhesion (19).
In this study, we report that the Enp1 protein not only is nuclear but is enriched in the nucleolus. We also found that Enp1 is required for the synthesis of 40S ribosomal subunits, and its presence is necessary for the pre-rRNA processing to form 20S pre-rRNA and 18S rRNA. An association between Enp1 and U3 and U14 snoRNAs, and with the nucleolar protein Nop1, was established. We also found that <span class="yellow">human</span> Enp1, expressed in <span class="yellow">yeast</span>, was located in the nucleus and the nucleolus, suggesting that the function of this protein is conserved.<br><br>MATERIALS AND METHODS
<span class="yellow">Yeast</span> strains and media
The <span class="yellow">S.cerevisiae</span> strains used in this study are all derivatives of a wild-type diploid strain W303 (MATa/MATα ura3-1/ura3-1 leu2-3,112/leu2-3,112 trp1-1/trp1-1 his3-11,15/his3-11,15 ade2-1/ade2-1 can1-100/can1-100) except for strain RS1938. Strain JBY45 (MATa/MATα ENP1/Δenp1::his5+) was constructed by replacing one copy of the ENP1 open reading frame (ORF) with the <span class="yellow">Schizosaccharomyces pombe</span> his5+ gene (18). Strain JBY46 [MATa Δenp1::his5+/pJB23 (ENP1, URA3, CEN6)] is a haploid strain derived from JBY45 with wild-type ENP1 on a low copy number plasmid. Strain JBY48 [MATa Δenp1::his5+/pJB19 (enp1-1, TRP1, CEN6)] and strain JBY49 [MATa Δenp1::his5+/pJB39 (enp1-2, TRP1, CEN6)] have plasmids with enp1 temperature-sensitive (ts) mutations. Strain JBY51 (MATa Δenp1::his5+ TRP1::enp1-1) is an enp1 ts strain generated by integrating the enp1-1 gene at the chromosomal trp1-1 locus. Strain CWY13 [MATa Δenp1::his5+/pJB24 (pMET25-GFP-ENP1, URA3, CEN6)] has GFP-ENP1 under control of the MET25 promoter. Strain CWY14 (MATa ENP1-TAP) was created by fusing sequences encoding a Tandem Affinity Purification (TAP) tag (20,21) to the 3′ end of ENP1. Strain YRH39 (MATα HST2-TAP) was created by fusing sequences encoding a TAP tag to the 3′end of HST2. Strain RS1938 (Δnop1::URA3 pUN100-ProtA-NOP1) was created by transforming RS1935 (MATa/α leu2/leu2 ura3/ura3 lys2/lys2 ade2/ade2 Δnop1::URA3/NOP1) with pUN100-ProtA-NOP1 (strain and plasmid supplied by T. Schafer), followed by tetrad dissection. Strain CWY15 [MATa/pCW109 (pMET25-GFP-hENP1, URA3, CEN6)] has a <span class="yellow">human</span> homolog of Enp1 expressed in W303-1a. The media used were prepared as described (22).<br><br>Cloning of ENP1
pRS426-MEG1 (The original name of ENP1) was a gift from Dr William J. Lennarz. It contains the ENP1 gene within a 2.6 kb EcoRI genomic fragment cloned into pRS426 (18). The EcoRI fragment was subsequently cloned into pRS314 (TRP1, CEN6), pRS316 (URA3, CEN6) and pRS424 (TRP1, 2µ) to create pJB20, pJB23 and pJB21, respectively. pGFP-N-FUS is a centromeric plasmid for fusing green fluorescence protein (GFP) to a polypeptide’s N-terminus under control of the MET25 promoter (23). Cloning the ENP1 ORF into pGFP-N-FUS via XbaI and SalI sites generated plasmid pJB24. pJB19 (enp1-1, TRP1, CEN6) contains the enp1-1 mutant gene. The <span class="yellow">human</span> homolog of <span class="yellow">yeast</span> Enp1 was PCR amplified from a <span class="yellow">human</span> cDNA clone BC007340 (Research Genetics), then cloned into pGFP-N-FUS, p415-ADH, p415-GPD and p415-TEF (24) via XbaI and SalI sites to generate pCW109, pCW113, pCW115 and pCW117, respectively. The fragment of the <span class="yellow">human</span> Enp1 homolog (amino acids 152–437) was also cloned into these vectors to generate pCW110, pCW114, pCW116 and pCW118.<br><br>Random mutagenesis of ENP1 to generate enp1 ts mutants
The enp1 ts mutants were generated with a protocol introducing random mutations by PCR (25). The PCR was performed with oligonucleotides ENP1-MUT5′ (5′-GGTGGTGTCAGT AGGGGA-3′), ENP1-MUT3′ (5′-CAGTCTGCAATATA TGGAC-3′) and plasmid template pJB20 (see above). The nucleotide concentrations in the reaction were 1 mM each for dATP, dGTP, dCTP and dTTP. After strain JBY46 was transformed with the PCR product and with pJB20 gapped by NheI and NsiI, the transformants were replica-plated onto two plates containing 5-FOA synthetic medium without tryptophan; one replica was incubated at 23°C and the other at 37°C. Colonies growing at 23°C but not at 37°C were picked as candidates. Since approximately 10% of the colonies were inviable at both temperatures, we knew that 10% of the ENP1 PCR products lost their function after the PCR mutagenesis. This confirmed the effectiveness of the mutagenesis procedure. Two candidates showed good growth at 23°C but no growth at 37°C. They were named strains JBY48 and JBY49 and contained plasmids with the enp1-1 and enp1-2 mutations, respectively. The mutated enp1-1 gene on pJB19 was cloned into an integration vector, pRS304, as an EcoRI fragment. The plasmid was subsequently linearized with SnaBI within the TRP1 marker and was integrated at the chromosomal trp1-1 locus of strain JBY46. Selection on 5-FOA was used to remove plasmid pJB23, creating strain JBY51.<br><br>Sucrose gradient analysis
Polyribosome preparation and analysis were carried out essentially as described (26). Cells grown in YPD were collected at mid-log phase (OD600 0.8–1.0) and were broken with glass beads. The lysate was frozen immediately in liquid N2 and was stored at –80°C. Lysate (30 U of absorbance at OD260) was layered over a 7–47% (w/v) sucrose gradient, which was centrifuged at 28 000 r.p.m. for 5 h at 4°C in a SW28 rotor and was analyzed with an ISCO UA-5 gradient UV detection system on absorbency at 254 nm.<br><br>Immunofluorescence
Immunofluorescence analysis was carried out essentially as described (27). Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde at room temperature for 1.5 h. Antibodies included a <span class="yellow">mouse</span> monoclonal anti-Nop1 (a gift from John P. Aris, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida) and a Texas-red-conjugated <span class="yellow">donkey</span>-anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> antibody (Jackson Lab), both used at 1:500 dilution. Images were taken on a Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope equipped with a Zeiss AxioCam camera.<br><br>Pulse-chase labeling analysis of rRNA
For [methyl-3H]methionine pulse-chase analysis, cells were grown in synthetic medium without methionine at room temperature or 37°C for 2 h. When the OD600 reached 1.0, 6 ml of the culture were pulse-labeled with 250 µCi [methyl-3H]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia) for 3 min and chased with cold methionine (500 µg/ml) for 2, 4 or 12 min. For each time point of the chase 1.25 ml of culture was mixed with ice and collected. The pellets were frozen immediately in liquid N2 and stored at –80°C before total RNA was purified using a hot phenol method (28). The RNAs were separated on a 1.2% agarose formaldehyde gel and transferred onto Hybond-N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia). After being sprayed with EN3HANCE (Du Pont), the membranes were exposed to film at –80°C (29).<br><br>Northern analysis
Cells were grown inYPD at room temperature or 37°C for 2–4 h. When the OD600 reached 1.0, 10 ml of cells were collected and frozen immediately. Total RNA was extracted as described (28). Five micrograms of RNA were separated on 1.2% agarose formaldehyde gels (for high molecular weight RNA) or on 6% polyacrylamide 7 M urea denaturing gels (for low molecular weight RNA) for each sample. The RNA was then transferred to Zeta-Probe GT nylon membranes (Bio-Rad). Probes for hybridyzation were specific oligonucleotides end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP. After hybridization and washes, membranes were exposed to phosphorimager screens or X-ray films (29). Oligonucleotides specific for various regions of 35S pre-rRNA are: 1, GGTCTCTCTGCTGCCG GAAATG; 3, AATGAGCCATTCGCAGTTTCACTG; 4, GCTCTCATGCTCTTGCCAAAAC; 5, TGTTTGTTACCT CTGGGCCCCG; 6, TCCAGTTACGAAAATTCTTG; 7, CGTATCGCATTTCGCTGCGTTC; 8, GTTCGCCTAGAC GCTCTCTCTTC; 9, GCGAGATTCCCCTACCCAC. The regions complementary to these oligonucleotides are shown in Figure 6A. The oligonucleotides probing box C/D snoRNAs are: U3, TTCGGTTTCTCACTCACTCTGGGGTAC; U14, GGAACCAGTCTTTCATCACCGTG. The oligonucleotides probing box H/ACA snoRNAs are: snoRNA10, CCTTG CAACGGTCCTCATCCGGG; snoRNA30, GTCCGAAGC GCCATCTAGATGA.<br><br>RNA and protein precipitation analysis
Cells were grown in YPD (1 l) to OD600 1.0, then collected, washed once in ice-cold PBS and broken using glass beads in 10 ml IPP150 buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% NP-40) with protease inhibitors. The lysates were mixed with 200 µl IgG agarose beads for 2 h at 4°C. After several washes with 50 ml IPP150 buffer, the IgG beads were collected and the RNA associated with the beads extracted by the hot phenol method (28). One-tenth of the precipitated RNA was then separated on 6% polyacrylamide 7 M urea denaturing gels and electro-transferred to Zeta-Probe GT nylon membranes. They were probed with [γ-32P]ATP labeled oligonucleotides. For the lanes showing total RNA, 2 µg RNA prepared from exponentially growing cultures were loaded. For co-precipitation analysis of proteins, the IgG beads were resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min and separated by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Approximately 1% of the precipitate was loaded onto each lane. For the total protein, 0.1% of the extract prior to precipitation was loaded onto each lane. Following electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and detected using anti-Nop1 antibody at 1:3000 dilution (provided by J. Aris) and anti-L3 antibody (provided by J. Warner) at 1:3000 dilution followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> secondary antibody at 1:5000 dilution. The antibody complexes were detected using ECL-Plus reagents (Amersham Pharmacia) as specified by the manufacturer.<br><br>
RESULTS
Construction and analysis of ENP1 temperature-sensitive alleles
ENP1 is an essential <span class="yellow">yeast</span> gene conserved among eukaryotes (18). To study its functions, we first created a diploid strain, JBY45, heterozygous for the Δenp1 mutation. Then two enp1 ts mutant alleles (enp1-1 and enp1-2) were generated by random PCR mutagenesis, as described in Materials and Methods. Both mutant alleles were recessive to the wild-type ENP1 gene. The enp1-1 gene was integrated into the chromosomal trp1-1 locus to create strain JBY51 and all subsequent experiments were done with this enp1 allele. At 23°C the growth of JBY51 was comparable to that of W303-1a (ENP1), but at 37°C it did not grow (Fig. 2). Sequence analysis revealed that enp1-1 contains two point mutations, resulting in substitutions of two amino acids: W242→G and V415→A. No attempt was made to determine whether both mutations were required for the ts phenotype. Flow cytometry of strain JBY51 showed DNA content profiles similar to those of the wild-type strain at the non-permissive temperature (data not shown), suggesting that ENP1 is not involved in cell cycle regulation.<br><br>Enp1 is enriched in the nucleolus
Enp1 tagged at the C-terminus with the myc epitope was previously found to localize to the nucleus (18). To expand this analysis, we fused GFP to the N-terminus of Enp1, and expressed the tagged Enp1 protein under control of the MET25 promoter as the sole source of Enp1 protein in the cells. Cells of strain CWY13 (pMET25-GFP-ENP1) were grown in media with methionine (transcription partially repressed) or without methionine (transcription not repressed). Growth of CWY13 was comparable to that of wild-type cells in both media (data not shown), indicating that the GFP tagged Enp1 protein was functional. In cells cultured in medium without methionine, in which the ENP transcription was not repressed, the GFP-Enp1 protein was expressed at a high level and showed strong green fluorescence distributed throughout the nucleus (data not shown), consistent with the original observation (18). With methionine added to the medium, however, the fluorescent signal of GFP-Enp1 was weaker and surprisingly showed crescent or cap-like patterns typical of nucleolar proteins (Fig. 3A). This nucleolar enrichment was confirmed by its co-localization with the nucleolar protein Nop1 (Fig. 3B).<br><br>ENP1 mutation leads to reduced levels of 40S ribosomal subunits
The nucleolar enrichment suggested that Enp1 might play some role in ribosome synthesis. To test this possibility, cells of W303-1a (ENP1), JBY51 (enp1-1) and a top2 ts strain RS191 (30) were grown in YPD at 23 or 37°C and their ribosome profiles analyzed after separation on sucrose gradients. At 23°C, enp1-1 cells showed polysome profiles similar to those of the wild-type and top2-1 strains (Fig. 4A–C). In contrast, after incubation at the non-permissive temperature (37°C) for 40 min (data not shown) and 2 h, enp1-1 cells had reduced levels of 40S ribosomal subunits, 80S monosomes and polysomes, along with a dramatic increase in the free 60S subunit peak (Fig. 4F), while the wild-type and top2-1 cells showed little change in polysome profile at 37°C (Fig. 4D and E). These results demonstrate that the changes of the enp1-1 polysome profile were due to specific defects caused by the enp1-1 mutation, and not due simply to the shift to 37°C for a wild-type or ts strain.<br><br>The processing of pre-rRNA for 18S rRNA is impaired in enp1 mutants
In most cases reductions in ribosomal subunit levels are the results of defects in pre-rRNA processing or ribosome assembly or both (3). To study the mechanism by which Enp1 affects the 40S subunit, we analyzed the effects of enp1 mutations on processing of the pre-rRNA using pulse-chase labeling. [methyl-3H]methionine is preferred for labeling rRNAs in pulse-chase analysis because rRNAs are specifically methylated during the early steps of the processing. Cells of W303-1a (ENP1) and JBY51 (enp1-1) were grown at 23 or 37°C for 2 h before they were labeled with [methyl-3H]methionine for 3 min and chased with cold methionine for 2, 4 and 12 min. In wild-type cells, the labeled 35S rRNA precursor, 27S and 20S rRNA intermediates were rapidly chased into mature 25S and 18S rRNAs (Fig. 5), at 23 or 37°C. In contrast, enp1-1 cells showed dramatic changes after incubation at 37°C. Although at 23°C the synthesis and processing were comparable to those of wild-type cells, cells cultured at 37°C for 2 h had neither 20S pre-rRNA nor 18S rRNA, while 25S rRNA was generated at normal levels. The 37°C grown enp1-1 cells also had low levels of aberrant 23S and possibly 21S intermediates (Fig. 5). The defect in 18S rRNA synthesis was further supported by pulse-chase experiments carried out using [5,6-3H]uracil. The results obtained were essentially the same; no 20S pre-rRNA or 18S rRNA was produced, while processing to 25S rRNA was not affected (data not shown).
Taken together, these results suggested that the enp1 mutation leads to specific defects in the processing pathway for 20S pre-rRNA and 18S rRNA, resulting in reduced 40S subunit synthesis and a lowered level of the 40S subunit.<br><br>Enp1 is required for pre-rRNA processing at A0, A1 and A2 sites
To define the processing steps affected by the enp1 mutation, the steady state levels of rRNA precursors and mature RNAs were analyzed by northern blotting. Total RNAs were isolated from cells of W303-1a (ENP1) and JBY51 (enp1-1) grown at 37°C for 2 or 4 h. After separation on formaldehyde agarose, RNAs were transferred onto nylon membranes and probed with radiolabeled oligonucleotides specific to various regions of the 35S pre-rRNA (Fig. 6A). After incubation at 37°C, enp1-1 cells had wild-type levels of 25S rRNA, but reduced levels of 18S rRNA (Fig. 6B). A probe specific to ITS1 (P5) further revealed that enp1-1 cells incubated at the non-permissive temperature accumulated two aberrant rRNAs, 23S and 21S (Fig. 6C). Aberrant rRNA processing products of similar sizes have been described in numerous studies (14,31–34) and result from defects in processing at A0, A1 and A2. Additional probes were used to verify the origins of the 23S and 21S RNAs in the enp1-1 strain. The 23S product was detected by oligos 1, 2, 4 and 5, but not by oligos 6, 7 or 8 (Fig. 6D, E, C, F, G and data not shown). Thus this RNA extends from the 5′ end of the 35S rRNA to the A3 site. The 21S product was detected by oligos 4 and 5, but not by oligos 1, 2, 6, 7 and 8 (Fig. 6E, C, D, F, G and data not shown), indicating that it extends from the A1 to the A3 site. At 37°C the enp1-1 cells also had less 32S and 20S rRNA intermediates (Fig. 6B and E). These results suggest that the enp1 mutation led to complete or nearly complete inhibition of processing at site A0 and A2, and partial inhibition of processing at site A1. As a consequence, the 35S pre-rRNA was cleaved at site A3 instead, producing 23S and 21S rRNA products. Consistent with this theory, the 27SA2 rRNA intermediate level was greatly reduced in enp1 cells at 37°C (Fig. 6C) due to the inhibition of processing at A2, while the 27SB pre-rRNA level was similar to wild-type cells (Fig. 6G). Moreover, no difference in the 5.8 rRNA level was observed between the wild-type cells and enp1 cells (Fig. 6H).<br><br>Enp1 is associated with U3 and U14 snoRNAs and with Nop1
It has previously been shown that mutations in the U3, U14, snR10 and snR30 snoRNAs and in their associated proteins affect processing of 35S pre-rRNA at A0, A1 and A2. Because of the similarity with the processing defects of enp1-1 strains, we tested the association between Enp1 and snoRNAs. To do this, we created a strain in which a TAP tag was fused to the C-terminus of Enp1. The TAP tag contains <span class="yellow">Staphylococcus aureus</span> Protein A as well as calmodulin-binding peptide sequences, so the tagged Enp1 binds IgG beads with high specificity. Cells grew well with the TAP-tagged Enp1 as the only source of Enp1 protein, showing that it was functional. As a control, we used a TAP tag on an unrelated cytoplasmic protein, Hst2. Strain CWY14 (ENP1-TAP) and the Hst2-TAP tagged strain were grown in YPD to mid-exponential phase before being harvested. Extracts were prepared and mixed with IgG agarose beads to precipitate Enp1-TAP and associated RNAs. Total RNAs were extracted from washed IgG beads, separated on 6% polyacrylamide denaturing gels, transferred to nylon membranes and probed with radiolabeled oligonucleotides. Northern analysis revealed that Enp1-TAP precipitates were enriched with U3 and U14 snoRNAs relative to precipitates from the Hst2-tagged strain (Fig. 7A). The Enp1-TAP samples were not enriched with snR30 snoRNA (Fig. 7A), nor with U24 or U18 snoRNAs (data not shown). We found no change in the levels of U3, U14, snR10 and snR30 snoRNAs in the enp1 mutant, indicating that the mutation did not affect snoRNAs levels (Fig. 6I). The results indicate that Enp1 associates in vivo with U3 and U14 snoRNAs. Much less U3 RNA co-immunoprecipitated with Enp1-TAP than with Protein A-tagged Nop1, which is known to associate with U3 and U14 snoRNAs (Fig. 7A). However, Protein A-Nop1 was much more efficiently precipitated than was the Enp1-TAP protein (data not shown). Therefore, it is likely that similar amounts of RNAs are associated with the two proteins and that the proteins are part of the same complex. To address this further, we checked for the presence of Nop1 in the Enp1-TAP immunoprecipitates. Figure 7B shows that Nop1 indeed is in the Enp1 precipitate but not in the Hst2 control, whereas an abundant ribosomal protein, L3, is in neither precipitate.
U3 and U14 snoRNAs have been shown to interact with rRNA precursors and these interactions are required for pre-rRNA processing (35–37). Using an in vitro system, U3 was also shown to be associated with its rRNA substrate and processing product (38). This raised the possibility that Enp1 might also be associated with rRNAs since its function in rRNA processing appeared linked to those of U3 and U14 snoRNAs. To test this possibility, we further analyzed the RNAs that co-precipiate with TAP-tagged Enp1. The RNAs were separated on 1.2% agarose formaldehyde gels or on polyacrylamide denaturing gels, transferred to nylon membranes and probed with radiolabeled oligonucleotides for pre-rRNAs. A probe (P4; see Fig. 6) specific to 20s and its precursors revealed that pre-rRNAs 35S, 33S, 32S and 20S specifically co-precipitated with Enp1-TAP (Fig. 7C). No such enrichment was found using a probe (P8; see Fig. 6) specific for 27S RNAs or a probe for 5.8S RNA (Fig. 7C). These results clearly demonstrated that Enp1 is associated with substrates and products of the early steps of 18S rRNA processing.<br><br>Comparison of Enp1 with homologs in other organisms
Homologs of Enp1 protein in <span class="yellow">human</span>, <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> and <span class="blue">Caenorhabditis elegans</span> have been reported (18). A previously described <span class="yellow">human</span> homolog, bystin, was only 306 amino acids in length, and lacked sequences corresponding to the N-terminal 163 amino acids of <span class="yellow">yeast</span> Enp1 (19). In contrast, we identified a <span class="yellow">human</span> expressed sequence tag (EST), BC007340 in a Blast search that revealed an ORF of 1311 nucleotides encoding a 437 amino acid polypeptide (39). Comparison of this 437 amino acid polypeptide with <span class="yellow">human</span> bystin (19) showed that they were encoded by the same gene on <span class="yellow">human</span> chromosome 6. The reported sequence for <span class="yellow">human</span> bystin is a fragment of the 437 amino acid <span class="yellow">human</span> Enp1 protein, due to a truncated cDNA sequence. Also, a sequence discrepancy at the C-terminus is due to inaccurate DNA sequence of the <span class="yellow">human</span> bystin, as confirmed by available <span class="yellow">human</span> genome and EST sequences. Searches of the database of other organisms identified Enp1 homologs in <span class="yellow">S.pombe</span>, <span class="yellow">Arabidopsis thaliana</span>, <span class="yellow">C.elegans</span>, <span class="yellow">Drosophila melanogaster</span> and <span class="yellow">mouse</span>. The alignment of the homologs showed that they shared homology from the N-terminus to the C-terminus, with the C-terminal half extremely well conserved, with close to 90% similarity (Fig. 8). One interesting observation is that the two amino acids changed in the enp1-1 mutant, W242 and V415, are conserved among all homologs.
The <span class="yellow">human</span> Enp1 homolog was cloned and expressed in <span class="yellow">yeast</span> and tested for function. Expressed under the control of ADH, TEF or GPD promoter, the <span class="yellow">human</span> Enp1 homolog did not complement a <span class="yellow">yeast</span> enp1 null mutant. However, a GFP fusion to the N-terminus of <span class="yellow">human</span> Enp1 homolog localized to the nucleus and was enriched in the nucleolus (data not shown).<br><br>
DISCUSSION
ENP1 is a <span class="yellow">yeast</span> gene first identified in a genetic screen for complementation of mutations in ost4, which encodes a subunit of oligosaccharide transferase (17), although subsequent work showed that it is unlikely that Enp1 has any connection to oligosaccharide transferase (18). ENP1 was shown to be essential for viability and the Enp1 protein localized to the nucleus (18).
When we re-examined the localization of Enp1, we observed that the protein was enriched in the nucleolus. This finding led us to test for a role of Enp1 in ribosome synthesis. Using an enp1 ts mutant, we found that depletion of Enp1 caused a 40S ribosomal subunit deficiency. Further analysis revealed that this deficiency was not due to a change of the subunit’s stability, but to a defect in the synthesis of the subunit’s 18S rRNA component. Pulse-chase analysis of RNA synthesis in an enp1-1 strain revealed that no 20S pre-rRNA or 18S rRNA was made at the non-permissive temperature, while levels of 25S rRNA appeared normal. Low levels of precursors to 18S rRNA were detected in the mutants, and they were extremely unstable. Northern analysis of steady state RNA levels demonstrated that the enp1 mutation specifically inhibited the pre-rRNA early cleavages at sites A0, A1 and A2, which are required for the production of the 20S pre-rRNA and the 18S rRNA. These defects of the enp1 mutation on rRNA processing are very similar to those caused by mutation of KRR1, another essential nucleolar gene required for synthesis of the 40S, but not the 60S subunit (40).
Co-precipitation analyses provided strong evidence that Enp1 is directly involved in pre-rRNA processing. In these experiments, TAP-tagged Enp1 bound to IgG beads specifically co-precipitated with two snoRNAs, U3 and U14, and with the 35S, 33S, 32S and 20S pre-rRNAs. Among the more than 100 snoRNAs in <span class="yellow">yeast</span> cells, U3, U14, snR10, snR30 and MRP RNA are the only ones required for rRNA processing. It has been shown that mutations in U3, U14, snR10 and snR30 snoRNAs and protein components of the snoRNPs affect processing at sites A0, A1 or A2 (15,16,41,42). Enp1’s interaction with U3 and U14 snoRNAs suggests that Enp1’s function in rRNA processing involves these two snoRNAs. The fact that the nucleolar protein, Nop1, known to bind to U3 and U14 RNAs, also was found in the Enp1 precipitate, provides additional evidence that Enp1 is part of a complex involved in processing of rRNA. Recently, a genome-wide study of <span class="yellow">yeast</span> protein complexes, using a TAP tag method similar to ours, reported a number of proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with Enp1 (43). These proteins included Imp4, Kre31, Kre33, Mpp10, Nop1, Nop14 and Sof1, all of which have been implicated in 18S RNA processing or 40S biogenesis. Very recently (after the studies in this manuscript were concluded) Grandi et al. published an analysis of components of the 90s preribosomal particle, which include the 35S pre-rRNA, U3 snoRNP and rRNA processing factors for the 40S subunit (44). In agreement with our findings, they found that Enp1 is a component of this 90s complex and also of a smaller complex containing the 20S pre-rRNA. Surprisingly, none of the other proteins involved in processing of pre-rRNAs that were tested associated with the 20S rRNA, suggesting that those proteins, but not Enp1, are released prior to 20S pre-rRNA formation (44). The authors also showed co-precipitation of Enp1 with dimethylated 20S pre-rRNA, which is formed after export of 20S to the cytoplasm. These results of Grandi et al. suggest that Enp1 may also be involved in later steps of processing or nuclear export.
A previous study on the Enp1 <span class="yellow">human</span> homolog, bystin, reported that the protein was localized in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells and might be involved in cell adhesion (19). Our discovery of the 437 amino acid <span class="yellow">human</span> Enp1 homolog revealed that the bystin studied previously was from a truncated library cDNA encoding only the C-terminal 306 amino acids. Although the <span class="yellow">human</span> homolog of Enp1 did not complement a <span class="yellow">yeast</span> Δenp1 mutant, we did show that it was localized to the nucleus and enriched in the nucleolus (data not shown). This strongly suggests that the conserved function of Enp1 is in rRNA processing. The cytoplasmic localization of bystin and its proposed function in cell adhesion are unlikely to reflect the actual function of the <span class="yellow">human</span> Enp1 homolog.
It will be important to study the nature of the associations between Enp1 and U3 and U14 snoRNPs, and to learn more about the exact role of Enp1 in ribosomal RNA processing.<br><br>
<h3>pmcA1937013</h3>Dynein Modifiers in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>: Light Chains Suppress Conditional Heavy Chain Mutants
Abstract
Cytoplasmic dynein is a microtubule-dependent motor protein that functions in mitotic cells during centrosome separation, metaphase chromosome congression, anaphase spindle elongation, and chromosome segregation. Dynein is also utilized during interphase for vesicle transport and organelle positioning. While numerous cellular processes require cytoplasmic dynein, the mechanisms that target and regulate this microtubule motor remain largely unknown. By screening a conditional <span class="blue">Caenorhabditis elegans</span> cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain mutant at a semipermissive temperature with a genome-wide RNA interference library to reduce gene functions, we have isolated and characterized twenty dynein-specific suppressor genes. When reduced in function, these genes suppress dynein mutants but not other conditionally mutant loci, and twelve of the 20 specific suppressors do not exhibit sterile or lethal phenotypes when their function is reduced in wild-type <span class="yellow">worms</span>. Many of the suppressor proteins, including two dynein light chains, localize to subcellular sites that overlap with those reported by others for the dynein heavy chain. Furthermore, knocking down any one of four putative dynein accessory chains suppresses the conditional heavy chain mutants, suggesting that some accessory chains negatively regulate heavy chain function. We also identified 29 additional genes that, when reduced in function, suppress conditional mutations not only in dynein but also in loci required for unrelated essential processes. In conclusion, we have identified twenty genes that in many cases are not essential themselves but are conserved and when reduced in function can suppress conditionally lethal <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain mutants. We conclude that conserved but nonessential genes contribute to dynein function during the essential process of mitosis.
Microtubules and microtubule-dependent motor proteins segregate chromosomes during mitosis and also promote cellular organization in nondividing cells. An essential motor protein complex called cytoplasmic dynein powers many aspects of microtubule-dependent transport, but it is currently unclear how dynein is regulated such that it can execute different processes. We have performed a genome-wide screen to isolate genes that are involved in dynein-dependent processes. We determined that 20 of the 49 genes we identified specifically influenced the viability of dynein mutant strains but not the viability of other <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> mutants. Many of the proteins that specifically influence dynein localized to subcellular sites where the dynein heavy chain has been reported by others to be found. Additionally, we identified four dynein components that appear to negatively regulate the force-generating dynein heavy chain. The identification and initial characterization of this group of genes represents a route to identify genes that are not themselves essential but do participate in essential processes.<br><br><br><br>Introduction
The microtubule motor called cytoplasmic dynein has roles in diverse cellular processes including meiotic and mitotic spindle assembly and function, neuronal transport, and organelle positioning [1]. Cytoplasmic dynein is composed of a dimer of heavy chains (HCs), along with several accessory chains (ACs: intermediate, light intermediate, and light chains). Other dynein-interacting proteins, such as dynactin and LIS1, are likely present at substoichiometric levels and further modulate dynein function. The HCs contain both ATPase and microtubule binding activities and are sufficient for microtubule-based motility in vitro, moving toward the minus, or slow-growing, end of microtubules [2]. The dynein ACs provide cargo docking sites and often are encoded by multigene families in any one species [reviewed in 1,3]. In <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>, a single gene called dhc-1 encodes a cytoplasmic dynein 1 HC, while 11 other genes encode five classes of predicted dynein ACs [3,4].
The early <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> embryo is an excellent system for investigating gene contributions for essential cellular processes, including cytoskeletal functions [5]. The <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> dynein HC DHC-1 is essential and required for multiple microtubule-dependent events during early embryogenesis [6–9]. Depletion of DHC-1 by RNA interference (RNAi) in early <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> embryos produces defects in female meiotic divisions, migration of the oocyte and sperm pronuclei after fertilization, and centrosome separation during mitotic spindle assembly [6]. Analysis of fast-acting dhc-1 temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants has further revealed that dynein is required for chromosome congression to the metaphase plate during mitosis, as well as for mitotic spindle positioning [10].
While many requirements for cytoplasmic dynein are known, our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that target and regulate dynein remains limited. Clearly, the multiple ACs can couple the dynein HC to particular substrates [11], including vesicles, nuclei, viruses, kinetochores, and rhodopsin [see table in 1]. However, reducing the function of only four of the eleven dynein ACs in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> produces lethal phenotypes [12]. Thus, it remains unclear how ACs influence the different essential requirements for dynein. Another potential route for dynein regulation involves the phosphorylation state of the different dynein chains, which in some cases confers distinctive functional properties to the motor. While many examples of dynein phosphorylation exist, and cell cycle dependent changes in phosphorylation have been described [13–15], few if any studies have demonstrated a requirement for such modification during mitosis. Large-scale forward genetic screens have identified genes with requirements similar to those for dynein, but many of these encode core components of the microtubule cytoskeleton and few are known to directly influence dynein itself [12,16]. Genes that do influence dynein function might also have other essential roles, leading to pleiotropic mutant phenotypes that obscure their relationship to dynein [17–19]. Moreover, redundancy within the multigene dynein subunit families, and also perhaps between the different ACs, may complicate the identification of single gene requirements that are important for dynein function. Thus far, reducing the function of individual genes has not provided substantial insight into the mechanisms that regulate and mediate the many different requirements for cytoplasmic dynein during mitosis.
To identify potential regulators of cytoplasmic dynein, we have used a sensitized genetic background to conduct a genome-wide screen for modifiers of dynein function in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>. Other groups have successfully used RNAi modifier screens to identify genes that function in particular pathways [20–23]; we have used RNAi to screen for genes that, when reduced in function, suppress the embryonic lethality associated with a temperature-sensitive (ts) allele of the dhc-1 dynein HC gene. Using the dhc-1ts genetic background, we found 49 genes that, when depleted, suppress the partial loss of HC function. Twenty of these genes suppress conditional dynein HC mutants but not other conditional mutants with unrelated defects. Finally, we show that some of these dynein-specific suppressors encode proteins that may overlap with the dynein HC in subcellular localization.<br><br>Results
To identify dynein suppressors, we used three different conditional and recessive dhc-1 mutants that were identified previously [7]. These ts alleles of dhc-1 (or195, or283, and or352) produce similar defects at the restrictive temperature of 26 °C, including incomplete mitotic spindle assembly in one-cell embryos and embryonic lethality [7]. We sequenced the dhc-1 locus in the three mutants. The independently isolated or195 and or283 alleles each change a conserved serine to leucine at codon 3200, within the coiled-coil region of the microtubule-binding stalk domain (Figure 1A and 1C). The or352 allele replaces a conserved glycine with aspartic acid at codon 2158, in the ATP-binding walker A motif of the second AAA ATPase domain (Figure 1B and 1C). As both missense mutations affect conserved residues, they may prove useful for engineering ts alleles in other organisms. The temperature versus viability curves of the dynein ts mutants feature a steep central transition zone ideal for modifier screening because subtle changes in temperature produce large changes in embryonic viability (Figure 2A).
To identify genes that, when reduced in function, can suppress conditional dhc-1 mutants, we developed a high-throughput RNAi-based screen (Figure 2B). To reduce gene function we used a library of 16,757 bacterial strains that each express a dsRNA corresponding to exon-rich gene sequences [17,19]. We then tested over 99% of the bacterial strains in this library for RNAi-mediated suppression of dhc-1(or195) embryonic lethality at 23 °C, after raising synchronized L1 larvae to adulthood on dsRNA-expressing bacterial lawns in 48-well agar plates. This screening procedure should work to identify nonessential and essential suppressor genes, because RNAi does not always fully reduce gene function [24,25], and even if RNAi does produce lethality, cosuppression could restore viability. Nevertheless, essential genes may be missed due to earlier requirements that produce strong larval arrest, sterile, or embryonic lethal phenotypes.
Using this screening procedure, we identified 49 bacterial clones that consistently increased embryonic viability at the semipermissive temperature. The dsRNA-producing plasmids were then sequenced to verify gene identity. Quantification of embryonic viability using dhc-1(or195) animals showed that the RNAi-mediated depletion of suppressor gene function increased viability to 5%–100%, compared to less than 2% in unsuppressed controls (Figure 3A; Table S1). The proteins encoded by the suppressor genes we identified are summarized in Figure 4.
As a more direct assay for dynein activity in the suppressed dhc-1 embryos, we measured spindle length and cytokinesis success: dhc-1 mutant embryos have severe spindle assembly defects and subsequent cytokinesis failures [6,7,10]. We shifted dhc-1 adult hermaphrodites from 23 °C to the fully restrictive temperature of 26 °C for 3–5 hours and made time-lapse video micrographs using Nomarski optics to monitor the first embryonic cell division. This procedure results in dhc-1(or195) embryos with P0 spindles 30% the length of wild-type spindles (Figure S1). In the suppressed dhc-1(or195) backgrounds, spindle lengths ranged from 30%–83% of wild-type lengths (Figure S1). Similarly, cytokinesis failed in unsuppressed dhc-1(or195) embryos 89% of the time, but most of the suppressors rescued this phenotype (Figure S1). These results indicate that most of the suppressors influence dynein-dependent cellular processes, as expected given their ability to restore viability when reduced in function.
Specificity of Suppression
Because RNAi can reduce the function of unintended targets (so-called “off-target effects” [26,27]), we also used available mutations in some of the suppressor genes we identified to reduce their function. We constructed double mutant strains using dhc-1(or195) and viable deletion alleles for two suppressor genes, dylt-1(ok417) and ufd-2(tm1380), and examined embryonic viability (Figure 3B). The deletion alleles of dylt-1 (encoding a Tctex1-type dynein light chain), and ufd-2 (encoding a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme) both recapitulated the suppression produced by RNAi knockdown (Figure 3B). The dpy-3(e27) and dpy-10(e128) point mutation alleles [28] also suppressed embryonic lethality in double mutants (Figure 3B). Based on this small sampling, and because RNAi in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> appears to be highly gene specific in the absence of close paralogs [12,19], we conclude that many of the suppressors we have identified will prove to be suppressor locus specific. The dsRNA-expressing bacterial clones we used to deplete two of the dynein suppressors (tag-300 and ZK1127.10) probably also knock down expression of one close paralog for each locus [29].
We next asked whether the suppressors are specific for dynein function or if their depletion more generally stabilizes ts proteins. We tested for specificity using two conditional mutants with cell fate patterning defects unrelated to dynein function, lit-1(or131) and spn-4(or191). The lit-1 gene encodes a MAP kinase-related protein [30], while spn-4 encodes a protein with an RNA binding motif [31]. We found that ten of the dhc-1-interacting genes significantly increased embryonic viability in both lit-1 and spn-4 mutants, while 18 others suppressed one or the other of these two conditional mutants when reduced in function using the same RNAi protocol as that used for dhc-1ts mutants (Figure 4, right two columns; Table S1). Therefore, about half of the suppressors appear to act nonspecifically on multiple ts mutants to restore embryonic viability. From here on, we will refer to the suppressors that only acted on dhc-1, and not on lit-1 and spn-4 ts mutants, as dynein-specific suppressors.
Because many ts mutations exert their effect via protein assembly or unfolding mechanisms [32], suppressor genes reduced in function by RNAi might not be expected to exhibit allele specificity with most ts mutations. To determine if the dynein suppressors are either allele or strain specific, we tested the two other conditional dhc-1 strains (containing the or283 and or352 alleles). Although the or283 allele is identical to or195, it provides a useful control for the presence of background mutations because the two strains were isolated independently. In most cases, depletion of the dynein-specific suppressors also restored viability to the other two ts dhc-1 alleles. Y40B1B.5, a putative translation initiation factor, suppressed only one conditional dhc-1 strain, and we consider this as an example of a nonspecific interaction (Figure 4, left three columns; Table S1). Two dsRNAs that do not suppress lit-1 or spn-4 mutants produced suppression in the dhc-1(or195) and dhc-1(or283) strains, but not in the dhc-1(or352) strain, perhaps indicating allele specificity or variability in the RNAi treatments. We conclude that strain background differences are relatively rare, and that the majority of the suppressors are allele-independent. To summarize, we have identified 20 genes that when reduced in function specifically suppress multiple dynein ts strains but not unrelated ts loci.<br><br>Survey of Putative Dynein Accessory Chains
We were surprised to discover that depleting two predicted dynein ACs specifically suppressed the partial loss of HC function, because most dynein accessory subunits are presumed to promote dynein function by aiding dynein complex formation or mediating cargo attachment [3,11,33]. Depletion of either dylt-1 (encoding a Tctex1-type light chain) or dyrb-1 (encoding a roadblock-type light chain) suppressed embryonic lethality in all three ts dynein HC mutant strains (Figure 4). To extend this observation, we surveyed all genes encoding predicted dynein components for suppression of the three ts dhc-1 mutants (Figure 5A; Table S2). We reasoned that some dynein subunit genes could have been missed in the primary screening and several dynein AC genes were not represented in the <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> RNAi library. After using RNAi to reduce their function, we found that one of three Tctex1 homologs (dylt-1), one of four LC8 homologs (dlc-1), one of two light intermediate chains (dli-1), as well as the sole roadblock homolog (dyrb-1) each strongly suppressed the three conditional dynein mutants. Lower-level suppression was also seen for the second light intermediate chain, xbx-1, when its function was reduced. Thus, one gene of each of four subunit classes restores viability to the three dhc-1 mutant strains when depleted by RNAi.
The only subunit class not found to suppress was the intermediate chain, encoded by a single gene in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>, dyci-1. When reduced in function by RNAi, dyci-1 produces a larval arrest phenotype like that observed for dhc-1(RNAi); this phenotype precludes any suppression of the conditional embryonic lethality (shown as “la” in Figure 5A). In contrast, knockdown of either dlc-1 or dli-1 suppresses embryonic lethality in the dhc-1ts mutants, even though reducing their function in otherwise wild-type embryos produces dhc-1-like defects, including embryonic lethality [12,34] (see Figure 5B and Discussion). The suppressing cytoplasmic dynein subunits and DYCI-1 are shown in a putative complex in Figure 5E.
We performed several genetic assays to better understand how the suppressor genes may be operating. First, suppression of dhc-1 lethality by reducing AC function may indicate that our dhc-1 alleles express a neomorphic and toxic DHC-1 protein: if the suppressor dynein AC subunits positively function in dynein processes, depleting them might suppress any neomorphic effects. This explanation is perhaps unlikely, because the dhc-1ts alleles are all recessive, but remained a possibility in dhc-1 homozygotes. We therefore reduced dynein function using RNAi in animals that had passed through the larval arrest points for dhc-1(RNAi) and dyci-1(RNAi). Specifically, we transferred dhc-1(or195) L4 hermaphrodites to plates with bacteria expressing dhc-1 or dyci-1 dsRNA. As control we performed dylt-1(RNAi) using the same procedure. We observed substantial suppression with dylt-1 in this assay, but we saw no suppression with the heavy or intermediate chains (Figure 5C). This suggests that the DHC-1ts protein is not toxic and that dyci-1 acts more like dhc-1 than the other suppressing ACs because it does not suppress the heavy chain mutant.
To further examine the nature of the AC suppression, we asked if depletion of the suppressor chains could bypass the requirement for dhc-1. We transferred wild-type L4 larvae to plates with bacteria expressing dsRNA corresponding to both the suppressor ACs and dhc-1. We did not observe any suppression in these double RNAi assays (Figure 5D), suggesting that dhc-1ts suppression requires the residual activity of the defective DHC-1 protein. We conclude that the dynein AC suppressors inhibit or somehow oppose the function of the DHC-1ts protein, and that the dhc-1(or195ts) mutation does not produce a toxic gene product but simply reduces DHC-1 activity to a low, but non-null, level.<br><br>Localization of the Dynein Suppressor Proteins
To further explore how the suppressor proteins function, we examined the subcellular localization of nine of them as stably expressed N-terminal GFP::S fusions. We chose to first focus on the suppressor genes that were conserved but poorly characterized in any system, or were conserved but uncharacterized during early <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> embryogenesis. Prior dynein immunocytochemistry-based localization studies serve as a comparison [6,10,35]. As in other species, <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> DHC-1 is associated with mitotic spindles, centrosomes, the nuclear envelope, the cell cortex, the midbody, and throughout the cytoplasm. Most of the suppressor proteins we examined localized to sites where DHC-1 is known to act or localize (Figure 6). However, the nearly ubiquitous distribution of DHC-1 in early embryonic cells makes colocalization likely but not necessarily meaningful, and biochemical studies are needed to conclusively address any direct or indirect physical associations.
Four suppressor GFP fusion proteins localized to nuclear membranes and to spindle poles or pericentrosomal regions. The DYLT-1 and DYRB-1 dynein light chains were associated with nuclear envelopes and centrosomes, as well as meiotic and mitotic spindle poles (Figure 6A–6H; Videos S1 and S2). The potential coiled-coil protein K04F10.3 was present on the nuclear envelope and in a pericentrosomal position during mitosis, similar to endoplasmic reticulum proteins [36] (Figure 6I–6L; Video S3). K04F10.3 was also highly enriched at meiotic spindle poles (Figure 6I), which has been observed for other endoplasmic reticulum proteins [36]. The NPP-22 transmembrane nucleoporin was found at nuclear envelopes (Figure 6M–6P; Video S4), as previously reported for later stage embryos [37], and it also surrounded centrosomes during mitosis. Two splice isoforms of the pleckstrin homology domain–containing EFA-6/Y55D9A.1, an ARF guanine nucleotide exchange factor, were enriched cortically both in the anterior portion of the one-cell zygote and at the blastomere boundary in two-cell embryos (Figure 6Q–6T; Videos S5 and S6). The conserved Mo25 homolog MOP-25.2/Y53C12A.4 was found enriched in a single spot after cytokinesis that appears to correspond to the midbody (Figure 6U–6X; Video S7). F10E7.8, a highly conserved ortholog of <span class="yellow">S. cerevisiae</span> Far11, appears nuclear (Figure 6Y–6B′ and Video S8). Finally, the nonspecific suppressor protein STAR-2, a predicted RNA binding protein, appears to be associated with P-granules (like its homolog GLD-1), where dynein is neither localized nor known to function (Figure 6C′–6F′).<br><br>DLYT-1 and DYRB-1: Dynein Light Chain Localization
The <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> dynein HC protein weakly localizes to spindle poles during early embryonic cell cycles [6,10], and so did DYRB-1 and DYLT-1 (Videos S9 and S10). However, ts mutant forms of the DHC-1 protein (including DHC-1 encoded by the or195 allele) strongly localize to centrosomes when shifted to the non-permissive temperature [10]. The mechanism underlying this enhanced localization is not known, but it may represent trapping of the defective protein at a normally transient location. We exploited this behavior of the mutant DHC-1 protein to determine whether redistribution of the putative DYRB-1 and DYLT-1 dynein light chains also occurred in the dhc-1(or195) background.
We found that the cellular distributions of DYRB-1 and DYLT-1 were dramatically altered in dhc-1(or195) mutant embryos. After shifting the parental <span class="yellow">worms</span> to the restrictive temperature for 3–5 h prior to collecting embryos, these two proteins were prominently localized to centrosomes and to spindle poles that did not separate in one-cell stage embryos (Figure 7; Videos S11 and S12). The spindle pole to cytoplasmic fluorescence ratio during late anaphase was 5-fold higher in both of the dhc-1 homozygous mutant strains when compared to wild-type embryos expressing the GFP fusions. We also assayed localization of the two putative dynein light chains after short temperature shifts to the nonpermissive temperature in the dhc-1(or195) mutant background, which yields mitotic spindles with an overall wild-type appearance and function. These short temperature shifts also resulted in robust localization of these two dynein light chains to centrosomes (unpublished data). Finally, we examined the localization of GFP::DYRB-1 and GFP::DYLT-1 in embryos from dhc-1(or195) −/+ <span class="yellow">worms</span> grown at the dhc-1(or195) permissive temperature of 15 °C. Even though embryos from mothers heterozygous for this recessive mutation are viable and develop normally, even at 26 °C [7], we observed a substantial increase in both GFP fusion proteins at the mitotic spindle poles in early embryos (Figure 7; Videos S13 and S14). Importantly, localization of DYLT-1 and DYRB-1 to centrosomes does not occur in embryos depleted for DHC-1 with RNAi (our unpublished results), indicating that these proteins require the mutant DHC-1 polypeptide for centrosomal targeting in the dhc-1(or195) embryos. In summary, the DYRB-1 and DYLT-1 proteins localize to sites where the DHC-1 HC is also found in wild-type embryos, and all three proteins respond similarly to mutational alterations in DHC-1.<br><br>Genetic Characterization of the DYLT-1 and DYRB-1 Dynein Light Chains
We obtained putative null alleles to determine if dylt-1 and dyrb-1 function in dynein-dependent processes. DYLT-1 is 40% identical to <span class="yellow">human</span> DYNLT3 and 38% identical to <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> Dlc90F (see alignment in Figure 8A). Two other <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> genes, dylt-2 and dylt-3, encode more divergent members of this protein family. DYRB-1 is 49% identical to both <span class="yellow">human</span> DYNLRB1 and <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> Robl (see alignment in Figure 8A). There do not appear to be other Roadblock genes in the <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> genome [3]. Deletion alleles for both dylt-1 and dyrb-1 have been isolated (Figure 8B). The dylt-1(ok417) deletion removes the entire DYLT-1 open reading frame and does not affect adjacent coding regions. The dyrb-1(tm2645) deletion removes 69% of the dyrb-1 coding region, leaving 29 predicted N-terminal amino acids, and does not affect adjacent coding regions.
Both deletions are currently annotated as homozygous viable [29]. However, we found that the dyrb-1(tm2645) strain was in fact heterozygous for the deletion and that most embryos produced by dyrb-1(tm2645) homozygous animals failed to hatch (Figure 8C). Homozygous dyrb-1(tm2645) <span class="yellow">worms</span> also showed an egg-laying defect and produced small broods (unpublished data). To determine if the dyrb-1 deletion was responsible for the embryonic lethality, we crossed the GFP::dyrb-1 transgene into the deletion background. The presence of the transgene fully rescued the embryonic lethality (Figure 8C), but not the egg-laying defect: the transgene is driven from a germline-specific promoter and so would not be expected to rescue zygotic phenotypes. The embryonic lethality exhibited by dyrb-1(tm2645) mutants is consistent with RNAi studies performed by injection or soaking [12,38]. In contrast, homozygous dylt-1 deletion mutants did not exhibit any larval or embryonic lethality (Figure 8C).
To determine if these dynein light chain mutants exhibit dynein HC-like phenotypes, we observed the completion of meiotic polar body extrusion and the first two mitotic cell divisions in mutant embryos (Figure 8D). The dylt-1 embryos appeared wild type for completion of meiosis, pronuclear migration, and spindle assembly and function. However, the dyrb-1 embryos occasionally contained extra female pronuclei (observed in four of 12 recordings, Figure 8D), suggesting that polar body extrusion was defective, and pronuclear migration was often slow compared to wild-type embryos. Once formed, spindles appeared functional using Nomarski optics, although they were frequently positioned improperly and had large spindle poles, as has also been observed after RNAi knockdown [12]. Thus, these two genes are not strictly essential, but the DYRB-1 protein clearly is required for dynein-dependent processes.<br><br>
Discussion
By using the suppressor screening method outlined in Figure 2B, we have isolated and characterized 49 genes that when reduced in function can suppress a partial loss of dynein HC function. This screening procedure takes advantage of sensitized genetic backgrounds using conditional mutants, can be completed for one mutant in less than 5 wk, and is scalable so that many mutants can be screened in parallel. In fact, we have performed 15 such screens in different sensitized backgrounds (unpublished data). By using three dhc-1ts mutant strains, we found that strain background differences and allele specificity are minimal because most of these genes suppress all three dynein mutants when reduced in function using RNAi. Furthermore, by using two unrelated ts mutants to assay for specificity, we found that 57% of the suppressor genes suppress multiple unrelated mutant loci. Thus, it is clear that assaying the specificity of suppression is critical for evaluating the functional significance of these RNAi interactions. Eliminating the analysis of these nonspecific genes in future screens will save time and resources. Most of the specific suppressor proteins we examined appear to overlap in subcellular localization with the dynein HC, based on previous studies of DHC-1, while one nonspecific suppressor protein, STAR-2, localized to germline P-granules, where dynein is not known to function.
Many of the 20 genes that specifically suppress multiple dhc-1ts alleles are nonessential in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> but well conserved nonetheless. Six of eight deletion alleles available for the 20 specific suppressor genes are homozygous viable, and six additional specific genes do not display lethal phenotypes when reduced in function by RNAi in wild-type <span class="yellow">worms</span> [29]. Thus, our genetic screening has identified roles in an essential process for at least 12 apparently nonessential genes. Fourteen of the specific dynein suppressor genes have <span class="yellow">human</span> orthologs as determined by best reciprocal BLAST hits (Table 1), while mop-25.2 has a conserved <span class="yellow">human</span> homolog but also a paralog in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>. Eleven of these conserved genes are nonessential in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>. Interestingly, eight of the conserved genes in Table 1 have been implicated in <span class="yellow">human</span> disease etiology, with three of them identified as the causative gene [39–41]. Thus, using sensitized genetic backgrounds for genome-wide modifier screens can identify roles for nonessential but conserved genes and thereby provide insights into <span class="yellow">human</span> disease.
Nonspecific Suppression of Conditional Mutants
We examined the predicted molecular functions of the suppressor proteins to better understand the basis for the nonspecific suppression phenomenon. Strikingly, many of the nonspecific suppressor genes encode proteins with predicted roles in mitochondrial, ribosomal, and collagen function (18 of 29 genes, or 62%), while only two such genes appeared to specifically suppress dhc-1 (2 of 20 genes or 10%). It is possible that stress produced by RNAi knockdown of these suppressor genes triggers the activity of molecular chaperones that can generally restore function to ts proteins. Indeed, mutation of dpy-10 is known to suppress three other ts mutants: glp-1, emb-5, and mup-1 [42–44]. Furthermore, RNAi reduction of dpy-10, star-2, osr-1, or C50D2.1 (all suppressors of dhc-1, lit-1, and spn-4 ts alleles) induces the glycerol biosynthetic gene gpdh-2, while dpy-10 and osr-1 mutants exhibit increased glycerol levels, a condition that promotes protein stability [45]. We suggest that partial loss of central metabolic processes can invoke stress responses that nonspecifically alleviate protein-folding problems in ts proteins. Filtering out these nonspecific interactions by testing unrelated conditional mutants increases the likelihood that the remaining suppressor genes are more directly involved with dynein function. However, ts mutants likely differ in their susceptibility to nonspecific suppression mechanisms, and some apparently unrelated ts mutants might share common cofactors such that both mutants are suppressed by depletion of the same cofactor. Nevertheless, we expect that more extensive testing for specificity will prove very useful for judging the significance of modifier interactions.<br><br>Possible Relevance of Suppressor Proteins to Dynein Function
We examined the localization of a number of GFP fusions to suppressor proteins to gain insight into their functional relationship to dynein. In several cases, the subcellular distribution of the suppressor proteins overlapped in different ways with the known and nearly ubiquitous distribution of cytoplasmic dynein in the early <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> embryo. In fact, the only specific suppressor that did not display dynein-like localization was F10E7.8, a homolog of <span class="yellow">yeast</span> Far11 of unknown function [46], which was nuclear. The one nonspecific suppressor protein we examined did not show any dynein-like localization patterns. The subcellular localizations of the GFP::suppressor protein fusions are intriguing. However, given the nearly ubiquitous distribution of dynein in early embryonic cells, biochemical tests for direct association are needed to address the significance of any colocalization detected using light microscopy.
We are particularly interested in suppressor proteins that localize to mitotic spindle poles: the association of the DYLT-1 and DYRB-1 predicted dynein light chains with centrosomes and spindle poles suggests that they may be components of cytoplasmic dynein in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>. Localization of cytoplasmic dynein to centrosomes and spindle poles is well established [47,48], and the inhibition of dynein function prevents centrosome separation, centrosome attachment to nuclei, and the formation of bipolar spindles [6,10,49,50]. Moreover, the centrosomal localization of DHC-1, DYLT-1, and DYRB-1 are all greatly enhanced in dhc-1ts mutant embryos: this dependence of the light chain distribution on the HC further suggests they reside in the same motor complex (Figure 7 and [10]). Furthermore, roadblock light chains are well-established components of dynein, and all of the roadblock protein in mammalian liver extracts is dynein associated [51,52]. Finally, a DYLT-1 homolog in vertebrates is a stoichiometric subunit of cytoplasmic dynein [53]. The presence of these two light chains in a dynein complex is consistent with them having either positive or negative roles in the regulation of HC function (see below).
Cytoplasmic dynein is found on the nuclear envelope where it is thought to regulate nuclear membrane breakdown during mitosis [54], and dynein plays roles during the trafficking of endoplasmic reticulum components [55,56]. Therefore, the nuclear envelope/endoplasmic reticulum proteins NPP-22 and K04F10.3 could couple dynein activity to either of these structures. The anc-1 gene was also isolated in our screening and ANC-1 is localized to the nuclear envelope where it maintains nuclear positioning in postembryonic cells [57]. Reducing the function of these three genes may suppress partial loss of dynein HC mutants by reducing the need for dynein during nuclear envelope breakdown, through constitutive partial destabilization of the nuclear envelope.
The distribution of the cytoplasmic dynein HC includes sites other than spindle poles and nuclear envelopes in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>, for example, at the cell cortex and at the cell division remnant called the midbody [6,10]. The MOP-25.2 protein was found at the midbody and faintly at spindle poles. The MOP-25.2 ortholog in <span class="yellow">S. pombe</span>, Pmo25, is also present at the cell division site and on spindle poles [58]. Mammalian MOP-25.2 homologs stimulate the kinase activity of the LKB1 tumor suppressor (the <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> ortholog is PAR-4), which in turn activates MARK microtubule-destabilizing kinases [59,60]. The <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> MARK ortholog, PAR-1, controls cell polarity during embryogenesis, and orthologs have been implicated in regulation of microtubule dynamics from <span class="yellow">yeast</span> to <span class="yellow">humans</span> [61–64].
Lastly, the two splice isoforms of EFA-6 were associated with the anterior cell cortex in late one-cell embryos. Cortically localized dynein may have important roles in applying forces to astral microtubules that influence mitotic spindle positioning and chromosome separation during anaphase [10,65,66]. EFA6 ARF guanine nucleotide exchange factors require their pleckstrin homology domain for cortical targeting, and are known to regulate cortical actin dynamics in vertebrate cells by promoting guanine nucleotide exchange on ARF6 [67,68]. Our results identifying efa-6 as a dynein HC suppressor suggest a functional linkage of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons at the cell cortex. Interestingly, two <span class="yellow">yeast</span> pleckstrin homology domain proteins, Num1 and mcp5+, localize to the cell cortex and direct astral microtubule and dynein function, although they do not contain a Sec7 domain like EFA-6 does [69–71].<br><br>Function of Dynein Intermediate, Light Intermediate, and Light Chains
The dynein chains in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> exhibit strikingly different functional requirements. The DYRB-1 roadblock light chain is required for completion of meiosis and pronuclear migration, but an at least partially functional mitotic spindle forms in the absence of DYRB-1 (Figure 8). The DLI-1 light intermediate chain is required for multiple dynein-dependent functions: pronuclear migration, centrosome separation, and meiotic and mitotic spindle function [12,34]. DLI-1 may promote nuclear envelope targeting of both centrosomes and DHC-1 by interacting with the nuclear envelope protein ZYG-12 [35]. The second worm light intermediate chain gene, xbx-1, is required for cilia function but not early embryonic development [12,72]. RNAi knockdown of DLC-1, one of three LC8 proteins in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>, produces defects similar to dli-1 but knockdown of the other two LC8-related genes does not result in any phenotypes [12]. RNAi depletion of dyci-1 results in severe meiotic, pronuclear migration, and mitotic spindle assembly defects [12] and in our feeding RNAi regimen dyci-1(RNAi) produces a larval arrest phenotype similar to that observed for dhc-1. Finally, the three Tctex1 proteins in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>, DYLT-1, 2, and 3, are not essential for dynein-related functions [12]. As the dyrb-1, dlc-1, and dli-1 dynein AC genes display some dhc-1-like requirements, they positively influence dynein function. However, because reducing their function suppresses dhc-1ts mutants, they may also exert negative regulation (along with dylt-1) on the heavy chain.<br><br>Negative Regulation of Dynein HC by Light Chain Subunits
Finding that reducing the function of light and light intermediate dynein chains suppressed the partial loss of HC function was a striking result. One member of each of four subunit classes can suppress the embryonic lethality associated with three dhc-1 ts mutants (Figure 5). We have considered two different models to explain how RNAi-mediated depletion of these dynein ACs can suppress reduced HC function. First, these dynein subunits could be in functional complexes with, and exert negative regulation on, the DHC-1 HC (Figure 5B). The suppression mechanism in this case proposes that removal of the suppressing ACs increases residual mutant DHC-1 activity. The other, nonsuppressing, accessory subunits might then function in nonmitotic cellular processes such as neuronal transport or organelle positioning. In support of this view, physical removal of the intermediate chains of <span class="yellow">rat</span> cytoplasmic dynein increased HC ATPase activity by about 4-fold (light chains were not monitored in this study but were likely removed as well) [73]. Thus, at least with respect to ATPase activity, some dynein ACs do act as biochemical negative regulators of HC function.<br><br>An Assortment of Essential and Nonessential Dynein Complexes
Alternatively, an assortment of dynein complexes (with different ACs) could coexist within early embryonic cells, with only a subset required for the essential mitotic functions that require DHC-1. In this case, suppression might result from the release of DHC-1 HCs from less essential motor complexes, allowing more of the functionally compromised HCs to participate in the essential process of mitosis. We currently disfavor this hypothesis because two of the suppressing light chains (DYLT-1 and DYRB-1) can indeed localize to meiotic and mitotic spindles (Figures 6 and 7), sites where DHC-1 has been shown by others to localize and function. Furthermore, the distribution of DYRB-1 and DYLT-1 closely resembles the distribution of the HC in dhc-1(or195) embryos, suggesting that these two light chains associate with the HC during mitosis (Figure 7 and [10]). Finally, dhc-1-like phenotypes result from mutation or RNAi knockdown of three suppressing ACs in otherwise wild-type <span class="yellow">worms</span>, indicating that they share at least some common and essential requirements. Regardless of the suppression mechanism, our identification of ACs that genetically interact with the DHC-1 HC provides a basis for functionally classifying the paralogs of these dynein subunit gene families, and for further investigation of dynein composition and function.<br><br>Nonessential Dynein Subunits and Negative Regulation of the HC
Some ACs are nonessential, supporting the view that some cytoplasmic dynein subunits could function by exerting negative regulation on the HC, rather than positively influencing essential HC function. For example, DYRB-1 is not absolutely required for viability because <span class="yellow">worms</span> lacking this protein can be propagated, although they are extremely sick and do exhibit two dhc-1-like phenotypes (Figure 8). Also, homozygous dylt-1 deletion mutants appear fully viable (Figure 8). The two additional Tctex1 <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> genes could be functionally redundant with DYLT-1, but simultaneously reducing the function of DYLT-2 and DYLT-3 by RNAi in the dylt-1 deletion strain did not cause lethality (unpublished data). Because RNAi does not always completely reduce function, the question of redundancy in the Tctex1 <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> gene family remains unresolved. However, <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> contains only a single Tctex1 gene, Dlc90F [74,75]. A Dlc90F null allele that deletes 80% of the open reading frame is essential only for sperm production but not for viability of male or female <span class="yellow">flies</span>, despite the wild-type protein being incorporated into dynein motors and expressed in various <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> tissues [74]. Thus, at least in <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span>, the Tctex1 dynein light chain family is not required for cell division processes like the HC is. Interestingly, budding <span class="yellow">yeast</span> does not possess genes for the Tctex1 or roadblock ACs, indicating that functional cytoplasmic dynein does not require these subunits that are conserved in many other organisms. The AC genes that <span class="yellow">yeast</span> does posses are not required for HC motility in vitro because dynein purified from <span class="yellow">yeast</span> with mutations in these genes remains fully active [2]. Thus, dynein function in several contexts does not require AC subunits, and we suggest that in some cases they may have negative regulatory roles. Negative regulation of cytoplasmic dynein may be redundant with other modes of HC regulation or only required during special circumstances. Further studies of subunit localization, and in vitro studies of <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> dynein motility, may provide further insight into the modes of AC regulation and function.<br><br>
Materials and Methods
<span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> strains and culture.
Strains were cultured according to standard procedures [28]. ts mutants were maintained at 15 °C and GFP-expressing strains in a wild-type background were maintained in a 23 °C incubator. dhc-1(or195) was outcrossed six times to the N2 Bristol wild-type strain and the or283 and or352 dhc-1 mutants were each outcrossed four times with N2. For sequencing mutant dhc-1 loci, genomic DNA was amplified as overlapping ∼1-kb fragments from the start codon to the stop codon and sequenced at the University of Oregon DNA sequencing laboratory. For double mutant constructions, the dhc-1(or195) mutation was monitored by sequencing or by assaying a restriction fragment length polymorphism caused by the mutation with Hpy188I (New England Biolabs, http://www.neb.com), following PCR amplification of the mutated region. The dylt-1(ok417) and ufd-2(tm1380) alleles were monitored by PCR amplification of genomic sequence encompassing the deletions and assaying product size by agarose gel electrophoresis.<br><br>GFP imaging.
Visualization of GFP fusion protein localization was accomplished by mounting embryos on M9 + 3% agarose pads on microscope slides covered with a coverslip. Time-lapse videos were obtained on a spinning disk Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope (Nikon Instruments, http://www.nikon.com) fitted with an ORCA-ER digital camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, http://www.hamamatsu.com) using a Nikon 60×, 1.4 NA Plan Apo oil objective lens. Videos were adjusted for contrast in ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) [76], images were adjusted for levels in Adobe Photoshop (http://www.adobe.com/).<br><br>RNAi screening.
After obtaining the <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> RNAi library from the MRC Geneservice (Cambridge, UK) [17,19], we rearrayed it into a 48-well microplate format using a liquid-handling Qiagen BioRobot 8000 (http://www.qiagen.com). <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> strains were thawed from −80 °C storage and inoculated into 1 ml of LB + 100 mg/ml ampicillin-containing 96-well growth plates (Whatman, http://www.whatman.com) and covered with microporous sealing film (USA Scientific, http://www.usascientific.com). Only 48 wells of the 96-well growth plates were filled with media, corresponding to the rearrayed <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> library. After overnight shaking incubation at 37 °C, 20 μl of the cultures were dispensed with a 24-channel electronic repeating pipette (Rainin, http://www.rainin.com) onto 48-well plates (Nunc, http://www.nuncbrand.com/) containing NGM agar, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 1 mM IPTG and allowed to dry and induce dsRNA at 37 °C overnight. The 48-well agar plates were filled with a Wheaton Unispense peristaltic pump (http://www.wheaton.com) equipped with a custom-made adaptor (University of Oregon Technical Science Administration) that allowed simultaneous filling of eight wells with the agar solution. Approximately 15 hypochlorite-synchronized L1 mutant larvae were pipetted into each well of the 48-well plates with a multichannel pipette and allowed to produce broods. Screening for F1 viability was performed by visual examination with a dissecting microscope. Phenotypes were recorded on an Excel spreadsheet (http://www.microsoft.com) and organized in a FileMaker Pro (http://www.filemaker.com) database. We qualitatively identified 295 initial positive suppressing <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> strains, for which we repeated the assay on 60-mm plates with <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> again thawed from the library (not streak purified). If the observed phenotypes reproduced, the assay was performed with three streak-purified <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> colonies, and a single isolate that again displayed the interaction was kept for further analysis.<br><br>Embryonic viability quantitation methods.
To quantitate embryonic viability we used the following procedure. Cultures of dsRNA-producing bacteria were grown overnight in LB + 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cultures (0.2 ml) were seeded onto 60-mm NGM agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 1 mM IPTG and allowed to induce dsRNAs overnight at room temperature. The L4440 control vector-containing strain was used as the bacterial lawn for the experiments shown in Figures 2A and 3B. Approximately 80 synchronized L1 larvae (obtained from hypochlorite-treated <span class="yellow">worms</span>) were pipetted onto the plates and allowed to grow to young adulthood. Five gravid <span class="yellow">worms</span> were transferred to prepared NGM agar plates supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 1 mM IPTG containing a small RNAi bacterial lawn produced from ∼5 μl of overnight <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> culture. After producing broods, the adult <span class="yellow">worms</span> were removed and the embryos were allowed to develop for at least 24 h. Embryos and larvae were then counted immediately or after storage at 4 °C. We considered only suppressor dsRNAs that increased embryonic viability greater than 3-fold above the background viability observed with the L4440 control vector (in the dhc-1(or195)) screen to be significant enough for continued study.<br><br>Molecular biology.
We introduced a polylinker site containing six unique restriction enzyme recognition sites into the pIC26 GFP-S protein plasmid by using phosphorylated and PAGE-purified synthetic oligonucleotides [77]. Following ligation, the new plasmid was sequence verified. The modified vector, pSO26, allows the use of additional restriction enzymes and directional cloning for inserting genes of interest (Figure S2). The SpeI site was recreated at the 5′ end of the polylinker but not at the 3′ end. We amplified N2 genomic DNA or cDNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) with Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene, http://www.stratagene.com), and cloned A-tailed PCR products into either pGEM-T or pGEM-T-easy shuttle vectors (Promega, http://www.promega.com). Inserted genes were sequence verified at the University of Oregon DNA sequencing laboratory prior to cleavage and ligation to pSO26 (see Table S3 for restriction sites and primer sequences used). All of the constructs used in this study were cloned as SpeI-AsiSI or AscI-AsiSI fragments, except for the STAR-2 gene, which was amplified as a SpeI fragment and cloned into pIC26.
To construct dynein subunit dsRNA-expressing plasmids not available in the RNAi library, gene fragments were amplified from N2 genomic DNA with the following primers: F41G4.1: 5′-AAGATATCACCCAAAATGGTCCAAAACAAAG-3′ and 5′-CGGATATCTCGACTGAAGCTGGTTCTGA-3′, xbx-1: 5′-AAGATATCTACGACGATGGAAGTTTGAAG-3′ and 5′-CGGATATCCGTGCCTCTGCAGC-3′, dlc-3: 5′-AAGATATCAATTTCAGGTGGACACTGGC-3′ and 5′-CGGATATCAGCACACTTGCATCATCTGAA-3′. The PCR products were cut with EcoRV, ligated to EcoRV-digested L4440, and sequence verified.<br><br>Isolation of transgenic <span class="yellow">worms</span>.
GFP fusion plasmids were bombarded into unc-119(ed3) <span class="yellow">worms</span> as previously described except with the following two changes [78]. Three milligrams of gold particles were used per hepta adaptor bombardment. Also, we briefly sonicated the gold particles (prior to DNA coating and while suspended in 50% glycerol) with a Branson sonifier 450 (http://www.sonifier.com/) fitted with a small tip set to power level 1, to disrupt gold aggregates. Non-Unc <span class="yellow">worms</span> were picked to new plates and allowed to produce broods, which were assayed for GFP fluorescence with a Zeiss axioskop microscope (http://www.zeiss.com/) fitted with an X-Cite 120 illumination system (EXFO life sciences, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). For each fluorescent line, 12 GFP-positive <span class="yellow">worms</span> were singled to new plates to determine if the constructs were integrated or were carried as extrachromosomal arrays.<br><br>

Abstract
An intronic hexanucleotide UGCAUG has been shown to play a critical role in the regulation of tissue-specific alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs in a wide range of tissues. Vertebrate Fox-1 has been shown to bind to this element, in a highly sequence-specific manner, through its RNA recognition motif (RRM). In mammals, there are at least two Fox-1-related genes, ataxin-2 binding protein 1 (A2BP1)/Fox-1 and Fxh/Rbm9, which encode an identical RRM. Here, we demonstrate that both <span class="yellow">mouse</span> Fxh and A2BP1 transcripts undergo tissue-specific alternative splicing, generating protein isoforms specific to brain and muscle. These tissue-specific isoforms are characterized for their abilities to regulate neural cell-specific alternative splicing of a cassette exon, N30, in the non-muscle myosin heavy chain II-B pre-mRNA, previously shown to be regulated through an intronic distal downstream enhancer (IDDE). All Fxh and A2BP1 isoforms with the RRM are capable of binding to the IDDE in vitro through the UGCAUG elements. Each isoform, however, shows quantitative differences in splicing activity and nuclear distribution in transfected cells. All Fxh isoforms and a brain isoform of A2BP1 show a predominant nuclear localization. Brain isoforms of both Fxh and A2BP1 promote N30 splicing much more efficiently than do the muscle-specific isoforms. Skeletal muscles express additional isoforms that lack a part of the RRM. These isoforms are incapable of activating neural cell-specific splicing and, moreover, can inhibit UGCAUG-dependent N30 splicing. These findings suggest that tissue-specific isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 play an important role in determining tissue specificity of UGCAUG-mediated alternative splicing.<br><br>INTRODUCTION
Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA is one of the fundamental mechanisms for the regulation of gene expression in higher eukaryotes (1,2). Developmentally regulated, cell type- or tissue-specific, and signal-induced alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs takes place in multicellular organisms throughout their lifetimes. Misregulation or abnormalities in pre-mRNA splicing, in some instances, leads to cellular dysfunctions found in <span class="yellow">human</span> and animal diseases (3–5). Using various model systems of regulated alternative splicing, a number of pre-mRNA features that influence alternative splice site selection have been defined (1,2). These include enhancer and repressor RNA sequences located in exons and introns. Identification of RNA-binding proteins targeting these cis-regulatory elements is currently in progress. In vertebrates, participation of the SR family proteins and hnRNP proteins, such as PTB and hnRNPA1, in alternative splicing regulation via binding to the cis-regulatory elements have been shown in many tissue-specific splicing models (6,7). Although these RNA-binding proteins are ubiquitously expressed, their different abundance in different cells, differences in their post-translational modifications in different cellular contexts and their different abilities to assemble multiprotein complexes in different pre-mRNA contexts are thought to contribute to the determination of cell type-specific patterns of alternative splicing. For the last few years, tissue-specific and tissue-enriched RNA-binding proteins have begun to be identified as splicing regulators. These include brain-specific (or enriched) Nova-1, nPTB (brPTB) and some of the CELF family proteins (8–12). Discovery of these proteins has had a great impact on studies aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms of alternative splicing regulation.
One of the intronic cis-elements, which are involved in tissue-specific or differentiation stage-dependent regulation of alternative splicing, is the hexanucleotide UGCAUG. The importance of this element was originally recognized in fibronectin pre-mRNA by Huh and Hynes (13). Since then, alternative splicing specific to a variety of tissues or cell types, including neural cells, muscles, epithelial cells and erythrocytes, has been shown to be modulated via this element (14–21). Recently, Jin et al. (21) discovered that a <span class="yellow">zebrafish</span> homolog of <span class="blue">Caenorhabditis elegans</span> Fox-1 (22) could bind specifically to the pentanucleotide GCAUG by in vitro selection from randomized RNA sequences. This pentanucleotide is almost identical to the hexanucleotide UGCAUG except for the first U. Moreover, the <span class="yellow">zebrafish</span> Fox-1 homolog, as well as the <span class="yellow">mouse</span> Fox-1 homolog, are capable of repressing the inclusion of an alternative cassette exon of the ATP synthase F1γ pre-mRNA via binding to GCAUG, which mimics muscle-specific exclusion of this exon. This <span class="yellow">mouse</span> homolog is identical to the ataxin-2 binding protein 1 (A2BP1), which has been previously cloned in <span class="yellow">humans</span> and <span class="yellow">mice</span> as the cDNA encoding a protein, which interacts with ataxin-2, the product of the causative gene for spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (23,24). In addition to A2BP1/Fox-1, another <span class="yellow">mouse</span> homolog of <span class="yellow">C.elegans</span> Fox-1, Fxh, has been independently cloned as a cDNA, which is induced by androgen in motor neurons (25). Of note is that A2BP1/Fox-1 and Fxh share an identical RNA recognition motif (RRM) at the amino acid level. Therefore, two genes in the <span class="yellow">mouse</span> genome encode homologs of nematode Fox-1. According to the names given by the first cDNA cloning, we used the nomenclature of A2BP1 and Fxh in this report. A2BP1 and Fxh have been named A2BP1 and Rbm9, respectively, in the <span class="yellow">human</span> and <span class="yellow">mouse</span> genomes.
We have been studying regulatory mechanisms of neural cell-specific alternative splicing using the non-muscle myosin heavy chain II-B (NMHC-B) gene as a model system (14,26). NMHC-B mRNA is expressed ubiquitously. However, an alternative exon, N30, which encodes a 30 nt coding sequence, is included in the mRNAs from some neural cells, but is skipped in those from all other cells in mammals and birds (27,28). In cultured cells, a switch in N30 splicing from exclusion to inclusion can be seen in neural retinoblastoma Y79 cells during the post-mitotic and differentiated stages triggered by butyrate treatment. We have previously defined an intronic distal downstream enhancer (IDDE), which confers neural cell specificity on N30 inclusion, using this cell line (14). The IDDE includes two copies of UGCAUG. Mutation of these hexanucleotides results in N30 skipping in post-mitotic differentiated Y79 cells.
In this study, we investigated the possible involvement of A2BP1 and Fxh in the regulation of N30 splicing. To this end, we have isolated cDNA clones for A2BP1 and Fxh from brain and muscles. cDNA cloning revealed the existence of tissue-specific (enriched) isoforms of both A2BP1 and Fxh. Of importance, different isoforms of A2BP1 and Fxh show different activities with respect to N30 splicing as well as different subcellular localizations.<br><br>MATERIALS AND METHODS

The sequences reported in this paper have been deposited in the GenBank database with accession numbers AY659951 (F011), AY659952 (F411), AY659953 (F402), AY659954 (A016), AY659955 (A030), AY659956 (A713), AY659957 (A715) and AY659958 (A704).<br><br>RNA preparation and RT–PCR
Total RNAs were isolated from <span class="yellow">mouse</span> tissues and cultured cells using an RNA isolation kit (Stratagene) or an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). To obtain the full-length coding regions of cDNAs for Fxh and A2BP1, RT–PCRs were performed using Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The PCR primers used to obtain all Fxh cDNAs were 5′-ctcaggcctccactagttATGGAGAAAAAGAAAATGGTAACTC-3′ and 5′-ctcaggcctcctctagaaGTAGGGGGCAAATCGGCTGTA-3′. The upstream primers for the brain (A016 and A030) and muscle (A713, A715 and A704) A2BP1 cDNAs were 5′-ctcaggcctccactagtgATGAATTGTGAAAGAGAGCAGCT-3′ and 5′-ctcaggcctccactagtcATGTTGGCGTCGCAAGGAGTCC-3′, respectively, and the downstream primer for all A2BP1 cDNAs was 5′-ctcaggcctcctctagagATATGGAGCAAAACGGTTGTATCC-3′. Lower case letters represent adapter sequences including restriction enzyme sites. 5′ Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed using Marathon-Ready cDNA (BD Biosciences Clontech). For the analysis of minigene and NMHC-B mRNAs, RT–PCRs were performed as described previously (14,26). Sequences of primers P1–P9 shown in Figures 1, 4 and 6 are as follows: P1, 5′-AATTCACCCAGCAACCAGAAT-3′; P2, 5′-TAGAGGGATGTAAGTGTTGATGCC-3′; P3, 5′-CAGAGGGCGGACAGTGTATGGT-3′; P4, 5′-GGCGGCAGGGGCGAGGGCAT-3′; P5, 5′-CCGTGGTCGCACCGTGTACAAC-3′; P6, 5′-CAGCGGCAGTGGCAGGGGTG-3′; P7, 5′-AGGAAGAAAGGACCATAATATTCC-3′; P8, 5′-CCTCCACCCAGCTCCAGTTGT-3′; and P9, 5′-CCTGTAGTTATTAAATCCTTCAAG-3′.<br><br>Preparation of expression constructs and minigenes
The cDNAs of Fxh and A2BP1 were introduced into a plasmid pCS3 + MT, which contains a myc-epitope, and its modified version pCS3 + MT + NLS, which in addition contains the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of the <span class="yellow">SV40</span> large T antigen (26). Minigenes G, J without the IDDE, and H with the wild-type IDDE are the same as minigenes W, D4 and Cm0, respectively in ref. (14). The 201 nt IDDEs with mutations were generated by recombinant PCR using the appropriate primers, which included mutated sequences. The hexanucleotide TGCATG sequences at the 5′ and 3′ sides were changed to GTTACT and ACCTAC, respectively.<br><br>Electrophoresis mobility shift assay
Template DNAs for in vitro RNA transcription were prepared by PCR using the wild-type and mutant IDDEs in the minigenes as templates and an upstream primer that included the T7 promoter sequence at the 5′ end. The probe and competitor RNAs were transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP and a trace amount of [35S]UTPαS, respectively, using a MAXIscript kit (Ambion). Mole concentrations of synthesized RNAs were estimated by radioactivities. Fxh and A2BP1 proteins with a myc tag were synthesized in vitro by using a TNT quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) from pCS3 + MT constructs, which include the SP6 promoter. Binding reactions were carried out in a 10 μl mixture that contains 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 2 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mM DTT, 5 μg tRNA, 1 μl reticulocyte lysate reaction mixture and 15 fmol of probe, on ice for 20–30 min. An aliquot of 5 μg of heparin was added to the reaction 10 min before gel electrophoresis. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 6% polyacrylamide gel using a 0.5× TBE buffer (Invitrogen).<br><br>Cell culture and transfection
The <span class="yellow">human</span> retinoblastoma cell line Y79 was cultured and transfected with DNAs as described previously (14,26). Total amounts of transfected DNAs were adjusted to be constant by addition of the empty vector. Either Lipofectin (Invitrogen) or Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) was used for the transfection. For stable transfection, the pCS3+MT expression constructs were co-transfected with a plasmid carrying a neomycin resistant gene and selected by 0.2 mM geneticin (Invitrogen). For differentiation of Y79 cells, cells were plated on the poly-d-lysine-coated plates and then treated with 2.0–2.5 mM sodium butyrate for 4–5 days. HeLa cells were cultured as described and transfected with DNA using Effectene reagent (14,26).<br><br>Immunoblot analysis
Samples that required both protein and mRNA analysis were split upon harvesting. Total cell proteins were subjected to SDS–PAGE and blotted as described previously (26). The primary antibodies used are monoclonal antibodies to a myc-epitope (Invitrogen) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Clontech). Binding of antibodies was detected with the SuperSignal System (Pierce) or ECL (Amersham).<br><br>Immunofluorescent microscopy
HeLa or Y79 cells grown in a four-chamber glass slide were transfected as described above. Cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde 24–48 h after transfection, and permealized with 0.5% Triton X-100 then blocked with 5% <span class="yellow">goat</span> serum. Primary antibodies used were <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-myc (Invitrogen), <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-NMHC-B (29). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 594 <span class="yellow">goat</span> anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 <span class="yellow">goat</span> anti-<span class="yellow">rabbit</span> IgG (Molecular Probes). DAPI was used for DNA staining. Specimens were mounted in ProLong antifed kit (Molecular Probe). The images were collected using Leica SP confocal microscopy (Leica).<br><br>
RESULTS
Tissue-dependent isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 and their subcellular distribution
The A2BP1 mRNAs are detected almost exclusively in brain and striated muscles (heart and skeletal muscles) in adult <span class="yellow">mice</span>, whereas the Fxh mRNAs are expressed in a wide variety of tissues with the highest expression in brain and heart [(21,25) and S. Kawamoto, unpublished data]. These expression profiles prompted us to characterize the mRNAs of A2BP1 and Fxh in brain and muscles. We have cloned cDNAs for two gene transcripts from brain, heart and skeletal muscles by RT–PCR and 5′ RACE. The isolated cDNAs are schematically presented with genomic structures in Figure 1 (for amino acid sequences see also Figure 8). Both gene transcripts are found to undergo tissue-specific alternative splicing. In both cases, brain and striated muscles express unique splice variants generated by mutually exclusive splicing of exons B40 and M43, respectively, which provide different coding sequences in the middle of the carboxyl half of the molecules. Southern blot analysis of the RT–PCR products of the Fxh mRNAs from the different tissues probed by oligonucleotides corresponding to B40 and M43 shows that M43 is exclusively used in heart and skeletal muscles, while B40 is predominantly used in brain (Figure 2A). Digestion of the RT–PCR products of the A2BP1 mRNAs with restriction enzymes unique to B40 and M43 demonstrates that B40 and M43 are used almost exclusively in brain and muscles, respectively (Figure 2B). A2BP1 contains an additional cassette type alternative exon A53, consisting of 53 nt. Inclusion and exclusion of exon A53 results in two different amino acid sequences at the C-terminal region owing to a frame shift. In the case of the A2BP1 gene, moreover, it appears that brain and striated muscle utilize alternative promoters, resulting in different amino acid sequences at the N-terminus. The 5′ RACE of skeletal muscle mRNAs yielded essentially a single species of sequence with 29 unique N-terminal amino acids. The 5′ RACE using brain mRNAs; however, yielded multiple products with multiple deduced amino acid sequences, all of which differ from the muscle amino acid sequence at the very N-terminus. Here, we focus our analysis on a clone containing nine unique amino acids at the N-terminus, which was obtained most frequently. Exon–intron organization of Fxh and A2BP1 shows remarkable similarities and a RRM is encoded in four exons (Figure 1B). Of note is that the significant amounts of Fxh and A2BP1 mRNAs from skeletal muscles are missing a part of the RRM by exon skipping. Typically, as shown in Figure 2C, they lack the 93 nt exon that encodes RNP1, one of the two most critical motifs of the RRM (30). Some of them lack almost the entire RRM (e.g. F402 in Figure 1A).
To examine the subcellular distribution of each isoform of Fxh and A2BP1, myc-tagged proteins were transiently expressed in cultured cells and immunostained with an anti-myc antibody. Initially, HeLa cells were used to investigate subcellular localization, since these cells are more suited for these studies. Representative confocal images are shown in Figure 3A. DAPI and anti-NMHC-B antibodies serve as markers for nuclei and cytoplasm, respectively. As noted, the ratio of protein distributed between nuclei and cytoplasm differs among the proteins. All isoforms of Fxh have a predominant nuclear localization. The brain isoform of A2BP1 without the A53 exon (A016) localizes to both nuclei and cytoplasm, whereas the other brain isoform with the A53 exon (A030) localizes predominantly to cytoplasm with only a minimum being in the nuclei. The relative amounts of both muscle isoforms of A2BP1 (A713 and A715) are somewhat between the amounts of the two brain isoforms. These data are summarized in Figure 1A. The subcellular distribution of representative isoforms (F011, A016 and A030) was also examined in retinoblastoma Y79 cells, which were used as host cells for the transfection experiments in order to characterize splicing activities of Fxh and A2BP proteins (see below). Although Y79 cells have a spherical shape and have only thin cytoplasm, exogenously expressed isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 show a similar subcellular distribution as in HeLa cells (Figure 3B). F011 localizes predominantly to nuclei, A016 to both nuclei and cytoplasm and A030 predominantly to cytoplasm.<br><br>Specific interaction of Fxh and A2BP1 with IDDE via a hexanucleotide UGCAUG
Fxh and A2BP1 share an identical RRM and A2BP1 has been reported to bind specifically to the pentanucleotide GCAUG through this RRM (21). We have previously reported that the IDDE of the NMHC-B transcript, which is indispensable for the regulation of neural cell-specific cassette type exon N30 splicing, has two copies of GCAUG (14). Therefore, we investigated whether Fxh and/or A2BP1 bound to the IDDE. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were carried out using labeled IDDE and in vitro transcribed and translated Fxh and A2BP1, which include a myc-epitope. Since all Fxh and A2BP1 isoforms, except F402 and A704, contain the identical RRM, representative isoforms were analyzed. The expression of F011 in reticulocyte lysate causes the formation of a RNA–protein complex whose migration shift distinguishes it from those of the control reticulocyte lysate (C in Figure 4B, lanes 3 and 10). The unlabeled wild-type IDDE competes with the probe efficiently for the formation of the specific complex C (Figure 4B, lane 4). On the other hand, the mutant mc (Figure 4A), which has a mutation in both copies of UGCAUG, does not (Figure 4B, lane 7). The mutant ma, which has a mutation in the hexanucleotide at the 5′ side, shows less efficient competition, compared with mb, which has a mutation in the 3′ side of the hexanucleotide (Figure 4B, lanes 5 and 6), indicating that the nucleotides at the 5′ side are more important than those at the 3′ side. The presence of an anti-myc antibody, but not a non-specific antibody, inhibits the formation of the specific complex (Figure 4B, lane 8). Synthesis of the full-length F011 protein using a reticulocyte lysate and specificity of the myc antibody for the expressed protein are verified by immunoblot analysis (Figure 4B, lanes 11 and 12). A016 and A030 show essentially identical results to those with F011 (data not shown). These results indicate that Fxh and A2BP1 can bind to the IDDE and that the hexanucleotide UGCAUG is required for their binding.<br><br>Fxh and A2BP1 enhance N30 inclusion in a UGCAUG-dependent manner
To study whether Fxh and A2BP1 regulate neural cell-specific splicing via binding to UGCAUG, the Fxh and A2BP1 expression constructs were co-transfected into retinoblastoma Y79 cells with a number of the reporter minigene constructs, which include the wild-type or a mutant version of UGCAUG in the IDDE (Figure 4A). Minigenes H and J consist of the exons E5, N30 and E6 and their flanking introns with some deletions in the introns. The IDDE with or without mutations in the hexanucleotide is included or excluded between N30 and E6. As described above, each isoform of Fxh and A2BP1 enters the nucleus to a different extent. To see the effects of different proteins on N30 splicing itself, independent of their differential properties in nuclear localization, an exogenous NLS was added to the expressed proteins. Since Fxh and A2BP1 proteins contain the identical RRM, and F011, A016 and A030 all show the same UGCAUG-dependent binding to the IDDE in vitro, F011 and A030 were used for these experiments. Host cells Y79 at the proliferating stage exclude the N30 exon in ∼90% of the endogenous NMHC-B mRNAs (e.g. see Figure 6A, lane 1).
As shown in Figure 4C, the mRNAs derived from minigene J exclude N30 without exogenous expression of Fxh or A2BP1 in Y79 cells, similar to the endogenous NMHC-B mRNAs (Figure 4C, upper panel, lanes 1–5). However, in the presence of exogenous expression of F011 and A030, the N30 inclusion is increased (Figure 4C, upper panel, lanes 7 and 12). The N30 inclusion is absolutely dependent on the presence of the IDDE (Figure 4C, upper panel, lanes 6 and 11). Moreover, mutation of either one of the two copies of UGCAUG (ma, mb) abolishes the inclusion of N30 (Figure 4C, upper panel, lanes 8–10, 13–15). In the context of minigene H, which contains shorter introns, the larger extent of N30 inclusion is induced by either F011 or A030 overexpression (Figure 4C, middle panel, lanes 7 and 12). The N30 inclusion of the minigene H mRNAs also depends on the presence of the IDDE (Figure 4C, middle panel, lanes 6 and 11). Mutation of both copies of UGCAUG (mc) results in a complete loss of N30 inclusion (Figure 4C, middle panel, lanes 10 and 15). The mutant ma shows stronger inhibition of N30 inclusion compared with mb (Figure 4C, middle panel, lanes 8 and 9). This observation is consistent with the competition experiments of the EMSA shown in Figure 4B, indicating that the 5′ hexanucleotide is more important than the 3′ hexanucleotide for binding of Fxh or A2BP1 to the IDDE as well as an activation of N30 splicing. Comparable amounts of F011 and A030 are expressed in each transfection as verified by immunoblots using an anti-myc antibody (Figure 4C, lower panel, lanes 6–17).
Since minigenes J and H lack a portion of the intron between exons N30 and E6 and, therefore, the IDDE is located ∼100 nt downstream of N30, instead of 1.5 kb as in the native gene, we also analyzed the effects of Fxh and A2BP1 on the N30 splicing of the wild-type minigene G, which includes full-length introns among E5, N30 and E6 (Figure 4A). As shown in Figure 4C (right panel), both F011 and A030 are capable of promoting N30 inclusion, with F011 showing a higher activity (Figure 4C, lanes 16 and 17). Although A030 can promote N30 inclusion as efficiently as F011 in the contexts of the minigene J and H transcripts, it can do so less efficiently than F011 in the context of the minigene G transcript. Interpretation of this observation will be discussed below.
Taken together, Fxh and A2BP1 can activate N30 inclusion in an IDDE-dependent manner. The hexanucleotide motif UGCAUG is indispensable for this activation.<br><br>Differential activities of alternatively spliced isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 in promoting N30 inclusion
Both Fxh and A2BP1 mRNAs are expressed in brain and A2BP1 is also expressed in striated muscles and Fxh is expressed in an even wider variety of tissues. As demonstrated above, however, both Fxh and A2BP1 transcripts undergo tissue-dependent alternative splicing, producing muscle-specific and brain-enriched isoforms. Therefore, the relative activity of individual isoform of Fxh and A2BP1 in promoting N30 inclusion was compared using minigene G.
First, in order to evaluate the relative specific activity of each isoform in the splicing reaction separately from its ability to localize to nuclei, an exogenous NLS was included in the expressed protein to equalize the nuclear concentration of the expressed protein in these experiments. Essentially, all of the expressed proteins with the exogenous NLS are localized to the nucleus (data not shown). Therefore, the relative nuclear concentrations of the expressed proteins can be estimated easily by immunoblots. As shown in immunoblots in Figure 5A, similar quantities of proteins are expressed in a dose-dependent manner. Expression of the brain isoform F011 causes a dose-dependent increase in N30 inclusion and the extent of N30 inclusion reaches a plateau with ∼85% of the mRNAs including N30. In contrast, inclusion of N30 promoted by F411, the predominant isoform from skeletal muscles, reaches a plateau with only 40% of the mRNAs. With respect to A2BP1, the brain isoform A030 shows higher activity in N30 inclusion than the muscle isoform A715, which shows almost no activation, as shown in Figure 5A. Including additional isoforms, the activities of individual isoforms with an exogenous NLS in promoting N30 inclusion are shown in Figure 5B (lanes 8–13) and are also summarized in Figure 1A (nls). Special care was taken to ensure that a similar quantity of each protein was expressed and, if not, different amounts were tested to obtain comparable expression. In the presence of the exogenous NLS (nls), F011 and A016 show the highest activities among all isoforms tested. A30 shows a considerably lower activity than A016. Each of the muscle isoforms (F411, A713 and A715) has a lower activity than that of their brain counterparts (F011, A016 and A030, respectively). As expected, isoforms lacking a part or all of the RRM (F402 and A704) have no activity for N30 inclusion.
Next, the splicing activities of the wild-type proteins without an exogenous NLS were examined. Representative data are shown in Figure 5B (lanes 2–7) and the relative activities are summarized in Figure 1A (wt). The protein amounts detected by immunoblots in these experiments represent the total amounts of the proteins distributed to both the nuclei and the cytoplasm. The splicing activities of the wild-type proteins are consistent with the activities that combine the splicing activities of the proteins with the exogenous NLS and the activities of the native proteins to localize to nuclei. In the absence of the exogenous NLS (wt), the brain isoforms F011, and A016 to a lesser extent, are still capable of activating N30 inclusion efficiently. The muscle isoforms for both Fxh and A2BP1 (F411, A713 and A715), as well as the brain isoform A030, show only minimal activities. Therefore, F011 and A016 appear to have the most physiological relevance to N30 splicing activation.<br><br>Overexpression of Fxh and A2BP1 activates N30 inclusion of endogenous NMHC-B mRNAs
The <span class="yellow">human</span> NMHC-B gene consists of 41 constitutive exons and 3 alternative exons. Its pre-mRNA is ∼156 kb in length and it is much more complex than the pre-mRNA from the minigenes. In addition, the minigene pre-mRNAs are driven by a heterologous promoter. Therefore, we next examined if Fxh and A2BP1 were capable of promoting N30 inclusion of the endogenous transcript. Y79 cells were stably transfected with the expression construct for F011 or A016. Both F011 and A016 are enriched in the brain and show higher activation of N30 inclusion in the minigene transcripts. mRNAs encoding endogenous NMHC-B were analyzed by using RT–PCR. As shown in Figure 6, the inclusion of exon N30 with and without another alternative exon, R18, in the endogenous mRNAs is markedly increased in the clones which were stably transfected with the construct for F011 or A016 containing an exogenous NLS (Figure 6, lanes 4 and 5). Although to a lesser extent, transfection of the wild-type constructs without an exogenous NLS also results in a significant increase in N30 inclusion (Figure 6, lanes 2 and 3). Thus, exogenously expressed Fxh and A2BP1 are capable of activating N30 inclusion not only in the transcripts from the minigenes, but also in those from the native NMHC-B gene in Y79 cells.<br><br>Fxh may cooperate with other factor(s) to promote N30 inclusion
To address the role of endogenous Fxh and its potential interaction with other proteins in promoting N30 inclusion, we made use of an isoform of Fxh, F402, which lacks the RRM. The mutant proteins lacking an RRM for other RNA-binding proteins have previously been reported to function in a dominant-negative fashion and inhibit the activities of the wild-type proteins (26,31). Therefore, the effects of F402 on the N30 inclusion of minigene H mRNAs were examined in the context of the Y79 cells treated with butyrate. Upon butyrate treatment, as reported previously, Y79 cells enter in a post-mitotic and differentiated stage, and importantly, the endogenous as well as the minigene mRNAs in those cells include N30 to a large extent, unlike those in the untreated cells that predominantly exclude N30 (14). As shown in Figure 7, in the absence of exogenous expression of F402, large quantities of the mRNAs derived from minigene H-wt, which contains the wild-type IDDE, include N30 (Figure 7, upper panel, lane 4). In contrast, only small quantities of N30 inclusion are detected in the mRNAs from minigene H-mc, which has mutations in both copies of UGCAUG in the IDDE (Figure 7, upper panel, lane 8). Therefore, the butyrate-treated Y79 cells contain factor(s), which are capable of activating the UGCAUG-dependent N30 inclusion. Co-transfection of the wild-type minigene H-wt with the F402 expression construct causes a dose-dependent inhibition of N30 inclusion (Figure 7, lanes 1–3), indicating that F402 has an antagonistic effect on the endogenous factors with respect to N30 inclusion. Notably, the UGCAUG-independent N30 inclusion seen in the mutant minigene H-mc is not affected by the co-expression of F402 (Figure 7, lanes 5–7), indicating that the inhibitory activity of F402 depends on the UGCAUG element. The parallel experiment with the F011 expression construct does not show a significant effect on N30 splicing in either the wild-type or mutant minigene (Figure 7, lanes 9–16). This may be due to the fact that N30 inclusion of the wild-type minigene mRNAs has already reached a maximal level and is consistent with the idea that butyrate-treated Y79 cells contain sufficient amounts of protein(s) functionally equivalent to F011, which can promote N30 inclusion in a UGCAUG-dependent manner. Since F402 does not bind to the UGCAUG element, and has a UGCAUG-dependent antagonistic effect on N30 splicing, it most probably disrupts protein–protein interactions of the endogenous proteins that are required for the UGCAUG-dependent activation of N30 splicing. Endogenous Fxh (and/or A2BP1) would be a good candidate whose function could be antagonized by exogenously expressed F402. Thus, this observation suggests that the endogenous Fxh has an effect on the activation of N30 splicing and that other proteins cooperate with Fxh for N30 activation. Since muscle cells express the RRM-defective isoforms to a significant extent (Figure 2C) and the wild-type F402 localize to nuclei efficiently, this also raises the possibility that the RRM-defective isoforms may have an inhibitory function on the N30 splicing in muscle cells.<br><br>
DISCUSSION
Two major findings are described in this report. First, Fxh and A2BP1 facilitate neural cell-specific inclusion of the cassette-type exon via binding to the specific intronic sequence UGCAUG. In addition to a minigene model system, Fxh and A2BP1 are capable of facilitating N30 inclusion of the endogenous pre-mRNA. This result provides an important demonstration of physiological relevance and supports the notion that the NMHC-B pre-mRNA is likely to be the true target for Fxh or A2BP1-mediated regulation. However, whether the endogenous Fxh or A2BP1 regulates endogenous NMHC-B pre-mRNA splicing needs to be determined in a future study. In vertebrates, small interfering RNAs and gene targeting strategies have recently been used successfully to address the roles of endogenous splicing regulators in alternative splicing of endogenous target pre-mRNAs (8,32–36). A second and more novel finding is the identification of tissue-specific isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 with different splicing activities as well as different subcellular localizations. This finding raises the possibility that the products of the Fxh and A2BP1 genes can contribute to a mechanism as to how tissue specificity of alternative splicing is achieved.
Many splicing factors are detected not only in the nuclei, but also in the cytoplasm (37). They are shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and, in some instances, extracellular stimuli trigger changes in subcellular distribution of these proteins. Such translocations have been reported for hnRNPA1 and PTB (38,39). Moreover, a number of RNA-binding proteins have been demonstrated to play a role in multiple steps during gene expression in different subcellular compartments, such as pre-mRNA processing in nuclei, mRNA export from nuclei to cytoplasm and mRNA localization, stability and translation in cytoplasm (37,40). Therefore, not surprisingly, Fxh and A2BP1 isoforms were found to be distributed in both the nuclei and the cytoplasm in HeLa and Y79 cells. However, the relative ratios of proteins distributed between the two subcellular compartments at steady-state differ among the isoforms. In agreement with Jin et al. (21), substantial amounts of the brain isoform A016 are detected in nuclei. Other A2BP1 isoforms, the brain isoform A030 and the muscle isoforms A713 and A715, are only poorly detected in nuclei. This observation is consistent with the reports where endogenous A2BP1 in cerebellar Purkinje cells, hippocampus neurons and cardiac myocytes were shown to be localized essentially to the cytoplasm (23,24). Thus, inclusion and exclusion of A53 and differences in the very N-terminal sequences results in A2BP1 isoforms with a distinct subcellular localization. It is likely that A2BP1 proteins have multiple roles, involving both nuclear and cytoplasmic events. In contrast, all three Fxh isoforms predominantly localized to the nuclei. Therefore, in terms of their localization, Fxh proteins are better candidates for regulators of the pre-mRNA splicing that takes place in nuclei. Of note, however, our preliminary results of 5′ RACE, as well as the EST database, detect multiple 5′ end sequences for both Fxh and A2BP1 mRNAs, which are presumably generated by alternative promoters and alternative splicing. The diversity of the 5′ end cDNA sequences leads to the generation of a number of unique N-terminal amino acid sequences. Therefore, this study does not exclude the possible existence of other isoforms with different subcellular localizations for both Fxh and A2BP1. Our study also does not exclude the possibility that some of the isoforms translocate between the nucleus and the cytoplasm following stimuli.
The main aim of this study is to determine the relative activities of tissue-dependent isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 in neural cell-specific and UGCAUG element-dependent alternative splicing. To obtain an indication of the relative specific activity of each isoform in transfected cells, the same amounts of the expressed proteins should be available for the splicing reaction in the nuclei. For this reason, an exogenous NLS was included in the expressed proteins. Essentially, all of the expressed proteins with the exogenous NLS localized to nuclei. Thus, the amounts of the expressed proteins determined by immunoblots represent the nuclear concentrations. The analysis using the proteins expressed with the exogenous NLS allowed us to compare directly the splicing activities of these proteins. Furthermore, this analysis also allowed us to define the critical regions of the proteins for splicing activation.
As shown in Figure 5, the splicing activities of the various isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 are intrinsically different, regardless of the subcellular localization properties of the wild-type proteins. Among the isoforms tested in this study, F011 and A016, which include B40, are found to have higher activities in promoting N30 inclusion. When the primary amino acid sequences, outside of the RRM, of these two proteins are compared, the C-terminal regions (amino acids 190–377 of F011) show a higher homology with 71% identity, whereas the N-terminal regions (amino acids 1–112 of F011) show only 53% identity. The C-terminal region includes four subregions of nearly identical stretches of amino acids (Figure 8, I–IV). One subregion (II) includes 13 amino acids encoded by exon B40. Substitution of this subregion with exon M43 in Fxh causes substantial changes in amino acid sequences resulting in only a 21% identity in this region between F011 and F411. Another subregion (IV) is located at the C-terminal end and A030 lacks this homologous region by the inclusion of exon A53, which results in a frame shift. Since F411 and A030 show poor splicing activation compared with F011 and A016, respectively, these two subregions of F011 and A016 appear to serve as activation domains, presumably by interacting with other proteins. This notion is supported by the finding that the RRM-lacking isoform F402, which includes the same subregions II and IV as F011, functions apparently as a dominant-negative mutant to the wild-type Fxh, consistent with the interpretation that the mutant and wild-type are competing to interact with other protein(s). To date, Fyn tyrosine kinase and estrogen receptor-α have been reported to interact with Fxh, and ataxin-2 with A2BP1 (23,41,42). Whether these proteins participate in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing is currently unknown. Of interest, A030 with the exogenous NLS activates N30 splicing as efficiently as F011 in the pre-mRNAs derived from minigenes J and H, which contain the shorter intron, whereas this isoform poorly activates N30 splicing in the pre-mRNA from minigene G, which contains the full-length intron. This observation implies that the interactions of A030 with different factors are required in the different pre-mRNA contexts. Therefore, the isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 described here may have different effects on other UGCAUG-regulated alternative splicing.
The involvement of the hexanucleotide UGCAUG in regulated alternative splicing has been experimentally demonstrated in a number of neural cell-specific, as well as other tissue-specific, model systems (13–21). This hexanucleotide element plays a role, in most cases, as an enhancer in regulating alternative splicing of cassette-type exons as well as mutually exclusive exons. Furthermore, computational analysis has revealed that UGCAUG is over-represented in the introns in which splicing is regulated, compared with the constitutively spliced introns (43). This analysis also pointed to the UGCAUG element as playing a role in the regulation of tissue-specific alternative splicing in a wide range of tissues, but not in specific tissues.
To date, KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP) (44), A2BP1 (21) and Fxh (this study) are known to be capable of binding to UGCAUG. KSRP is expressed ubiquitously and tissue-specific variants of this gene have not been described so far. In this study, we have described the existence of tissue-dependent isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1, which, while not identical in some areas of the molecule, may contain the same RRM. The physiological relevance of these isoforms is that they have different splicing activities and different subcellular localizations. The brain isoforms promote N30 inclusion more efficiently than the muscle isoforms of both Fxh and A2BP1. The isoforms lacking the RRM are normally expressed to a significant extent in skeletal muscles. This isoform is incapable of activating N30 splicing and, moreover, can inhibit N30 inclusion. The properties of these isoforms are consistent with Fxh and A2BP1 acting as regulators for N30 splicing, since N30 is included in neuronal cells, but excluded in muscles. Therefore, despite the tissue-independent occurrence of UGCAUG as a regulatory element, given the tissue-dependent isoforms of the UGCAUG-binding proteins (Fxh and A2BP1) with different activities, the hexanucleotide UGCAUG could confer tissue specificity on regulated splicing. One of the major problems in understanding the mechanisms responsible for alternative pre-mRNA splicing is the manner in which tissue specificity is determined. In vertebrates, to date, only a few tissue-specific proteins have been identified as splicing regulators (8–12). Here, we have shown that the tissue-dependent isoforms of the sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins, which themselves are generated by alternative splicing, have different activities in tissue-specific alternative splicing of target pre-mRNA. Therefore, these isoforms play a role in the determination of tissue specificity of target pre-mRNA splicing. The discovery of these tissue-dependent isoforms of the UGCAUG-binding proteins with different splicing activities adds an important new dimension to the molecular mechanisms responsible for regulating tissue-dependent alternative splicing mediated via UGCAUG.<br><br>
<h3>pmcA2398786</h3>Genomic-Bioinformatic Analysis of Transcripts Enriched in the Third-Stage Larva of the Parasitic Nematode <span class="yellow">Ascaris suum</span>
Abstract
Differential transcription in <span class="yellow">Ascaris suum</span> was investigated using a genomic-bioinformatic approach. A cDNA archive enriched for molecules in the infective third-stage larva (L3) of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> was constructed by suppressive-subtractive hybridization (SSH), and a subset of cDNAs from 3075 clones subjected to microarray analysis using cDNA probes derived from RNA from different developmental stages of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span>. The cDNAs (n = 498) shown by microarray analysis to be enriched in the L3 were sequenced and subjected to bioinformatic analyses using a semi-automated pipeline (ESTExplorer). Using gene ontology (GO), 235 of these molecules were assigned to ‘biological process’ (n = 68), ‘cellular component’ (n = 50), or ‘molecular function’ (n = 117). Of the 91 clusters assembled, 56 molecules (61.5%) had homologues/orthologues in the free-living nematodes <span class="blue">Caenorhabditis elegans</span> and <span class="yellow">C. briggsae</span> and/or other organisms, whereas 35 (38.5%) had no significant similarity to any sequences available in current gene databases. Transcripts encoding protein kinases, protein phosphatases (and their precursors), and enolases were abundantly represented in the L3 of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span>, as were molecules involved in cellular processes, such as ubiquitination and proteasome function, gene transcription, protein–protein interactions, and function. In silico analyses inferred the <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> orthologues/homologues (n = 50) to be involved in apoptosis and insulin signaling (2%), ATP synthesis (2%), carbon metabolism (6%), fatty acid biosynthesis (2%), gap junction (2%), glucose metabolism (6%), or porphyrin metabolism (2%), although 34 (68%) of them could not be mapped to a specific metabolic pathway. Small numbers of these 50 molecules were predicted to be secreted (10%), anchored (2%), and/or transmembrane (12%) proteins. Functionally, 17 (34%) of them were predicted to be associated with (non-wild-type) RNAi phenotypes in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>, the majority being embryonic lethality (Emb) (13 types; 58.8%), larval arrest (Lva) (23.5%) and larval lethality (Lvl) (47%). A genetic interaction network was predicted for these 17 <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> orthologues, revealing highly significant interactions for nine molecules associated with embryonic and larval development (66.9%), information storage and processing (5.1%), cellular processing and signaling (15.2%), metabolism (6.1%), and unknown function (6.7%). The potential roles of these molecules in development are discussed in relation to the known roles of their homologues/orthologues in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> and some other nematodes. The results of the present study provide a basis for future functional genomic studies to elucidate molecular aspects governing larval developmental processes in <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> and/or the transition to parasitism.<br><br>Introduction
Parasitic nematodes are of major socio-economic importance in animals. For example, hundreds of millions of <span class="yellow">people</span> are infected with geohelminths (soil-transmitted worms), such as blood-feeding hookworms <span class="yellow">Ancylostoma duodenale</span> and/or <span class="yellow">Necator americanus</span>, <span class="yellow">Trichuris trichiura</span> and Ascaris spp. [1], causing serious adverse effects on <span class="yellow">human</span> health, particularly in <span class="yellow">children</span>. Similarly, parasitic nematodes of livestock, such as <span class="yellow">pigs</span>, also cause substantial economic losses due to subclinical and clinical diseases, with billions of dollars spent annually on the treatment and control of gastro-intestinal nematodes. In addition to the socioeconomic impact that these parasites have, there is potential for the emergence of resistance in them against all of the main classes of (nematocidal) compounds used to treat the diseases they cause [2]–[5]. Therefore, there is a significant need to work toward discovering new compounds to control these parasites. Gaining an improved understanding of the molecular basis of parasite development provides such an avenue.
Compared with the free-living nematode <span class="blue">Caenorhabditis elegans</span>, there is very little information on fundamental molecular aspects of development in parasitic nematodes [6]–[8]. Since the genome sequence of <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> was published in 1998 [9], many aspects of the molecular biology of this nematode have been elucidated. For instance, microarray analyses have been used to examine developmental and gender-enriched gene expression [10],[11], and the functions of more than 96% of the <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> genes have been assessed by double-stranded RNA interference (RNAi, or gene silencing; [12]) [13]–[18]. Comparative analyses of genetic data sets have shown that parasitic nematodes usually share ∼50–70% of genes with <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> (e.g., [19],[20]). There is similarity in other features (such as basic body plan and moulting) between <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> and parasitic nematodes, suggesting that some molecular pathways are relatively conserved [8],[21]. Understanding the pathways linked to basic nematode biology and development could have important implications for finding new ways of disrupting these pathways and thus facilitate the identification of new drug targets.
Despite the advances in genomic technologies [7], [22]–[29] and the study of <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>, there is a paucity of information on the genomics of parasitic nematodes of animals, particularly in relation to development. Also considering the major socioeconomic impact of Ascaris and ascariasis in <span class="yellow">humans</span> and <span class="yellow">pigs</span> [30]–[32], several characteristics, including the large size of the adult worm (providing the opportunity of investigating individual organ systems and tissues), the ability to maintain Ascaris in the <span class="yellow">pig</span>, store eggs and culture larvae in vitro for relatively long periods of time (months to years) [32] as well as the discovery that RNAi achieves “cross-species” gene silencing for a selected number of genes [33],[34] and the imminent genome sequence (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/Helminths/) all indicate that Ascaris could serve as a powerful model system for investigating reproductive and developmental processes in nematodes.
In the present study, Ascaris from <span class="yellow">pigs</span> was used to study molecules abundantly transcribed in the infective third-stage larva (L3). Following the oral ingestion of Ascaris eggs by the host (<span class="yellow">human</span> or <span class="yellow">pig</span>), L3s are released and then invade/penetrate predominantly the caecal wall [35] to then undergo hepato-pulmonary migration, after which ultimately the adult females and males establish and develop in the small intestine [36],[37]. The molecular mechanisms linked to host invasion and parasite development are largely unknown. Here, we constructed an L3-enriched cDNA library using the method of suppressive-subtractive hybridization (SSH), explored transcription of a representative subset of molecules by microarray analysis and conducted bioinformatic analyses to characterize these molecules, map them to biochemical pathways and predict genetic interactions based on comparisons with <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> and/or other organisms.<br><br>Materials and Methods
Production of Different Developmental Stages of Ascaris
Experimental <span class="yellow">pigs</span> (8–12 weeks of age) were purchased from and maintained in the Experimental Animal Center of South China Agricultural University. These <span class="yellow">pigs</span> were treated humanely, according to the Animal Ethics procedures and guidelines of the People's Republic of China. Adult <span class="yellow">worms</span> (males and females) of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> were collected from the small intestines of <span class="yellow">pigs</span> from an abattoir in Shenzhen, China. Infective eggs and infective L3s of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> were produced according to the methods described previously [38]. In brief, eggs from the uteri of adult females of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> were collected and incubated at 28°C for 28 days to allow them to develop to infective eggs (containing infective L3s). To obtain pure infective L3s, 7.5% v/v sodium hypochlorite was used to treat the larvated eggs at 37°C overnight and then the eggs were shaken with glass-beads; then, the exsheathed L3s and shells were separated by density gradient centrifugation using lymphocyte separating medium (LSM) [38]. Following the experimental infection of helminth-free <span class="yellow">pigs</span> with infective Ascaris eggs as described previously [39], the L3s from livers and in lungs as well as L4s in intestines were isolated according to an established method [40]. All parasite materials were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to storage at −70°C.<br><br>Construction of the cDNA Library by Subtractive-Suppressive Hybridization (SSH)
Total RNA was isolated from adult females and males, different larval stages or eggs of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> using TriPure reagent (Roche) as recommended by the manufacturer. Equal amounts of total RNA from each stage or sex were pooled. The mRNA was isolated using the Oligotex mRNA Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's protocol. SSH was carried out using the PCR-Select cDNA Subtraction kit (Clontech), according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, cDNA synthesized from mRNAs from infective L3s was subtracted against cDNA synthesized from the pooled mRNA from all other stages included herein. The SSH library was constructed using infective L3s as the tester and pooled cDNAs from all other stages as the driver. The effectiveness of this subtraction process has already been demonstrated in previous studies [41],[42]. The cDNA obtained following SSH was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy plasmid vector (Promega) and competent <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span> (JM109) transformed. Positive clones, picked randomly (based on blue/white selection), were grown overnight in Luria Bertani (LB) medium (shaking, 37°C). Individual inserts were PCR-amplified using “nested primers” 1 and 2R from the Subtraction kit (Clontech) and examined by agarose electrophoresis.<br><br>Preparation of Microarray Slides
Clones (n = 3075) from the subtracted library were picked and cultured overnight in LB containing ampicillin (1000 IU/ml) in sealed 96-well blocks. Five µl of culture suspension from each well were transferred into individual wells thermocycling (96-well) plates and the inserts PCR-amplified using primers 1 and 2R. Following a 10 min denaturation step at 94°C, the amplification proceeded for 25 cycles of 10 s at 94°C, 30 s at 68°C and 1.5 min at 72°C, with a final extension for 5 min at 72°C. Products were resolved in agarose gels, ethanol precipitated, re-suspended in 16 µl of “spotting solution” (Shanghai BioStar Genechip, Inc) to a final concentration of ∼500 ng per µl, before being printed on to glass slides (in duplicate) using a robotic arrayer. Sixteen blanks (using spotting solution only) and the same number of negative (irrelevant cDNAs with no relationship to Ascaris) were also printed on to slides and served as negative controls; β-actin of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> served as a positive control to assess the efficiency of labeling and hybridization. The slides were air-dried for 2 h, and cDNA in the spots were cross-linked at 254 mJ. The printed slides were stored at 4°C.<br><br>Labeling of cDNA Probes with Fluorescent Dyes, and Microarray Analysis
The cDNAs produced from total RNA from <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> eggs, infective L3s, L3s isolated from <span class="yellow">pig</span> liver or lung, fourth-stage larvae (L4s), adult males or females [as described in the section ‘Construction of the cDNA Library by Subtractive-Suppressive Hybridization (SSH)’] were labeled with cyanine dyes. Cy3 or Cy5-dCTP was incorporated into cDNA produced from 30 µg of total RNA by direct labeling in a reverse transcription reaction using an oligo (dT) primer. Labeled cDNA was purified using DyeEx columns (Qiagen).
Microarray slides were incubated with a pre-hybridization solution [5×SSC, 1% <span class="yellow">bovine</span> serum albumin (BSA), 0.1% sodium dodecyl-sulphate (SDS)] for 6 h at 42°C. After pre-hybridization, the microarray slides were incubated with ‘pooled’ Cy3 and Cy5-labeled probes in hybridization solution (5×SSC, 1% BSA, 0.1% SDS), in the dark at 42°C for 18 h, and then washed in solution I (1×SSC, 0.2% SDS) for 10 min, followed by solution II (0.1×SSC, 0.2% SDS) for 10 min at 60°C, according to the protocols provided by Shanghai BioStar Genechip, Inc. A “dye flip” was carried out to control for any bias in hybridization signal between the Cy-labeled cDNA probes (produced for two distinct mRNA populations). The slides were dried and scanned (ScanArray 4000 scanner) using image acquisition software (Shanghai BioStar Genechip Inc.) and a range of laser power and photo-multiplier tube intensities. The mean hybridization signal (derived from four replicates of the same array) were corrected for background, normalized [43], log2-transformed and then subjected to statistical analysis employing the students t-test in a spreadsheet (Excel, Microsoft, USA). The microarray data were analysed for differential cDNA hybridization (>2.0-fold to 114.3-fold) between L3 and each of the other stages (eggs, lung and liver L3s, L4, adult female and adult male).<br><br>Verification of Differential Hybridization by Reverse Transcription-Coupled Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Analysis
For a subset (n = 17) of representative ESTs (rESTs), RT-PCR was used to verify the differential transcription recorded by microarray analysis. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from total RNA (separately) from each stage or sex of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> using reverse transcriptase (Superscript III, Invitrogen). Briefly, 5 µg of total RNA were added to 14 µl of H2O and 1 µl of oligo d(T)n = 12–18 primer (0.5 µg/µl), heated to 70 °C for 10 min and chilled on ice. First- and second-strand cDNAs were synthesized via the addition of 4 µl of first-strand cDNA buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 375 mM KCl and 15 mM MgCl2), 2 µl of 0.1 M dithiothreitol, and 1 µl of 10 mM of each dNTP, followed by an incubation at 25 °C (10 min), 42 °C (50 min) and 70 °C (15 min). One-tenth of each double-stranded cDNA produced was then used as a template in the PCR. The transcripts were amplified from individual cDNAs by PCR using oligonucleotide primers (sequences available upon request) designed to each EST. The PCR amplification of a portion (209 bp) of the β-actin gene (accession no. BI594141) using forward primer (5′-CTCGAAACAAGAATACGATG-3′) and reverse primer (5′- ACATGTGCCGTTGTATGATG-3′), previously determined to be present in all developmental stages and both sexes of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> [44], served as a positive control. Samples without template (no-DNA controls) were included in each PCR run. The following cycling conditions were employed: one cycle at 94 °C (5 min), 94 °C (30 s), 60 °C (30 s) and 72 °C (30 s) for 30 cycles, followed by a final extension of 70 °C (7 min). Following the PCR, 5 µl of individual amplicons were resolved in ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels (2%) and then photographed upon transillumination. The relative band intensities were analyzed using UVIsoft Image Acquisition and Analysis software (UVITEC). The specificity and identity of individual amplicons were confirmed by direct sequencing using the same primers (separately) as employed for their amplification.<br><br>Sequencing and Bioinformatics Analyses
Clones from the SSH cDNA library with increased hybridization in microarray analysis to the infective L3 compared with other stages were sequenced using standard technology [45]. The nucleotide sequences have been deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers ES290984-ES291074. Following the processing of the sequences (i.e., removal of vector sequences, quality assurance and clustering), contigs or singletons from individual clusters were subjected to BLASTx (NCBI: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and BLASTn (EMBL-EBI Parasite Genome Blast Server: www.ebi.ac.uk) analysis to identify putative homologues in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>, other nematodes and other organisms (e-value of ≤1e-05). Peptides inferred from ESTs were classified functionally using Interproscan (available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/InterProScan/) employing the default search parameters. WormBase (www.wormbase.org) was interrogated extensively for relevant information on <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> homologues/orthologues, including RNAi phenotypic, transcriptomic, proteomic and interactomic data. ESTs with homologues/orthologues in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> and other nematodes were also subjected to analysis employing the KEGG Orthology-Based Annotation System (KOBAS) (www.kobas.cbi.pku.edu.cn), which predicts the biochemical pathways in which molecules are involved. The open reading frames (ORFs) inferred from selected ESTs with orthologues in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> were also subjected to “secretome analysis” using the program SignalP v.2.0 www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/), employing both the neural network and hidden Markov models to predict signal peptides and/or anchors [46]–[48]. Also, transmembrane domains were predicted using the program TMHMM (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/; [49]–[51]), and subcellular localization inferred employing the program WoLF PSORT (http://wolfpsort.org/; [52]).
The method established by Zhong and Sternberg [53] was used to predict the interactions for <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> orthologues of the L3-enriched molecules from Ascaris. In brief, interaction, phenotypic, expression and gene ontology data from <span class="yellow">fruitfly</span>, <span class="yellow">yeast</span>, <span class="yellow">mouse</span> and <span class="yellow">human</span> were integrated using a naïve Bayesian model to predict genetic interactions among <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> genes ([45],[53]; Zhong and Sternberg, unpublished). The predicted networks resulting from the analyses were saved in a graphic display file (gdf) format and examined using the graph exploration system available at http://graphexploration.cond.org/. Images were labeled and saved in the joint photographic experts group (jpeg) format.<br><br>
Results
To identify molecules transcribed abundantly in the L3 of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span>, an enriched cDNA library was constructed by SSH. From a total of 3075 clones from this library, 2921 (95%) were shown to contain an insert (which could be amplified by PCR). From 2671 (92%) of these clones, amplicons representing single bands of ∼400 to 600 bp in size were produced. These latter amplicons were arrayed (in duplicate) on to slides and then hybridized with Cy3-labeled L3-cDNA or with Cy5-labeled cDNA from eggs, liver/lung L3s, L4s, adult female or adult male of Ascaris. Dye flip was conducted to verify the hybridization data. Of the 2671 (duplicate) spots, 1526 had a significant difference in hybridization between infective L3 cDNA and cDNAs from all other stages or sexes of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span>, of which 515 had a >2.0-fold increased hybridization for the L3.
In order to independently verify the hybridization results in the microarray, a PCR-based analysis of a selected subset (n = 17) clones was conducted using specific primer pairs. Having verified the specificity and identity of individual amplicons by sequencing, PCR results were reproducible (based on multiple runs on different days) and ∼94% (16 of 17) concordant with those of the microarray analysis (not shown). There was complete concordance for representative clones associated with a differential signal of ≥3.0-fold in the microarray.
The clones linked to the 515 spots representing increased transcription (>2.0-fold) in infective L3 compared with the other developmental stages or sexes included were subjected to sequencing. The 498 sequences (length: 550±115 bp) determined were then subjected to detailed bioinformatic analyses. There were 91 unique clusters (accession numbers ES290984-ES291074), of which 55 were singletons (sequences determined once). Of 56 molecules (61.5%) with significant similarity to sequences other than <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> in the databases interrogated, 50 (54.9%) had <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> or <span class="yellow">C. briggsae</span> homologues, and six had similarity to ESTs already sequenced from ascaridoid and/or other parasitic nematodes, and/or other organisms (Table 1). A significant proportion (38.4%) did not have any similarity in sequence to any organisms for which data are presently available. Comparative analysis specifically against <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> EST data sets (n∼42,000) available in public databases confirmed independently that the majority of molecules (>60%) were present exclusively in the infective L3 stage or were orphans.
As gene ontology (GO) provides a hierarchy that unifies the descriptions of biological, cellular and molecular functions [54], this approach was employed to predict the classification and gene function of molecules enriched in infective L3 of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span>. A summary of the GO categories of these molecules is displayed in Fig. 1. Of the 91 contigs, 32 (35%) could be functionally assigned to ‘biological process’ (n = 38), ‘cellular component’ (n = 17) and ‘molecular function’ (n = 64). The most common subcategories were gluconeogenesis (13%) and metabolic process (13%) within ‘biological process’, extracellular region (24%) within ‘cellular component’, and catalytic activity (11%) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity (8%) within ‘molecular function’ (Table S1).
A focused KOBAS analysis inferred the 50 <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> orthologues/homologues to be involved in apoptosis and insulin signaling (2%), ATP synthesis (2%), carbon metabolism (6%), fatty acid biosynthesis (2%), gap junction (2%), glucose metabolism (6%) or porphyrin metabolism (2%), although 34 (68%) of them could not be mapped to a specific metabolic pathway (Table 2). Of these 50 molecules, small numbers were predicted to be secreted (10%), anchored (2%) and/or transmembrane (12%) proteins (Table 2). Functionally, 17 (34%) of the 50 molecules were associated with (non-wild-type) RNAi phenotypes in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>, the majority displaying embryonic lethality (Emb) (13 types; 58.8%), larval arrest (Lva) (23.5%) and larval lethality (Lvl) (47%) (Table 2).
Extending this analysis, a relatively complex genetic interaction network was predicted for the 17 <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> orthologues (i.e., with non-wild-type RNAi phenotypes) (see Table S2). Statistically highly significant interactions were predicted for nine of the <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> genes; the top five interactors are displayed in Fig. 2. The gene ontology categories for eight selected <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> genes (F33D11.10, F55A12.8, kin-2, mec-12, mup-2, pab-1, rpl-22 and T21B10.2) included: embryonic development, egg hatching, larval development and/or growth. The other categories included: positive regulation of growth rate (F55A12.8, kin-2, mup-2, pab-1, rpl-22 and T21B10.2) and gamete generation and locomotory behaviour (kin-2, mup-2, pab-1 and F55A12.8, kin-2, mup-2, respectively). The <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> homologue egl-3 was predicted to be involved in proteolysis (see www.wormbase.org). All nine <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> orthologues were predicted to interact directly with a total of 296 (range: 5–75) other genes and, in particular, a direct genetic interaction was predicted between pab-1 and T21B10.2 (Fig. 2). The 296 interactors were associated with embryonic and larval development (n = 198; 66.9%), information storage and processing (n = 15; 5.1%), cellular processes and signalling (n = 45; 15.2%) and metabolism (n = 18; 6.1%); the precise function of some of the interactors (n = 20; 6.7%) is presently unknown (Table S2).<br><br>Discussion
The present study investigated transcripts in infective L3s of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> using a genomic-bioinformatic platform. The focus was on comparisons with <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> homologues/orthologues, because the entire genome sequence of this nematode is known [9] and because there is a wealth of information on the localization and functionality of its molecules (www.wormbase.org; http://elegans.bcgsc.bc.ca/knockout.shtml). The functions of most genes in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> have been assessed using RNAi (e.g., [14],[15],[17],[55],[56]) in the hermaphroditic stage, whereas there is a paucity of functional information available for Ascaris and other parasitic nematodes of animals [57],[58].
Following the microarray analysis of >2500 ESTs from the SSH library, 498 cDNAs inferred to be enriched in the L3, based on hybridization signal, were sequenced and subjected to comprehensive in silico analyses. Of the 91 clusters of molecules categorized, 50 (54.9%) had <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> homologues/orthologues with loss-of-function phenotypes could be mapped to key pathways. The statistically significant genetic interactions predicted for 9 of the 50 <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> orthologues [namely egl-3, F33D11.10, F55A12.8, kin-2, mec-12, mup-2, pab-1, rpl-22 and T21B10.2 ( = enol-1)] and the interaction network included genes encoding kinases, alpha-tubulins, enolases, troponin and other named and unnamed proteins. Eight of these molecules (enol-1, pab-1, F33D11.10, rpl-22, F55A12.8 mec-12, mup-2 and kin-2) have known or predicted roles in embryonic and larval growth and development, gamete generation, locomotory behaviour or other biological processes in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> (see www.wormbase.org).
The enolase encoded by enol-1 is predicted to play a role in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis (cf. [59]). Since glucose is the main source for ATP production, the alteration in these key glycolytic enzymes may lead to cellular dysfunction, such as impaired ion-motive ATPase required to maintain potential gradients, operate pumps and maintain membrane lipid asymmetry [60]. Bioinformatic analysis for transmembrane helices (TMHMM) and peptide signal sequences (SignalP) predicted ENOL-1 to be a non-secreted protein localized to the cytoplasm (cf. Table 2). Nonetheless, enolases are often detected in the excretory/secretory (ES) products of parasitic helminths, including adult <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> [61], and appear to play a role in the triggering of nitric oxide production by host cells. The enol-1 orthologue of <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> has been predicted to interact specifically with the polyadenylate binding protein gene, pab-1, inferred to be involved in coordinated gene transcription and expression during normal larval development [16]. Poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) are recognized to be central to the regulation of mRNA translation and stability [62]. Present evidence suggests that the expression of PAB-1 is regulated by an oligo-pyrimidine tract in response to cell growth and relates to coordinated growth regulation in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> [62]. Furthermore, gene silencing of pab-1 and its selected interactors (see Fig. 2) leads to embryonic lethal (Emb), slow growth (Slo) and sterile progeny (Stp) phenotypes (see www.wormbase.org).
Another gene (F33D11.10; EST code 4F10; see Table 2) which encodes an ATP-dependent RNA helicase and is associated with embryonic lethal (Emb) and larval lethal (Lvl) RNAi phenotypes, was shown to be highly transcribed in infective L3s of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span>. Helicases are involved in a variety of RNA metabolic processes, including translation initiation, pre-mRNA splicing, pre-rRNA processing, rRNA maturation and RNA degradation [63], and are crucial for life cycle progression, sex determination and early embryogenesis in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> [60]. The high transcription levels of a homologue/orthologue in the L3 of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> might suggest a similar role in this ascaridoid. Similarly, the coordination of the expression of a large number of genes is required for normal growth and cell proliferation during larval development. The high transcription level for the ribosomal protein gene homologue rpl-22 (large subunit family member; EST code 26G12, see Table 2) in the infective L3 of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> compared with other developmental stages is likely to reflect the substantial rate of cell growth in this stage [64].
The gene (F55A12.8, EST code 4G11; see Table 2) encoding an acetyl-transferase with a putative ATPase domain, shown to be enriched in the L3 of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span>, was predicted to interact with 75 other genes all involved in energy production and/or RNA processing (see Table S2). Several molecules involved in ATP synthesis and mitochondrial pathways (e.g., cytochrome oxidase c subunits 1, 2 and 3, ADP/ATP translocases, NADH dehydrogenases, ATPases and ATP synthetases) have been reported previously to be highly represented in the L3 stage of <span class="yellow">Anisakis simplex</span> [65], thus supporting the proposal that substantial energy is required for larval development as well as the transition from the free-living to the parasitic stage and the invasion of the host. There is also likely to be a substantial energy requirement for muscle contraction linked to larval motility in <span class="yellow">A. suum</span>, as the L3s penetrate the caecal wall in the porcine host, before undergoing hepato-pulmonary migration [35]. Accordingly, genes encoding a specialized tubulin expressed in mechanoreceptors (mec-12, EST code 13E09) and a troponin (mup-2, EST code 01G03; see Table 2), both predicted to interact with a total number of 32 tubulin- and myosin-encoding genes, also supported a link to extensive muscle contraction and motility in <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> L3s. Also, neuroactive peptides are required to regulate the responsiveness of nematode larvae to mechanical stimuli [66]. A homologue encoded by egl-3 was shown to be highly transcribed in the L3 of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span>; EGL-3 is predicted to be a pro-hormone convertase involved in the maturation of neuropeptides and could be associated with mechano-sensory responses and touch sensitivity linked to the host invasion.
A regulatory subunit of a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (kin-2, EST code 22H01; see Table 2) was predicted to interact with 72 other genes all involved in diverse cellular processes, such as nuclear trafficking, and DNA replication and repair (see Table S2). Based on gene ontology terms, kin-2 is implicated in gamete generation, growth, larval development, post-embryonic body morphogenesis, signal transduction and/or protein amino acid phosphorylation (see Table S2). Gene silencing of kin-2 in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> leads to phenotypes, such as larval lethal (Lvl), larval arrest (Lva), body morphology defect (Bmd), dumpy (Dpy), uncoordinated (Unc) and sterile progeny (Stp) (www.wormbase.org), suggesting that its homologue in <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> is central to larval maturation. The KOBAS analysis predicted the protein KIN-2 to be involved in the insulin-signaling pathway, previously implicated in controlling the exit from dauer in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> and the activation of L3s of the <span class="yellow">canine hookworm</span>, <span class="yellow">Ancylostoma caninum</span>, following exsheathment [67]. In a recent study, Brand and Hawdon [68] were able to inhibit (with a phosphoinositide-3-OH-kinase inhibitor) the activation of infective L3s of both of the hookworms <span class="yellow">Ancylostoma caninum</span> and <span class="yellow">Ancylostoma ceylanicum</span> via the insulin signaling pathway, thus lending some credence to the hypothesis that this pathway plays an critical role in regulating the transition from the free-living to the parasitic stage [68]. Recently, it has been proposed that transcriptional and feeding responses to serum-stimulation in <span class="yellow">Ancylostoma caninum</span> are regulated by parallel systems, with the insulin signaling pathway playing a significant role in the ‘resumption of feeding’ in activated larvae [69].
Protein kinases are also likely to be involved in pathways linked to sexual maturation in developing larvae. As already proposed for adult stages of <span class="yellow">H. contortus</span> [45], the protein kinase gene cdk-1 is predicted to play a pivotal role in the germline, oogenesis and spermiogenesis pathways of this parasitic nematode. Other protein kinases, such as PEPCK, and phosphatases, were shown herein to be transcribed at high levels in the L3 stage compared with other developmental stages of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> (see Table 2), which is in accordance to findings reported recently for <span class="yellow">Anisakis simplex</span> [65]. Due to their major regulatory effects in eukaryotic signaling events and regulatory and sensory functions, protein kinases have been considered interesting targets for anti-parasitic drugs [70].
In conclusion, this study has given some interesting insights into early molecular processes in the L3 of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span>. Approximately 60% of the transcripts enriched in the L3 stage of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> have homologues/orthologues in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>. The bioinformatic analyses of selected molecules suggest that a complex genetic network regulates or controls larval growth and development in <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> L3s, and some of these might be involved in or regulate the switch from the free-living to the parasitic stage. Some caution is warranted in drawing conclusions regarding molecular mechanisms regulating the transition to parasitism in parasitic nematodes from information on <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>, as latter is a free-living nematode. Also, while the method of data integration is essential for the reliable prediction of genetic interactions, it might limit the capacity of the approach somewhat to infer nematode-specific interactions. As additional datasets of genes and gene functions become available for various parasitic nematodes, more informed inferences can be made regarding the functions of nematode-specific genes, particularly those involved in the transition to parasitism. The imminent genome sequence of <span class="yellow">A. suum</span> (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/Helminths/) should all assist in this endeavour. Also, functional analysis of selected molecules representing selected ESTs identified herein, utilizing gene silencing approaches established recently [33],[34], could provide some insights into developmental processes in Ascaris and related ascaridoid nematodes and provide avenues for the development of novel approaches for their control.<br><br>Supporting Information<br><br>

Abstract
Many species have been shown to contain tandemly repeated short sequence DNA known as minisatellites and simple sequence motifs. Due to allelic variation in the copy number of the repeat unit these loci are usually highly polymorphic. Here we demonstrate the presence of sequences in the genome of the nematode <span class="blue">Caenorhabditis elegans</span> which are homologous to two sets of short sequence DNA. However, when two independent strains were compared no polymorphism for these sequences could be detected.Images<br><br><br><br><br><br>

Due to allelic variation in the copy number of the repeat unit these loci are usually highly polymorphic. Here we demonstrate the presence of sequences in the genome of the nematode <span class="blue">Caenorhabditis elegans</span> which are homologous to two sets of short sequence DNA. However, when two independent strains were compared no polymorphism for these sequences could be detected. <br><br> INTRODUCTION <br><br> The genome of many species, including lower organisms, contain minisatellite sequences and so-called simple sequence motifs (1,2,3). Due to extensive variation in the number of repeat units, many of these loci have been shown useful as polymorphic markers, e.g. for genetic linkage studies and identification purposes. <br><br> Here we demonstrate that the genome of the nematode <span class="blue">Caenorhabditis elegans</span> contains sequences that are homologous to the minisatellite core sequence 33.6 (1) and to the simple sequence motif (AGC)n. Surprisingly, these sequences did not display polymorphism when two independent <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> strains, Bristol and Bergerac, were compared. <br><br> MATERIALS AND METHODS Genomic DNA from nematodes <br><br> Genomic DNA was isolated according to standard procedures from the two strains Bergerac (BO) and Bristol (strain N2). These strains are derived from two different individual <span class="yellow">worms</span> isolated in France and England, respectively. Southern blotting <br><br> Genomic DNA digests (5 Ag) were separated in a 1 % agarose gel in 1 x TAE (40 mM Tris.HCl, pH 7.4/20 mM sodium acetate/I mM NaEDTA) by electrophoresis at 75 V for 16 h. Separation patterns were transferred to Zetaprobe membrane (BIORAD) in 0.4 N NaOH, 0.6 M NaCl in a vacu-blot apparatus (LKB) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The minisatellite and simple sequence probes used were prepared essentially as described (5). The Tcl probe is a plasmid containing an insert of the transposable element Tcl (4). All probes were labelled by random-priming. Hybridization was performed for 12 h in 7 % SDS, 0.5 M phosphate buffer, 1 mM Na2EDTA at 650C. Blots were washed twice in 2.5 x SSC at 650C and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film with intensifying screens. Exposure times are indicated in Fig. 1. <br><br> ( IRL Press <br><br> Nucleic Acids Research <br><br> Volume 17 Number 23 1989 <br><br> 9527 <br><br> Nucleic Acids Research <br><br> <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> <br><br> N      0$       8 <br><br> _ _ <br><br> :  , s , ..e :*. ,~ :::::<br><br> . 4i <br><br> .t_:  -::?J?.: <br><br> i-  <br><br> .a <br><br> E?:< . :: y : <br><br> *01 <br><br> 4?j* <br><br> .-I <br><br> kb - 27 <br><br> - 9A - <br><br> : .::....... <br><br> Mi ....  - 4v3 <br><br> IC .3 <br><br> If.0r <br><br> MW <br><br> !5 c6 <br><br> I <br><br> " R  1d~ ! ;,<br><br> Figure 1.

The latter probe contains a member of the Tcl family of transposable elements which is present in different copy numbers in the two different strains (4). The hybridization patterns of probes 33.6 and (AGC)n obtained after Hae Im and Rsa I digestion and the differences in intensities of the hybridizing bands is reminiscent of DNA-fingerprint patterns obtained with these probes in other species (1,2,3). However, identical hybridization patterns for the two strains with the three enzymes tested indicated that in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> these sequences are monomorphic (Fig. 1). Based on the number of hybridizing bands we estimate the <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> genome to contain about 30 33.6 homologous loci and about 20 (AGC)n homologous loci. <br><br> Rehybridization of the same blot with a Tcl probe revealed extensive RFLPs due to the different copy number of the transposon in the two strains, a phenomenon which has been described previously by others (4). <br><br> DISCUSSION <br><br> The findings presented in this paper indicate that polymorphism of minisatellite sequences and simple sequence motifs, is not a general phenomenon in animal species. So far, only some species of whales have displayed similar high levels of monomorphism (6). In other species thus far tested both minisatellites and simple sequences display high to very high levels of polymorphism. It should be noted, however, that at least in <span class="yellow">humans</span>, a substantial part of the minisatellites detected by core probes also displays high levels of monomorphism as analysed by cloning (1) or by two-dimensional DNA fingerprinting (5). <br><br> The fact that nematodes are hermaphrodites, and thus inbred, might be a contributing factor to the observed lack of polymorphism. However, the high levels of polymorphism detected by the Tcl probe do not indicate a general absence of events causing genetic variation. Indeed, Eide and Anderson (7) showed that tandemly repeated duplications in the unc-54 gene of <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> revert at high frequencies. Since in all cases the revertants had the normal genomic configuration this suggests that unequal crossing-over does occur in the nematode. <br><br> A more likely explanation for the monomorphic nature of the sequences detected with 33.6 and (AGC)n in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> is selection against sequence variants at these loci. This might be the result of the presence of a particular subset of minisatellites and/or simple sequences at sites in the genome of this organism, e.g. in coding sequences, in which variation in copy number of repeat units cannot be tolerated. An example of such a coding sequence could be the High Mobility Group proteins which usually have stretches of identical (acidic) amino acids (2,8). An interesting observation in this respect is the demonstration of the absence of any protein polymorphisms in electrophoretic comparisons for 24 different enzymes between the Bristol and Bergerac strains (9). An important step in understanding this phenomenon will therefore be the isolation and analysis of individual homologous minisatellite and simple sequence loci from a genomic library of <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>. <br><br> REFERENCES <br><br> 1.
