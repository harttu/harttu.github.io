Abstract<br><br><br><br><br><br> Medical History, 1990, 34: 178-184. <br><br> IN SPITE OF MEDICAL HELP: THE PUZZLE OF AN <br><br> EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY PRIME MINISTER'S <br><br> ILLNESS <br><br> by <br><br> MARJORIE BLOY * <br><br> Charles Watson Wentworth, second Marquis of Rockingham, died suddenly and unexpectedly on 1 July 1782, when he was only 52 years old. He had suffered-or enjoyed-ill health all his life but in 1782 appeared to be no worse than he had ever been. His death in London terminated his second period of office as Prime Minister, to which he had been appointed only 14 weeks earlier. In May he had reported to the Duke of Portland that he had "for some weeks past undergone much Pain and much inconvenience from something similar to my old Complaint in my Side and Stomach" but that he felt much better than he had.' By 17 June he was recovering from both influenza and his "old complaint".2 On 1 July he died and on the 20th he was interred in York Minster. <br><br> The first recorded bout of illness suffered by the marquis, then Lord Higham, was in July 1741 when the 11-year-old was "a little indisposed, something Feaverish I guess it proceeds from Worms and will Soon be removed".3 He also had a rash and it was thought that the cause of the problem was that the <span class="blue">boy</span> had overheated himself.4 He was still ill at the beginning of August: he had been "much out of order" for a long time but had been recommended to take warm baths by Dr Wilmot and Mr Ranby when they were consulted in London.5 Charles's aunt, Lady Isabella Finch, was sure that the baths "and other Things They'll prescribe will in a short Time entirely Cure his Complaints w[hic]h neither of Them thought proceed from any dangerous Causes".6 In spite of Lady Isabella's hopes, Charles did not greatly improve, even though his mother believed that he continued mending every day.

The doctors hoped that it would burst outwards "which they assure me will be the safest way and give the poor Monkey but very little pain' 7 <br><br> On 20 August Lord Winchelsea, Higham's uncle, surprised to see the <span class="blue">boy</span> so well and brisk, hoped that Charles was "now safe from this complaint"-the same one from which he had suffered in 1738-39-but thought that he would never be safe "if he continues the practice of overheating himself and then drinking Cold Water". He said that Charles was of a "pretty healthy strong Constitution";8 Lady Malton was not so sure. The same day she wrote a progress report to her husband saying that Charles's swelling continued to grow, as did the pain "in that part (but not the lease [sic] trouble in making Water or going to Stool) & less Fever than c[oulJd be imagined where Matter is as they now imagine certainly gathering and must end in an operation". In spite of it all, Charles was in fine spirits.9 Lady Malton dosed the <span class="blue">boy</span> with <span class="yellow">cinchona</span> bark, which removed the pains in his legs and reduced his fever, and she was convinced that they would soon have "a clear Stage to act in a proper manner a[bou]t his other Complaints w[hic]h the Learned assure me are to be conquered also". 10 Charles was soon allowed to eat meat and Mr Ranby still assured her that the swelling would break outwards. 1 " Three days later he decided to lance it, even though Dr Bourne disagreed. The <span class="blue">boy</span>'s mother was puzzled because the swelling "sometimes pushes forward very fast then retires a little" but the doctor and Ranby seemed happy with his condition.'2 At this point the letters cease, presumably because Malton arrived in London with his daughters, to have them inoculated against <span class="yellow">smallpox</span>, but a later letter states that surgery to open the swelling was not undertaken. 13 <br><br> By the end of October the correspondence had recommenced. Charles was ill again. He was just the same as when he left Kensington, so John Bourne had bled him and the <span class="yellow">child</span> had started on Sir Edward Hulse's prescription, unfortunately not defined in the letter, but which was apparently as bad as the last one, if not worse. Lady Malton thought that "with such a State of Blood the Continuation of Health cannot be expected" but was hopeful that the "Cinnabar may prove a more Efficacious remedie than any than has been tryed yet""."4 That night she applied "a Blister ... without the least Symptom or tendency to anything like Strangury". He bore the treatment well, as he had done three years previously, and it seemed so successful that Lady Malton was "determined to keep it running full as long as I did last time by the help of John Borne [sic] with much ease to the Dear <span class="yellow">Child</span>".'5 She <br><br> 7 WWM, M7-51.

Charles found her treatment "not near the pain he expected" and she was "full of hopes that he will rec[eiv]e great benefit from it".1 <br><br> Apart from his other troubles, one of Charles's knees had swollen but this had much abated since the application of the blisters which Lady Malton believed "must be acting upon the whole Mass of Blood" since it had "reached the remote part". She thought that Sir Edward Hulse's powders were too slow in taking effect although the <span class="blue">boy</span> took them very quietly.'7 Sir Edward did not "apprehend any great danger from the Siziness [thickness] of Charles' blood"; Lady Malton thought that the condition was the cause of all the <span class="yellow">child</span>'s problems, which would not end until it was set to rights. At any rate, he was fit enough to go hunting.'8 Charles continued in the same state of health. He slept well at night, ate more than his mother thought was good for him, and was able to exercise strenuously without tiring. He put on no weight though, and "as for them swellings at his throat, they are almost gone one day and rise the next". His mother did not expect a speedy recovery and "if the D[octo]rs think him in a good state of health now, I s[houl]d be glad to see him in a better".'9 He began to improve and by the end of November even she thought he was on the mend and gaining weight.20 Unfortunately, Lady Malton again had cause for concern over his health in January 1742 when he began to suffer from an intermittent hoarseness.2' Otherwise he was as well as one could expect, with no other complaints.22 It was not to last. <br><br> In May 1742 Charles and his mother were again in Bristol, taking the waters because he had been indisposed. Lady Malton thought the waters were doing them good because they were both being violently sick.23 However, Charles had had no dinner on 25 or 26 May and was hot, lazy, and inclined to stir, "from which I conclude he is not well, . . . and therefore Intend to give him a gentle Vomit ... and to let him take his old Remedie the Salt Draughts for a few Daies which I dare say will set him quite to rights".24 By 29 May Dr Boume had bled the <span class="blue">boy</span> "which succeeded very well but ... found it [his blood] as bad as ever". The waters were not working "but there is a great deal for them to do which grant God they may effect". The weather had turned warm so Lady Malton had "shorn him ... which has display'd a most scabby head and indeed several other untoward Blotches he has out upon other parts of his Body", which made her uneasy.25 The blotches on his head were not numerous "yet they made up in quality for so virulent a Corrosive Humour is not easily conceived without seeing it". The pustules on his body were of the same sort <br><br> 16 WWM, M7-17. Lady to Lord Malton, 4 November 1741. 7 WWM, M7-18. Lady to Lord Malton, 4 November 1741. 18 WWM, M7-16.

Charles was also feverish; his glands were swollen and his pulse was erratic "but out of compassion to you I must tell you that he is with me as Brisk and lively as you ever Saw him". Lady Malton had called in two eminent Bristol <span class="yellow">men</span>, Dr Logan and Mr Pye, to treat the <span class="blue">boy</span>; Mr Pye prescribed "the Precipitate Per se" as the cure for the "hectic". Pye made it himself and said that it was the only remedy that would work. Clearly Charles was impatient to be cured because he told his mother to give him the medicine "to cure me which I am sure it will do or shoot me through the head at once". She thought that this attitude was "odd from one of his Age and [it] does not a little disturb".26 The blotches began to burst and indent but the doctor thought that all would be well in the end.27 Meanwhile, Charles was still losing weight even though "he had none to spare before" and he was inclined to be lazy which was not his natural turn. His father recommended some unknown cure which he called Gascoin's Powder-a dose of five grains made up with syrup into a pill-every night. <br><br> To make matters worse, the doctors disagreed about the treatment. "Dr Pye is Vehemently for the P. Per se, Dr Logan saies that it is a Medicine that may prove too rough in its operation for his Constitution & therefore begs a tryal of Beazor mineral [gall stones from a <span class="yellow">goat</span>] and Viper Broth". The Bristol water had not yet acted "because his case is of too obstinate a Nature" and Lady Malton herself was satisfied that since nothing else had worked to cure the <span class="blue">boy</span>, the time had come to try mercurials, even though she knew that they were "powerful and perhaps in some cases hazardous medicines".28 She wanted to see some remedy succeed but was "afraid of violent ones and at the same time vastly distrustfull [sic] of mild ones". It would appear that the "precipitate Per se", probably mercury-based, could be a kill-or-cure remedy. Her "terrors" did not arise from any immediate danger to her son, and her "perfect Knowledge" of his disorder convinced her that whatever remedies he took, the cure was in the hands of God.29 <br><br> To add to Charles' disorders, on 12 June he developed a "very inflamed bad Eye ... the same Eye that ... he did not see so well of [as] the other ... He sais [sic] that from that eye Alone he can Scarcely distinguish anything". The doctors suggested bathing the eye: Lady Malton knew that the "frightful symptoms" which were "shocking to behold" were a result of "the Same as produces all the rest of his complaints in whichever Shape they appear". 30 The eye was very bloodshot and inflamed; the eyelid was swollen so he could hardly open it. The other eye was dull and "he had very little sight of it".31 By 14 June the eye problem had eased somewhat but Lady Malton could find no cause to attribute the improvement to any of the "cures". Charles was still being subjected to Bristol water, Beazor mineral, Viper broth, cinnabar and the precipitate per se.32 She decided to take the <span class="blue">boy</span> home to Wentworth because he was <br><br> 26 WWM, M7-38.

The flesh he lost in the Accidental Feavour he has not Recover'd and his complexion is of the most sickly sort his hands of the same Hue his legs are tollerable [sic] well".34 <br><br> They returned to Wentworth in short stages and by 6 September Higham was "perfectly recovered . . . after the long and successful Care that Lady Malton has taken" of him.35 In May 1743 he was inoculated against <span class="yellow">smallpox</span> and made a perfect recovery after which he caught cold "by stripping when He was hot".36 Lord Higham does not seem to have been seriously ill after that until, at the age of 19, he undertook his Grand Tour in 1749. <br><br> In July 1750, by then Lord Malton, he had cause to consult Nicolo Scanagati in Padua for the treatment of gonorrhoea. Scanagati produced a lengthy medical report of Malton's treatment, presumably for his English doctor's enlightenment.37 The initial treatment was an "electuary, consisting of three ounces of emollient, three drams of powdered <span class="yellow">jalap</span>, a half [dram] of purified nitre, bound together with <span class="yellow">lemon</span> juice taken twice a day". The result was satisfactory: "The dark greenish poison was oozing slowly from his penis, which was all contracted and the sharp and constant pain extended from the perineum up to the urinary bladder, producing small swellings now in this place, now in that." There was a fierce burning sensation in the glands, which prevented him from sleeping. Because of this, it seemed reasonable to bathe that part in tepid water and milk, and to apply poultices to the areas affected by swelling and contractions, together with cold drinks and a few grains of laudanum at night. <br><br> Malton was blooded regularly besides being given purgatives; the treatment then moved on to the administration of mercury, both internal and on the gums, since it was widely believed at the time that gonorrhoea and syphilis were steps of the same disease, "the Venereal". Scanagati at this point ruled out the suggestion of syphilitic chancre because Malton's urine was fine and light with a pungent odour. Scanagati did ask if Malton had previously ever had a similar peculiarity of his urine. Malton replied that when he was very young and still inexperienced sexually, for some time following a fever he had had the same unusual urine, and indeed that on one occasion this symptom coincided with certain tumours on the testicles. It was only by chance that he had not had recourse to surgery, the reason being that he was also afflicted with a throat infection-to which he was prone-and therefore had his vein opened four times. Thereupon the inflammation subsided, and equally the tumours and sediment disappeared. <br><br> He told me that as a youth he had sometimes experienced some difficulty and a burning sensation when urinating, which subsided when his blood was let and with the application of poultices. I observed that from time to time his face and body were covered with purplish spots, which, having produced a little fluid, would disappearas indeed happened in the course of the cure, at the end of which his face was entirely <br><br> 33 WWM, M7-47.

From this observation, it seemed to me simple to deduce both the original cause and the more immediate cause of the said sediment: namely a natural complexion of humours which are exacerbated by muriatic [i.e., acidic] sourness, together with the marked inflammation of the blood and the motion of the contracted poison. <br><br> Scanagati then recommended the continuation of the electuary made of emollient, guaiacum resin, balsam, <span class="yellow">rhubarb</span>, and nitre. <br><br> What does all this add up to in terms of diagnosis? The early illness is a mystery. Did he have an inguinal hernia; or perhaps mumps or epididymitis? His was a childless marriage. He seems to have been too fit for the illness to have been rheumatic fever. Cystitis was not uncommon and this could certainly lead to "strangury". Perhaps Rockingham suffered from a congenital defect of his urinogenitary system which would result in recurrent attacks of cystitis and might cause long-term damage to the urinary tract and eventual destruction of the kidneys, precipitating sudden and unexpected death. <br><br> Another possibility might be diabetes. Rockingham had a urinary infection and certainly suffered from recurrent skin infections, although it appears from Scanagati's report that these cleared up when mercury was administered. <br><br> Certainly the marquis complained often about pains in his side and stomach and made no secret of his "old complaint". He was noticeably less physically active as he moved into his thirties and only occasionally exerted himself by riding any distance, even though he had enjoyed hunting when he was younger. He found the pains caused by his "old complaint" made him feel so ill that he was unable to concentrate on "any Manner of Business" and on occasion it seemed likely to prevent him from attending Parliament.38 He may well have suffered from a problem with gallstones from an early age.39 He appears to have suffered from a nervous disorder which manifested itself in severe palpitations, trembling, and other types of physical discomforts such as boils and headaches with which he was frequently afflicted.40 He probably had constipation too, since he was always dosing himself with purgatives. In fact in April 1772 the Duke of Richmond decided that Rockingham's real problem was a "surfeit of physick"41 although Edmund Burke noted in June 1772 that the marquis had had a long and severe illness.42 Whatever his many and varied ailments, Rockingham survived until he was 52 in spite of the attentions of both doctors and quacks and that, for the mid-eighteenth century, was a good age. The mystery still remains, however. Contemporary opinion had it that he died of pneumonia but it must have struck <br><br> 38 WWM, R153-1. Rockingham to Burke, 31 October 1767; WWM, RI-1238.

Abstract

 SUGGESTIONS CONCERNING THE USE OF THE SUBCLAVIAN <br><br> WHICH ARISES FROM THE AORTA IN THE TREATMENT <br><br> OF THE TETRALOGY OF FALLOT* <br><br> HARRIS B. SHUMACKER, JR.** <br><br> In Blalock's early experience with the operative treatment of the tetralogy of Fallot, the two subclavian, the innominate, and carotid arteries were all used for anastomosis to the pulmonary artery. Soon, however, it became evident that use of the innominate or carotid was followed by a relatively high incidence of complications resulting from cerebral ischemia. Blalock suggested, therefore, that the subclavian be used by preference. The subclavian branch of the innominate does not become kinked or badly angulated when it is turned down for the anastomosis, and a good functional result almost invariably follows the completion of a satisfactory anastomosis. The subclavian which arises directly from the aorta, on the other hand, tends to form a bad angle when it is brought down for the anastomosis, and, indeed, near its point of origin it may be so flattened out against the relatively rigid aortic wall as to obstruct all blood flow through it. These considerations led Blalock to recommend the use of the former except in <span class="yellow">infants</span> under two years of age in whom this artery may be too small and in adults or <span class="yellow">children</span> over twelve years old or five feet tall with a left aortic arch in whom it is often too short to permit a satisfactory anastomosis.7' <br><br> In contrast, Paine and Varco,' Lam,6 Holman,' Olim,7 and others have preferred to use the subclavian which arises from the aorta and have obtained generally excellent results. They point out that the tendency to kinking of the artery is more a theoretical than a practical disadvantage, that the exposure and dissection of both the pulmonary artery and the subclavian are easier on the side of the aortic arch, that both vessels are generally longer than on the opposite side and that, as a general rule, the anastomosis can be accomplished more readily. The practical usefulness of a third systemic vessel, namely the aorta, was demonstrated by the development of a technique for side-to-side aortic pulmonary anastomosis by Potts and his associates."0 In spite of the preferences held by individual operators for use of one vessel or another, the fact remains, as Blalock has emphasized, that there is always present a usable systemic vessel provided a suitable pulmonary artery is available. Nevertheless, the choice of the systemic artery in each individual <span class="yellow">patient</span> is important since in certain cases one or another is unsuitable. <br><br> * From the Department of Surgery, the Indiana University Medical Center, Indianapolis, Indiana.

Received for publication April 26, 1951. <br><br> TREATMENT OF TETRALOGY OF FALLOT <br><br> It has been my custom to follow a policy rather similar to that outlined by Blalock. The subclavian branch of the innominate has generally been preferred in <span class="yellow">patients</span> ranging between two and twelve years of age and in older individuals in whom there is a right aortic arch. In others the thoracotomy is usually made on the side of the aortic arch, and either the aorta itself or the subclavian arising from the aorta is used for the anastomosis. My experience with the use of the subclavian originating from the aorta is small and the results have not been as good as those which others have reported. One eighteen-month-old <span class="yellow">child</span> died the day after operation and was found at post-mortem examination to have an occluded anastomosis. In one three-year-old <span class="yellow">child</span> and one twenty-year-old <span class="yellow">woman</span> a poor result was obtained and a second operation upon the other side was necessary. In two additional cases the result was only fair. Excluding the <span class="yellow">patients</span> mentioned in the present report, only in two was an unquestionably good result obtained. <br><br> Recently, in several cases in which failure seemed evident a modification has been required in order to obtain a functioning shunt. Since these modifications proved successful and since these threats of failure tax one's ingenuiity at the time of operation, I have thought it might be helpful to describe the procedures employed and to illustrate them with case reports. One is a method which obviously has very limited applicability, while the otlher would seem to be rather generally applicable. <br><br> The first consists of the transplantation of the origin of the subclavian to a more suitable portion of the aorta. <br><br> Case report <br><br> The <span class="yellow">patient</span> was a 19-year-old <span class="yellow">girl</span> who had been cyanotic since the age of six months. She had developed normally but was always limited in exercise capacity. In her early years of school she was taken to school by her parents and carried to and from her seat in the classroom. She did reasonably well in high school, being driven to and from the school, but she got into severe difficulty when she attempted to attend college. The longer distances between classes and the necessity for climbing stairs precipitated a downhill course, with increasing dyspnea, more marked cyanosis and fatigue, and the onset of bouts of loss of consciousness. The latter occurred several times daily. One which was witnessed by her physician lasted 45 minutes; he feared it would prove fatal. Ordinarily, she could not walk more than half a block. <br><br> There was marked cyanosis of the nails and mucous membranes and to a lesser extent of the skin. Clubbing was very prominent. All the results of physical and laboratory examination fitted in with a diagnosis of tetralogy of Fallot. The hematocrit ranged between 83 and 90. Oxygen saturation of arterial blood was 65 per cent at complete rest. The aortic arch was on the left side. On October 26, 1949 a left lateral thoracotomy was performed, the pleural cavity being entered through the bed of the fifth rib. There was evident greatly increased collateral circulation in the mediastinum and hilum. The pulmonary artery appeared to have markedly reduced blood flow, was very short, small, and thin-walled. Its diameter was less than 5 mm. The aorta seemed to be bowed out laterally in an unusual fashion and the short pulmonary artery could not possibly be brought out over it. The subclavian artery was relatively small, having <br><br> 487 <br><br> YALE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE <br><br> a diameter of only about 4 mm. but it seemed rather long. It was apparent that a Pott's procedure was impossible and that an end-to-side subclavian pulmonary artery anastomosis would be doomed to failure. Hence, the subclavian artery was divided at the level of its first branch, the pulmonary artery was divided proximally, and an end-to-end subclavian-pulmonary anastomosis was carried out. This was done with ease. When the clamps were removed, however, no blood flowed through it. The softwalled subclavian was completely flattened out against the relatively rigid aorta (Fig. 1). When the hilar structures were forcibly elevated in a cephalad direction the subclavian immediately filled and pulsated normally and a thrill could be felt. Simple expansion of the lungs, however, failed to achieve this result and I could conceive of no way in which the hilar region could be held in a more cephalad direction. The subclavian was then ligated at the point where it came off the aorta and its proximal end was anastomosed end-to-side to the descending aorta. It now pulsated vigorously as did the pulmonary artery. In spite of the good pulsation no thrill was palpable. The <span class="yellow">patient</span> had an uneventful but disappointing convalescence. She remained markedly cyanotic and no continuous bruit was audible. When she left the hospital 14 days after operation there was no improvement in her appearance, hematocrit, or arterial oxygen saturation. <br><br> Surprisingly enough she reported progress on each follow-up examination. By the end of seven weeks she was obviously less cyanotic, her hematocrit was 77, and she was able to walk a number of blocks and to climb a flight of stairs without difficulty. She reported that she had danced and roller-skated without much trouble. Shortly thereafter a continuous murmur was audible in the left chest. She continued to improve and in January entered a southern college. She did well. At least once a day, often twice, she walked without difficulty from the campus into town and back, a distance of ten blocks each way. She played a little tennis, learned to swim, and began to dance, including jitterbugging. When she xvas seen in June, her color was good, although there was still slight cyanosis of lips and nail beds. There was a very loud, continuous murmur in the left chest. The following fall she transferred to a midwestern university. She got along reasonably well but not as well as she had in a warmer climate and on more level terrain. She walked four or five blocks up and down hills between classes without difficulty in good weather but complained of some dyspnea and fatigue on cold, windy days. She attended dances and often danced each number throughout the evening without trouble. When seen in December she looked well. Her color was good and clubbing was definitely less marked than it had been previously. She had a severe cold at the time. Her oxygen saturation of arterial blood was 75 per cent at rest and it did not fall when she stood or still-walked. The hematocrit was 69. There was audible the same loud continuous murmur in the left chest. <br><br> Though the <span class="yellow">patient</span> has been markedly improved, it is recognized that the result is not as good as is commonly obtained when <span class="yellow">patients</span> with more adequate pulmonary arteries are treated by the conventional anastomosis of a systemic artery to the side of the pulmonary artery. Nevertheless, the <span class="yellow">patient</span> has thus far been given such good health and relatively normal capacity for ordinary activity that further operation has seemed unwarranted, though the possibility of some future attempt at creation of an additional shunt is being kept in mind. <br><br> The second procedure embodies the cephalad transplantation of the pulmonary artery by a plastic repair of the incision in the hilar and mediastinal pleural structures. <br><br> 488 <br><br> FIG. 1.

He was admitted to the hospital on July 18, 1950 and was operated upon two days later. He was known to have a left aortic arch, and a left lateral thoracotomy was performed. The aorta was freed for a side-to-side anastomosis with the pulmonary artery. So much difficulty was encountered, however, in placing the aortic clamp in proper position for making a satisfactory incision in the aorta that the procedure was abandoned and an end-to-side subclavian-pulmonary artery anastomosis accomplished instead. The pulmonary artery was of fair size, having an estimated diameter of 1 cm. The subclavian artery appeared to be quite long and it was of very satisfactory size, having a diameter of about 6 mm. To my dismay, the first portion of the soft-walled subclavian artery was completely flattened out against the rather rigid wall of the aorta and no blood flow through it could be demonstrated, there being no subclavian pulsation nor thrill in the pulmonary artery. If one forcefully elevated the hilum of the lung in a cephalad direction, the obstruction disappeared, the subclavian artery began to pulsate, and a thrill could be palpated. When the lung was allowed to assume its usual position, the subclavian obstruction was again evident and could not be prevented by full expansion of the lung. It was found that the hilar region and the pulmonary artery could be maintained in a satisfactory cephalad position by traction upward upon the cuff of hilar pleura and the adjacent vascular sheath and that these structures were sufficiently strong so that traction could be maintained upon them with a small hemostat. The defect in the mediastinal and hilar tissues was then repaired using a sort of inverted T-plastic closure. By this maneuver success was achieved in elevating the pulmonary artery in a cephalad direction so that the subclavian obstruction was relieved and excellent pulsation was evident (Fig. 2B). A fairly good continuous thrill was palpable. The <span class="yellow">patient</span> had an uneventful convalescence. When last seen on January 16, 1951 he had excellent color without any visible cyanosis. The clubbing seemed to have decreased somewhat. A continuous murmur was audible. He stated that he noted no limitation of exercise capacity. In outlining his activities he said that, among other things, he was doing a great deal of ice-skating and was playing ice hockey regularly. He was planning to start college work the following month. <br><br> The second <span class="yellow">patient</span> was a 16-year-old <span class="blue">boy</span> who had been cyanotic since birth. His physical development was somewhat retarded and he was slow in learning to sit and walk. Until he had grown old enough to be self-conscious about it he had always squatted when he was tired. By perseverance he had managed to do more than one would have suspected he could from the degree of his cyanosis. He could walk as much as five or six blocks at a slow pace. He was fond of drums and managed to play occasionally with an orchestra in a somewhat restricted fashion. For the past few months he had had more dyspnea, fatigability, and seemed to be going downhill generally. <br><br> The results of physical and laboratory studies were rather typical of the tetralogy of Fallot. Clubbing was marked, the nailbeds and mucous membranes were a rather deep purplish-blue color, and the skin had a dusky cyanotic tint. The aortic arch was determined to be on the left. On July 21, 1950 a left lateral thoracotomy was performed, the pleural cavity being entered through the bed of the fourth rib. There was a rather marked increase in the collateral circulation in the mediastinum and the hilar region. The pulmonary artery was easily dissected free. It was fairly long and was about 1 cm. in diameter. The subclavian artery seemed quite long and was of adequate size, having a diameter of about 5 mm. An end-to-side sub9lavian pulmonary anastomosis was performed. Again in this case, however, the first part of the subclavian was acutely angulated and completely flattened out against the aortic wall. There was no <br><br> 489 <br><br> YALE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE <br><br> pulsation in the subclavian and no thrill in the pulmonary. In this instance also, good blood flow through the subclavian artery was evident whenever the hilar structures were elevated in a cephalad direction but no pulsation was demonstrable simply by expanding fully the lung. Again, a sort of inverted T-plastic closure of the defect in the hilum and mediastinum brought about a cephalad elevation of the pulmonary artery so that tension was released and there was excellent pulsation in the subclavian artery. A thrill was now palpable. Convalescence was uneventful. Improvement in color was evident within a few days and his color was excellent by the time he was discharged from the hospital on the thirteenth postoperative day. He rapidly found that he was now able to lead a quite normal sort of life. When he was seen on December 9 he stated that he had no limitation in exercise capacity. He could walk rapidly without fatigue. He was going to school and was playing the drums in a professional orchestra three or four nights each week. There was some diminution in the clubbing and his color was excellent. There was a loud continuous bruit audible in the chest. On March 27 the arterial oxygen saturation was 88.2 per cent. <br><br> When I first used this procedure I was rather surprised that such tissues would hold sutures and serve satisfactorily to elevate the hilum. On occasions I had previously toyed with the idea of suturing hilar pleura to the mediastinal pleura but had abandoned it as impractical because the sutures seemed to pull out whenever there was any tension whatsoever. If the procedure is to be successful, it is essential that the sutures encompass any adjacent areolar and fibrous tissue and especially the so-called vascular sheath which surrounds both pulmonary artery and aorta and is dissected free during the course of the operation. Fortunately, in its proximal portion the sheath about the pulmonary artery gains added strength from the extension into it of a reflection of the fibrous pericardium. Sutures through the mediastinal pleura in the region of the aortic arch purposely include the perivascular tissues which have been stripped off the aorta and subclavian artery and also any other available tissue which may lend strength, such as the divided ends of the supreme intercostal vein or other vessels which lhave been transected and ligated. The exact method of repair will vary from case to case. By placing the sutures properly it would seem possible sometimes to displace the pulmonary artery laterally as well as in a cephalad direction if such a maneuver was thought to be desirable (Fig. 2C). On occasions one would close the pleural defect fairly snugly, on others leave it wide open in places. <br><br> Discussion <br><br> Though there is always available some suitable systemic vessel and though the major concern in the operative treatment of the tetralogy of Fallot is the adequacy of the pulmonary artery, from time to time one may find the achievement of a satisfactory result thwarted by the local anatomical characteristics regardless of one's choice of procedure. Consequently, those modifications which may add to the likelihood of a successful outcome are important. Blalock"' pointed out the practicability of performing an end-toend subclavian-pulmonary artery anastomosis whenever the pulmonary artery is judged too small or the subclavian too short for a satisfactory end<br><br> 490 <br><br> TREATMENT OF TETRALOGY OF FALLOT             491 <br><br> to-side anastomosis. Holman' feels that a poorly functioning shunt after end-to-side anastomosis can usually be corrected by proximal division of the subclavian artery, thus in effect converting the procedure into an end-to-end anastomosis. If a satisfactory end-to-side suture of subclavian and pulmonary arteries or side-to-side aortic pulmonary anastomosis seems difficult to achieve, one may occasionally find it useful to divide the upper lobe branch of the pulmonary artery and carry out an end-to-end suture of the subclavian and the proximal end of the upper lobe branch. Potts and Smith' performed an anastomosis between the proximal end of the upper lobe branch and the side of the aorta in a case in which complete temporary occlusion of the main pulmonary artery was withstood poorly. I have found this principle of division of the upper lobe branch and use of its proximal end of value in obtaining a suitable subclavian pulmonary anastomosis when the subclavian seemed to have inadequate length. On occasions when the systemic vessel seems too short, one may elect to interpose a free vascular transplant,3"' a modification I first employed in 1946 though unfortunately not with success in this instance. <br><br> The operation performed in my first <span class="yellow">patient</span> constitutes in reality the use of the subclavian artery as an autogenous graft between the aorta and pulmonary artery. It will obviously not often be the procedure of choice but sometimes may be found a useful measure in converting an apparently inadequate functional shunt into a good one. If my initial experiences with the plastic repair of the defect in the mediastinal and hilar structures are characteristic of what may be expected of this procedure, it would seem to have wide applicability whenever a poorly functioning subclavian-pulmonary shunt seems correctable by cephalad transplantation of the hilar structures and the consequent release of tension. I was unaware of any reference in the literature to its use until belatedly I discovered that I had overlooked a statement in the legend of one of the excellent drawings in Blalock's paper on surgical procedures in pulmonic stenosis.' Here he states that suture of the pleura of the superior aspect of the hilum to the mediastinal pleura may effectively elevate a little the pulmonary artery. Perhaps our more detailed consideration of this maneuver may add to its general usefulness. <br><br> REFERENCES <br><br> 1 Blalock, A.: The technique of creation of an artificial ductus arteriosus in the <br><br> treatment of pulmonic stenosis.
