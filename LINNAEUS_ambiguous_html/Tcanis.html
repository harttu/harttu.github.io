Abstract
This study was undertaken to evaluate the role of IL-5 in eosinophil migration and in the maintenance of eosinophilia in a <span class="yellow">guinea-pig</span> model of visceral larva migrans syndrome. The results show that the infection of animals with <span class="yellow">Toxocara canis</span> induced an early increase in serum IL-5 levels that might be essential for eosinophil differentiation and proliferation and for the development of eosinophilia. When infected <span class="yellow">guinea-pigs</span> were treated with mAb anti-IL-5 (TRFK-5) given at the same time or 1 or 3 days after infection, there was a high percentage of reduction of eosinophil counts 18 days after infection. However, when the mAb was administered during the peak of eosinophilia, there was high inhibition in blood, no inhibition in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) or peritoneum and an increase in eosinophil numbers in bone marrow. Thus, a basic level of IL-5 may be essential to drive eosinophils from bone marrow to blood and tissues, and for the maintenance of eosinophilia in infected animals. We may also conclude that when eosinophils have already migrated to the lungs, TRFK-5 has no power to inhibit eosinophilia, which is also under control of local lung cells producing IL-5. In this way, only one later TRFK-5 treatment may not be sufficient to modify the lung parenchyma microenvironment, since <span class="blue">T. canis</span> antigens had already stimulated some cell populations to produce IL-5.

In <span class="yellow">humans</span>, VLMS results from the ingestion of embryonated eggs of <span class="blue">T. canis</span>, that eclode in the small intesfine. The infective larvae invade the mucosa, move into the liver via the portal circulation, and from there to the lungs. 2 Beaver et al., 3 who were the first to describe this syndrome, noted the intense eosinophilia which reaches more than 90% of total leucocyte counts. However, there are few studies regarding the mechanisms involved in the blood and tissue eosinophilia obseeeed in VLMS. Several investigators have suggested a direct correlation between eosinophilia and interleukin5 (IL-5) in <span class="yellow">human</span> helminth infections4'5 and in experimental animal models. 67 Inhibition of eosinophilia has been demonstrated by anti-IL-5 24 Mediators of Inflammation Vol 5 <br><br> brasiliensis, 8 $chistosoma mansoni, <span class="yellow">Toxocara canis</span>7 and <span class="yellow">Heligmosomoidespolygyrus</span>. 1 IL-5 has also been shown to support the terminal differentiation, proliferation of eosinophil precursors 11'12 and eosinophil activation. 13 Although IL-5 does not demonstrate eosinophil chemotactic activity in vivo14 there is some evidence suggesting that this cytokine may modulate a selective eosinophil accumulation at the site of inflammation. Moreover, Sehmi et a/.15 reported that IL-5 has a selective priming effect on eosinophil migratory response to nonselective chemoattractant mediators in vitro. Also, Moser et a/. 16 have demonstrated that in order to acquire the ability to transmigrate, eosinophils must be primed with IL-5, IL-3 and GM-CSF. Thus, the involvement of IL-5 in eosinophilia is not fully understood. In the present study we have used a <span class="yellow">guinea-pig</span> model of VLMS to investigate the involvement of IL-5 in eosinophil migration and in the maintenance of eosinophilia in blood, bone marrow, lung and peritoneal cavity.

Determination oflL-5 in serum: The IL-5 level in the serum of <span class="yellow">guinea-pigs</span> was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Briefly, ELISA plates (96-well Immunoplate MaxiSorp, Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with IL-5-specific monoclonal antibody (TRFK-5, 5 lag/ml in phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4, PBS, 100 l.tl/well). After 2 h of incubation at 37C, the wells were washed four times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T). Then, 100 btl of samples or recombinant <span class="yellow">murine</span> IL-5 standards (0.15-200ng/ml) in PBS-T and 2% BSA (PBSTBSA) were added to each well. After incubation for l h at 37C, the wells were washed three times and 100 l.tl of biotinylated <span class="yellow">rat</span> anti-<span class="yellow">murine</span> IL-5 (biotinylated-TRFK-5, 1 lag/ml in PBS-TBSA) was added. After incubation for 1 h at 37C, the wells were washed again three times and 100 of peroxidase-labelled streptavidin (1/1000, Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories Inc., Maryland, USA) were added to each well. Following incubation for l h at 37C and further washing, the enzyme was developed using the TMB substrate peroxidase for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 501.tl of 2.0 N HCl, and the optical densities were read at 490nm using an automated plate reader. The sensitivity of the assay was 0.15 ng/ml and the upper limit 100ng/ml. <br><br> the animal house of Ribeiro Preto, Uni<br><br> Infection of animals: <span class="blue">T. canis</span> eggs were obtained by the methods of Olson and Schulz, 17 with minor modifications. Briefly, gravid female <span class="yellow">worms</span> were recovered from <span class="yellow">dogs</span>, and the eggs were rescued from the uterus, washed and allowed to develop to the infective stage in shallow dishes containing 0.5% formalin at 37C. Under light ether anaesthesia, the animals were infected with I ml saline containing 500 <span class="blue">T. canis</span> eggs, by gastric intubation using a metal cannula. Blood cell counts: <span class="yellow">Guinea-pigs</span> were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone (30mg/kg, i.v.) and blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture with 10% EDTA. Total cell counts were carried out using diluting fluid in a Neubauer chamber.

The <span class="yellow">guinea-pigs</span> were killed by an overdose of sodium pentobarbitone and 5ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% sodium citrate (PBS/SC), at room temperature, were instilled through a polyethylene cannula introduced into the trachea. The cells present in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were recovered immediately. The procedure was repeated once. The leucocyte counts in the BAI_ were determined as described above, Peritoneal cells: The cells from the peritoneal cavities were harvested by injection of 10ml of PBS/SC into the peritoneum.

Data obtained from five animals. <br><br> drastically reduced, even when determined 18 days after infection (Table 1). No inhibition of eosinophil counts was observed when the animals were inoculated with the irrelevant antibody at the time of infection (Table 1). Fig. 4 shows the comparative results of eosinophilia obtained when the antibody was given 3 days or 17 days after egg inoculation. The antibody given at 3 days after infection induced a high percentage of inhibition in eosinophil counts in all the compartments analysed 18 days after infection (Fig. 4A). However, when TRFK-5 was administered to the infected animals on day 17 post-infection (thus 1 day before sacrifice), a significant inhibition in number and percentage of eosinophils was observed only in the blood (p=0.030) (Fig. 4B). A small non-significant decrease was seen in BALF (p 0.790) and peritoneum (p= 0.222). Moreover, the number of mature eosinophils in bone marrow increased by 140% (p 0.038). As demonstrated in Fig. 4B, the behaviour of eosinotShilia in BALF was completely different from that observed in blood. Thus, to better understand the eosinophilia in the lungs of infected animals, we monitored eosinophil numbers in BALF after administration of TRFK-5 at the same time, or 1, 3, 12 or 17 days after infection. The animals were sacrificed 18 days after infection. In another group, TRFK-5 was administered 18 days post-infection and the animals were sacrificed 6 days later. When the mAb was administered at the same time or 1 or 3 days postinfection there was a significant inhibition in the number of eosinophils (Fig. 5).

However, the treatment of animals with TRFK-5 at the same time of infection, or 1 day or 3 days later ted to a complete inhibition of eosinophil infiltration in the lung parenchyma (Fig. 6C). By contrast, the mononuclear cell infiltration in the lungs was not modified. When the infected <span class="yellow">guinea-pigs</span> received TRFK-5 1 day before sacrifice (or 17 days post-infection), eosinophil infiltration in the lung parenchyma was also inhibited (Fig. 6D) but not to the same extent as observed in the group receiving TRFK-5 given at the time of infection or 3 days later. Thus, the histological determination of eosinophil infiltration in these lungs corroborates a reduction but not a sizeable inhibition of eosinophil numbers as observed in the BALF of the same infected animals, <br><br> poorly defined, although T lymphocytes and mast cells appear to be involved in eosinophilia. 9'2 IL-5, a T cell-derived factor that regulates B cell functions, is an eosinophil differentiation factor11 as well as a stimulating and survival-prolonging factor specific for eosinophils in vitro. 2 Also, several investigators have demonstrated that sTstemic eosinophilia in <span class="yellow">mice</span> infected with parasites is mediated by IL-5 produced in response to the infection. 2'22 In the present study, the i.p. administration of the TRFK-5 antibody markedly inhibited the widespread eosinophilia observed in <span class="blue">T. canis</span>-infected <span class="yellow">guinea-pigs</span>, indicating that IL5 participated in a <span class="yellow">guinea-pig</span> model of VLMS eosinophJlia. Most of the <span class="blue">T. canis</span> larvae which penetrated the intestinal wall had migrated into the liver within 72h after inoculation as demonstrated here and elsewhere. 2 It is apparently during this interval that the worm provides the signals to cytokine-producing cells, which in turn trigger increased serum levels of specific cytokine as demonstrated here for IL-5, 24 to 72 h after infection. The signals may be provided directly by the invading parasite or by cells in response to the parasite. The cytokine pattern that develops at this early stage, probably induced by a T-cell independent pathway, may also influence the pattern of T cell differentiation into a Th2 type, which may be responsible for the second peak of IL-5 observed in our experimental model (Fig. 3), although a second cycle of larval invasion (Fig. 2) with a rapid peak of IL-5 liberation cannot be ruled out. <br><br> Discussion The results of the present study show that in our experimental model widespread eosinophilia follows the infection of <span class="yellow">guinea-pigs</span> with second stage eggs from <span class="blue">T. canis</span>, as also noted in <span class="yellow">humans</span> and in other experimental animals. 7'7 <span class="blue">T. canis</span> is a potent stimulus for systemic eosinophilia, since blood, BALF, peritoneum and all tissues examined (kidney, eyes, spleen, thymus, <br><br> Thus, our results suggest that the eosinophilia against helminth larvae may be initiated by the release of IL-5 when the parasites migrate from the intestine to the liver by stimulation of specific cell populations. Then, an early release of IL-5 quickly induces eosinophil recruitment, probably first from the stored mature eosinophil pool from vascular endothelium or by the mobilization of eosinophils from extravascular sites to the blood. This fact could explain why we found increased eosinophils first in blood and later in other compartments. The early IL-5 release may also serve as a signal for eosinophil differentiation and maturation in bone marrow. The time <br><br> inteeeal observed between the first peak of IL-5 release and the increase of eosinophils in blood coincides with that reported to be necessary for eosinophil differentiation and maturation in vitro. 12Increased eosinophil production and liberation into blood and other tissues occurs Mediators of Inflammation Vol 5 <br><br> 1996 <br><br> 29 <br><br> L. H. Faccioli et al. <br><br> FIG. 6. (A) photomicrographs of lung parenchyma from <span class="yellow">guinea-pigs</span> infected for 18 days with <span class="yellow">T. cani</span>,, (B) infected animals which were treated with irrelevant antibody at the time of infection; (C) infected animals which were treated with the mAb TRFK-5 at 3 days after infection; (D) mAb administration 17 days after infection. The animals were sacrificed 18 days after infection. Note the intense eosinophil infiltration into the lung in A and B, the inhibition of eosinophils in C and the reduction of eosinophils in D. <br><br> thereafter. Thus, early and later IL-5 release provides a necessary level of this cytokine, which is involved in the maintenance of eosinophilia. We may assume that the inhibition of the first peak of IL-5 release by TRFK-5 does not permit the subsequent T cell stimulation and differentiation. This may explain the long-lasting effect of TRFK5 treatment observed here and also reported by others. 8 In agreement with our results, there is an important observation of Svetic et al. 24 showing that a specific and highly reproducible IL-5 gene expression pattern is detectable in Peyer's patches by 6 to 12h after <span class="yellow">Heligmosomoides polygyrus</span> infection. The early increase in IL-5 gene expression after infection was probably T cell-independent, inasmuch as it was obseeeed in Peyer's patches of congenitally athymic <span class="yellow">mice</span> and of conventional <span class="yellow">mice</span> treated with anti-CD4 30 Mediators of Inflammation Vol 5 <br><br> and anti-CD8 mAb. Moreover, Kusama eta/. 25 have observed two peaks of eosinophilia in normal and athymic <span class="yellow">mice</span>, and suggested that IL-5 observed in the first peak was produced by cells other than CD4 T cells, since anti-CD4 and anti-CD3 mAb reduced only the second peak of eosinophilia in normal <span class="yellow">mice</span> and slightly reduced the first peak of eosinophilia in both normal and nu/nu <span class="yellow">mice</span>. The local lung cells producing IL-5 may also help us to explain the reason why 12, 17 or 18 days post-infection TRFK-5 treatment only partially inhibits, or does not inhibit eosinophil infiltration into the lungs, as demonstrated in Figs 5 and 6. We may suggest that when eosinophils have already migrated to the lungs, TRFK-5 has no power to inhibit eosinophilia, which is also under control of local lung cells producing IL-5. In this way, only one later TRFK<br><br> 1996 <br><br> IL-5 drives eosinophils in <span class="yellow">guinea-pig</span> <br><br> 5 treatment may not be sufficient to modify the lung parenchyma microenvironment, since <span class="blue">T. canis</span> antigens have already stimulated some cell populations to produce IL-5, as demonstrated by Kusama et aL25These results suggest that eosinophilia in lungs is under the control of different factors when compared to that observed in blood and the peritoneal cavity. One of the most important results obtained here was the inhibition of circulating eosinophil numbers by the different mAb treatments, even when the antibody was given at the peak of blood eosinophilia, which was accompanied by an increase of mature eosinophils in bone marrow. This suggests that IL-5, apart from being required for the terminal differentiation of eosinophils in bone marrow, 26 is also likely to drive eosinophils from the bone marrow to the blood and then to the tissues, probably by upregulating VLA-4 expression in eosinophils. Moser et aL have demonstrated that in order to acquire the ability to transmigrate, eosinophils must be primed with cytokines such as IL-5, IL-3 or GM-CSF for expression of adhesion molecules such as VI-4. Recently, Pretolani et al. 27 have indeed shown that an anti-VLA-4 antibody suppresses eosinophil recruitment to lung in the <span class="yellow">guinea-pig</span> and, as a consequence, inhibits the accompanying bronchopulmonary hyperresponsiveness. <br><br> tant in protective immunity to a gastrointestinal nematode infection in <span class="yellow">mice</span>.
