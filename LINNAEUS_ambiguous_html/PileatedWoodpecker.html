Abstract
Background
The apparent rediscovery of the <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> <span class="yellow">Campephilus principalis</span> in Arkansas, USA, previously feared extinct, was supported by video evidence of a single bird in flight (Fitzpatrick et al, Science 2005, 308:1460–1462). Plumage patterns and wingbeat frequency of the putative <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> were said to be incompatible with the only possible confusion species native to the area, the <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span> <span class="yellow">Dryocopus pileatus</span>.<br><br>Results
New video analysis of <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> in escape flights comparable to that of the putative <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> filmed in Arkansas shows that <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> can display a wingbeat frequency equivalent to that of the Arkansas bird during escape flight. The critical frames from the Arkansas video that were used to identify the bird as an <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> are shown to be equally, or more, compatible with the <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span>.<br><br>Conclusion
The identification of the bird filmed in Arkansas in April 2004 as an <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> is best regarded as unsafe. The similarities between the Arkansas bird and known <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> suggest that it was most likely a <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span>.<br><br><br><br>Background
The reported rediscovery of the <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> in 2004–5 in the Big Woods of Arkansas gave new impetus to efforts to conserve the mature bottomland woodlands of the south-eastern USA. Several sightings have been reported without photographic evidence being obtained [1]. Unless sightings are, however, independently verifiable on the basis of photographic or other recorded evidence, the possibility that mistakes have been made cannot be eliminated. Crucial to the scientific case for the persistence of the <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> was a 4 s video of a large woodpecker in flight recorded by M.D. Luneau on 25 April 2004 (henceforth referred to as the 'Luneau video') and published in 2005 [1], which was claimed to be inconsistent with the plumage patterns of the superficially similar <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span> (a common resident bird of the area). Both species are large, black-and-white woodpeckers [2]. The upperwing of the <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> is black, with white secondary feathers and white on some inner primary feathers. <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> have a largely black upperwing, with white restricted to the 'wrist' due to white bases to the primary feathers. The underwing of <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span> has all-white underwing coverts, giving an appearance of a white underwing with a broad black outline (the black flight feathers). These plumage differences result in the <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> having a white trailing edge to the wings (upper and lower sides), whereas the <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span> has a black trailing edge to the wings. Both species have black wing-tips. These and other plumage characteristics are shown in [1,2]. The wingbeat frequency of the bird in the Luneau video was measured at 8.6 beats s-1, similar to that inferred from archival sound recording of a single <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span>, but claimed to be outside the range of <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> (which generally have slower wingbeats) [1,3].
Sibley et al [4] questioned the video evidence, in particular providing alternative explanations for the plumage patterns of the Luneau bird in flight and at rest. They pointed out individual frames of the Luneau video that appear to show three features that are each inconsistent with <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span>: (1) apparently black secondary feathers on the upper surface of the left wing, (2) particularly bright white primary bases, and (3) a black band curving smoothly round the wing tip (see Figure 3 in [4]). They hypothesized that flexing of a <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span>'s wings during flight could produce the appearance of white trailing edges on both wings in low-quality videos [4]. They offered, however, no direct evidence to show that this could cause a video of a <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span> to look like the bird in the Luneau video. Fitzpatrick et al [5] in turn rebutted some aspects of the hypothesis of Sibley et al [4], publishing video stills of <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span>, and a model of a <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span>, that appeared to show a black trailing edge to the wings inconsistent with <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> and the Luneau video. Fitzpatrick et al [5] neither rebutted nor discussed the three key inconsistencies described above. Without further evidence, this became largely a theoretical debate over interpretation of field characters that were barely visible in the very small images originally obtained. On one hand, as pointed out in Sibley et al [4], some of the frames of the bird in the Luneau video do appear to be inconsistent with <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span>. On the other hand, the flight pattern of the bird in the Luneau video is asserted to be atypical for <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span> (but matching anecdotal descriptions of <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span>). Furthermore, the general impression of the bird in the Luneau video was that there is far too much white in the wings for it to be a <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span>, and that if it was a <span class="yellow">Pileated</span>, then it must be an aberrant one with abnormally extensive white plumage. Such birds occasionally occur, and have been observed in the Arkansas study area [6].
This study was undertaken to determine whether the flight and plumage of the bird in the Luneau video really was inconsistent with either a normal or partial albino <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span>. Independent analyses of the plumage patterns and wingbeat frequencies observable in <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> are presented, and it is concluded that the identification of the bird in the Luneau video as definite <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> is probably unsafe.<br><br>Results
On January 28 and February 5, 2006, David Nolin (DN) video-recorded <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> <span class="yellow">Dryocopus pileatus</span> at a bird-feeder in Dayton, Ohio, USA. A Hi-8 Sony Handycam was used, hand-held, at approximately 5 m from the feeder. Birds on the tree trunk were alarmed by movement, and their escape flights recorded. Four escape flights were captured that approximate to that recorded for the putative <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> <span class="yellow">Campephilus principalis</span> by Luneau in April 2004 and published in Fitzpatrick et al [1]. The videos are not directly equivalent because the <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> made only short escape flights to nearby trees, whereas the putative <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> in the Luneau video showed little sign of coming to rest before being lost from view. Nevertheless, interesting comparisons can be made.
Wingbeat frequency of <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span>
The woodpecker in the Luneau video maintains a steady rapid wingbeat rate of 8.6 beats s-1 for at least 8 wingbeats [1], a figure that was confirmed by independent analysis during preparation of this paper. The <span class="yellow">Pileated woodpeckers</span> in DN's video do not do this – after initial rapid flapping immediately after take-off, they settle into a more relaxed level flight. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, although the mean wingbeat frequencies of the <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> in DN's video are slower than the 8.6 s-1 recorded for the bird in the Luneau video [1,3,5] the first four wingbeats, the initial escape response, are faster than those claimed for <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> in the literature [1,3,5]. For the four escape flights, the mean frequency values for the first four wingbeats are 7.1, 6.7, 8.6, and 8.0 s-1, respectively. The 8.6 beats s-1 of the bird identified in the Luneau video, while consistent with the limited data (n = 1; see Discussion) for <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span>, is equally consistent with <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span> in its initial escape flight. The bird in the Luneau video maintains a frequency of 8.6 s-1 for the next four wingbeats too, whereas the <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> recorded here all slowed their flight as they prepared to land in nearby trees. There are no data to suggest whether <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> can maintain a wingbeat frequency approaching 8.6 s-1 for eight or more wingbeats, like the bird in the Luneau video. It remains possible that the flight pattern of the bird in the Luneau video is unusual for <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span>, but a frequency of 8.6 s-1 is consistent with a <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span> gaining initial speed and height in escape flight, and by itself cannot be taken as strong evidence that the Luneau video bird was an <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span>. This is discussed further below.<br><br>Plumage pattern of <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> in flight
The video of <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> in flight was obtained in avi format, decompiled and examined frame by frame. Comparisons of <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span> images with key images of Luneau video are shown in Figures 1 and 2, and suggest a genuine resemblance between the bird in the Luneau video and a <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span>. Analysis is complicated by the different digital processing of the two videos, and in the case of the Nolin videos it is important to concentrate only on those frames or part-frames where apparent plumage features are not an artifact of blurred images. Thirty-six frames from the fourth example of <span class="yellow">Pileated</span> escape flight, which most resembled the flight path of the Luneau video bird, were analysed systematically frame by frame. They represent seven complete wingbeats (1.20 s from the middle of the second wingbeat to middle of wingbeat 9) and were directly compared frame-by-frame with the equivalent fields (middle wingbeat 2 – middle wingbeat 9) of the Luneau video. This comparison is shown in Figure 3. The images of the birds are not identical, but in every frame of the 36 frames available, there are sufficient similarities to suggest that the bird in the Luneau video is consistent with the known <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span>. Further comparisons of the Luneau bird with the other three <span class="yellow">Pileated</span> escape flights recorded are presented in the supplementary material (see Additional file 1).
Key findings of the video analysis are:
1. <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> flying near-horizontally away from the observer show much more white in poor-quality video than would be expected from their general plumage pattern. They present an appearance of a black-bodied bird with largely white wings and black wingtips, very similar to the bird in the Luneau video; compare in particular Figure 1B, frame 758, with Figure 1A, frame 283.3. The expected appearance of the upperwing of <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span> – mostly black with a small white patch at the base of the primaries – is often not seen, and is only clearly resolvable when birds are flying near-vertically before landing on a tree trunk; something the bird in the Luneau video did not do.
2. The black trailing edge to the underwing of <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span> is often very inconspicuous and may disappear completely. Due to motion and flexion of the wing, the black trailing edge is much more obvious towards the wingtips. This produces an apparent plumage pattern that matches the patterns shown by the Luneau video bird (compare Figure 1B, frames 175 and 457 with Figure 1A, frames 300 and 416.7). In many frames of <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span>, a black trailing edge to the wing is discernable (though due to bleeding of white as a video artifact, it appears narrower than it really is). However, analysis of the bird in the Luneau video in light of images of known <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> confirms that a similar black trailing edge to the wing is discernable in some frames of the Luneau video (compare Figure 1B, frame 775 with Figure 1A, frame 366.7: the apparent plumage patterns are similar, and inconsistent with <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span>). It is argued here that the hypothesis put forward in Sibley et al [4] is correct, and that the black trailing edge of the underwing of <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span> can indeed, due to flexion of the wings during the downstroke, be misinterpreted as the black leading edge and wingtips of the upperwing of an <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span>.
3. Figure 3 shows that the plumage patterns shown by the Luneau bird, throughout several wingbeat cycles, are compatible with <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span>. The three plumage features described in Sibley et al [4] that are incompatible with <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> (black secondary feathers on upper surface of left wing, brighter white primary bases, and a black band curling round the wing tip) are seen consistently in the Luneau video and are recapitulated throughout the video of <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span>.<br><br>
Discussion
Evidence is presented here to show that the distinctive plumage features of <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span> are surprisingly difficult to resolve in poor-quality video of birds in escape flight away from the camera, and that they can show apparent plumage patterns that might more readily be associated with <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span>. Irrespective of the identity of the bird in the Luneau video, this knowledge will be critical to assessment of further claims of <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpeckers</span> during the current intensive search effort. It is, however, suggested here that critical frames used for identification of the Luneau video woodpecker as an <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> are also consistent with <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span>. The wingbeat frequency of the bird in the Luneau video is also perhaps consistent with <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span>, at least for short periods of flight.
Analysis of the videos of <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span> has supported the hypothesised interpretations of key frames of the Luneau video by Sibley et al [4]. Although the rebuttal of that comment in Fitzpatrick et al [5] asserted that flexion and motion of wings of <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> could not produce the images seen in the Luneau video, it has been shown here that they can.
The Luneau video as presented in Fitzpatrick et al [1], shows features that are consistent with <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span>, and inconsistent with <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span>. It is argued in this paper that, in fact, the black trailing edge of the wing of a <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span> is seen clearly in the Luneau video, during the downstroke of the wingbeat cycle, but that it has been misinterpreted as black wingtips (Figure 1, 2, 3).
A fuller analysis of the Luneau video by the Cornell University team is presented online [7]. Although it is not peer-reviewed, the points this article makes should be taken into account. The authors summarise nine diagnostic traits from their analysis of the Luneau video that identify the bird as <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span>. These are listed and discussed point-by point below.
1. 'The underwing pattern in flight consistently appears largely white, giving the appearance of having black wingtips but lacking any black along the rear, or trailing edge.'
Data presented in this paper show that this statement is not wholly supported, and in any case the underwing of <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> can present the same appearance.
2. 'The upperwing pattern in flight consistently shows a broad, white trailing edge, with no frames demonstrating the conspicuous dark rear border to be expected of normal <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span>.'
Notwithstanding that certain frames of the Luneau video (e.g. frame 350) do appear to show a black trailing edge to the upperwing, data presented in this paper shows that, at this angle of view and resolution of video, <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> also may fail to show this feature. This analysis has shown that the hypothesis presented in Sibley et al [4] is plausible, i.e. that some of the frames interpreted by [1] to show the upperwing of an <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> may in fact show large amounts of white and the black trailing edge from the underwing of a <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span>.
3. 'The wings are longer relative to the body diameter than in <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span> and consistent with the wing shape of <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span>.'
Fitzpatrick et al [5] agreed that accurate measurements were not possible from the video images presented in their original paper [1], and it seems unlikely that much confidence can be placed in the wing-length measurements of the bird in the Luneau video. Comparison of, for example, Figure 1A, frame 283.3 with Figure 1B, frame 578 suggests that any differences will be very difficult to prove.
4. 'Reenactment of the scene using life-sized, realistically painted, dynamically flapping models produced images remarkably similar to those of the Luneau video using the <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> model, and images clearly identifiable as <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span> using a model of that species.'
Interpretation of model re-enactments is hampered by the fact that the stiff, flat-winged models cannot reflect the wing flexion and curvature of real birds. Reenactment of the scene using real <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> has produced images remarkably similar to the Luneau video.
5. 'The wingbeat frequency is 8.6 beats per second, which is almost identical to that recorded for <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> (as documented by one acoustic record from 1935). The wing-beat frequencies of <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span> are not known to exceed 7.5 beats per second, and more typically range between 3 and 6 beats per second.'
The fact that in only four recorded escape flights of <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span>, two were recorded for which the initial escape flight wingbeat frequency (8.0 s-1 and 8.6 s-1) exceeded that previously recorded for this species shows that previous datasets were too limited to make this conclusion. Birds flap more rapidly at take off to gain altitude and speed than they do in sustained level flight: <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span> flight data in the literature [1,4,5] was derived from the work of Tobalske [8], which explicitly excluded the initial take-off period, and therefore cannot be used to support the elimination of <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span> in the Luneau video. Furthermore, the bird in the Luneau video is consistently gaining height from a low position above water and, whatever its species, might be expected to flap more rapidly than if it were in level flight. Tanner [9] noted that <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> can maintain extended fast direct flight. He was of the opinion that flight pattern was not a useful character for separating the two species in the field, and that <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> frequently <span class="yellow">fly</span> in a manner that was in no way different to <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpeckers</span>.
The figure of 8.6 wingbeats per second for the Luneau bird (data reanalysed here) is taken as consistent with <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> on the basis of analysis of a single archival audio recording [3]. The <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> in that audio tape is clearly flapping its wings, but without accompanying visual confirmation it is not clear that it is in flight. In general, larger birds are expected to flap their wings more slowly than smaller birds of comparable wing morphology. Tobalske [8] showed that, across species, smaller woodpeckers tend to flap more quickly than larger ones, and that there was considerable intraspecific variation. The assertion that <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpeckers</span> flap their wings more quickly than <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> is therefore counterintuitive. Further comment is conjecture: while the flight pattern and wing posture of the bird in the Luneau video may be unusual, it has not been shown that it is outside the range of variability of <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span>, and cannot therefore be used to eliminate the possibility that it was the commoner species.
6. 'White plumage on the back is visible on the retreating bird as it begins to gain altitude. <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> has white on the back; <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span> has entirely black back.'
This was discussed by Sibley et al [4], who argued that the images thought to show white on the dorsum were too small to be accepted uncritically. In all the frames of the Luneau video that appear to show white on the dorsum, the bird is distant (dorsal white is not visible on the higher resolution images earlier in the video) and partially obscured, making it difficult to distinguish dorsum from wing. Spurious areas of white pixels appear as artifacts in both videos. Nevertheless, this remains the best evidence that the Luneau bird was not a standard <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span>.
7. 'The dorsal view of the right wing as it begins to unfold shows a triangle of white that matches in size and position the white on the folded wing of an <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> beginning to launch into flight.'
No further comment is provided here. An alternative explanation was offered by Sibley et al [4] and rebutted by Fitzpatrick et al [5]. The statement requires a degree of certainty about the position of the wing.
(8) 'The distance between the wrist area and the tip of the tail (32–36 cm, as measured when the bird begins to take flight) is comparable to known measurements of <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> and considerably larger than even the largest <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span> we measured.'
As stated under (3), above, there is general agreement that accurate measurements are not possible from the Luneau video because too many uncontrolled variables are involved [4,5].
9. 'Only 20 seconds before the woodpecker flees, a bird with the size and color pattern of an <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> was perched within 3 m of the site from which the woodpecker took flight.'
This would be a strong argument if it could be shown that the object in question was a bird and not, as is now apparently thought likely, a section of branch or tree stump [10]. The Luneau video reveals several white triangular patches apparently visible on or around tree trunks, most or all of which must therefore be images of tree topography or video artifacts. This was discussed in the literature (see [4,5]).
Central to the identification of the flying bird seen in the Luneau video was the evidence that plumage and flight patterns were inconsistent with <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span>. A very basic video analysis presented here has suggested that this may not be the case, and that further research is needed. Any identification of the bird in the Luneau video as an <span class="yellow">Ivory-bill</span> must take into account the data presented here and in Sibley et al [4], which shows it is largely consistent with <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span> and points out apparent inconsistencies with <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span>. This does not of course necessarily imply that the <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> is extinct, nor indeed entirely rule out the possibility that the bird in the Luneau video was one. There appears to be no reason to question the anecdotal sight records of <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> presented in Fitzpatrick et al [1] (or in many online sources), because some of them appear credible, albeit brief. Audio evidence has since been published [11] although this too is far from conclusive. However, to regard the Luneau video by itself as presenting anything other than an unidentified woodpecker falls below the standards of proof normally required for scientific publication: the images are not good enough. The <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> may persist in continental North America, and there is enough anecdotal evidence to make this a possibility, but the Luneau video does not support the case. The balance of evidence would suggest that the bird in the Luneau video is more likely to have been a <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span>, but the search for <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> should continue.
While this paper was under review, a report of sight records and sound recordings of <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpeckers</span> was published from a location in Florida [12]. This very exciting claim is strengthened by reports of sighting of the white dorsal stripes on one bird in flight. Unfortunately, several sightings were made without optical aids and cannot be considered proven. The 'kent' calls recorded from the Florida location are spectrographically similar to the 'bleat' calls of young <span class="yellow">White-tailed Deer</span>, as described in Richardson et al [13]. A clear photograph will be required from this location too before the presence of <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpeckers</span> can be considered confirmed. It is hoped that this paper will help with assessment of any further low quality photographs or videos.<br><br>Conclusion
Flight and plumage patterns of the putative <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> recorded in Arkansas in 2005 are recapitulated by confirmed <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span>. The bird in the Arkansas video is best regarded as not fully identified, and is probably a <span class="blue">Pileated Woodpecker</span>.<br><br>Methods
Video recording
<span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> were attracted to a bird feeder containing suet at Grants Trail, Dayton, OH 45459. The suet feeder was placed approximately 2.1 m high on a tree trunk, and the distance to the suet feeder from the observation point was approximately 5 m. Birds on the feeder were startled by movement of window blinds on January 28 and February 5, 2006, and their escape flights were filmed using a Sony Hi-8 SteadyShot video camera at 29.97 frames s-1. At least two birds feature in the videos, male and female.
Analogue tape was converted to digital by connecting the Hi-8 camera directly to a Sony DCR-HC30 digital video camera and recording onto that camera's mini dv cassette. The resulting images were converted to an avi file using Windows Movie Maker on a Windows XP PC. The video is freely available in wmv format [14] and in avi format from the author or David Nolin (via the author). The video was decompiled using Blaze Media Pro (Mystik Media, Hampstead, NC, USA) for a detailed analysis. Import into Avid® Xpress Pro HD for deinterlacing did not reduce the wing flicker seen in the images, and further professional processing could not improve the resolution, so the original decompiled file was used for analysis. Hence some frames contain two overlaid images, which may lower the resolution in some cases. The decompiled file was examined frame by frame and compared to the decompiled images of the putative <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> presented in Fitzpatrick et al [1].
Wingbeat frequencies were calculated by noting the frame number of the midpoint of the downstroke of each wingbeat (e.g. Figure 1B, frame 758) and calculating the length of time taken per wingbeat as (number of frames between downstroke midpoints)/29.97.<br><br>
