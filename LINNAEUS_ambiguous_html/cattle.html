Abstract
Background
The link between poverty and health is central to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Poverty can be both a cause and consequence of poor health, but there are few epidemiological studies exploring this complex relationship. The aim of this study was to examine the association between visual impairment from cataract and poverty in adults in Kenya, Bangladesh, and the Philippines.<br><br>Methods and Findings
A population-based case–control study was conducted in three countries during 2005–2006. Cases were <span class="yellow">persons</span> aged 50 y or older and visually impaired due to cataract (visual acuity < 6/24 in the better eye). Controls were <span class="yellow">persons</span> age- and sex-matched to the case <span class="yellow">participants</span> with normal vision selected from the same cluster. Household expenditure was assessed through the collection of detailed consumption data, and asset ownership and self-rated wealth were also measured. In total, 596 cases and 535 controls were included in these analyses (Kenya 142 cases, 75 controls; Bangladesh 216 cases, 279 controls; Philippines 238 cases, 180 controls). Case <span class="yellow">participants</span> were more likely to be in the lowest quartile of per capita expenditure (PCE) compared to controls in Kenya (odds ratio = 2.3, 95% confidence interval 0.9–5.5), Bangladesh (1.9, 1.1–3.2), and the Philippines (3.1, 1.7–5.7), and there was significant dose–response relationship across quartiles of PCE. These associations persisted after adjustment for self-rated health and social support indicators. A similar pattern was observed for the relationship between cataract visual impairment with asset ownership and self-rated wealth. There was no consistent pattern of association between PCE and level of visual impairment due to cataract, sex, or age among the three countries.<br><br>Conclusions
Our data show that <span class="yellow">people</span> with visual impairment due to cataract were poorer than those with normal sight in all three low-income countries studied. The MDGs are committed to the eradication of extreme poverty and provision of health care to poor <span class="yellow">people</span>, and this study highlights the need for increased provision of cataract surgery to poor <span class="yellow">people</span>, as they are particularly vulnerable to visual impairment from cataract.<br><br>Background.
Globally, about 45 million <span class="yellow">people</span> are blind. As with many other conditions, avoidable blindness (preventable or curable blindness) is a particular problem for <span class="yellow">people</span> in developing countries—90% of blind <span class="yellow">people</span> live in poor regions of the world. Although various infections and disorders can cause blindness, cataract is the most common cause. In cataract, which is responsible for half of all cases of blindness in the world, the lens of the eye gradually becomes cloudy. Because the lens focuses light to produce clear, sharp images, as cataract develops, vision becomes increasingly foggy or fuzzy, colors become less intense, and the ability to see shapes against a background declines. Eventually, vision may be lost completely. Cataract can be treated with an inexpensive, simple operation in which the cloudy lens is surgically removed and an artificial lens is inserted into the eye to restore vision. In developed countries, this operation is common and easily accessible but many poor countries lack the resources to provide the operation to everyone who needs it. In addition, blind <span class="yellow">people</span> often cannot afford to travel to the hospitals where the operation, which also may come with a fee, is done.<br><br>Why Was This Study Done?
Because blindness may reduce earning potential, many experts believe that poverty and blindness (and, more generally, poor health) are inextricably linked. <span class="yellow">People</span> become ill more often in poor countries than in wealthy countries because they have insufficient food, live in substandard housing, and have limited access to health care, education, water, and sanitation. Once they are ill, their ability to earn money may be reduced, which increases their personal poverty and slows the economic development of the whole country. Because of this potential link between health and poverty, improvements in health are at the heart of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, a set of eight goals established in 2000 with the primary aim of reducing world poverty. However, few studies have actually investigated the complex relationship between poverty and health. Here, the researchers investigate the association between visual impairment from cataract and poverty among adults living in three low-income countries.<br><br>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
The researchers identified nearly 600 <span class="yellow">people</span> aged 50 y or more with severe cataract-induced visual impairment (“cases”) primarily through a survey of the population in Kenya, Bangladesh, and the Philippines. They matched each case to a normally sighted (“control”) <span class="yellow">person</span> of similar age and sex living nearby. They then assessed a proxy for the income level, measured as “per capita expenditure” (PCE), of all the study <span class="yellow">participants</span> (<span class="yellow">people</span> with cataracts and controls) by collecting information about what their households consumed. The <span class="yellow">participants</span>' housing conditions and other assets and their self-rated wealth were also measured. In all three countries, cases were more likely to be in the lowest quarter (quartile) of the range of PCEs for that country than controls. In the Philippines, for example, <span class="yellow">people</span> with cataract-affected vision were three times more likely than normally sighted controls to have a PCE in the lowest quartile than in the highest quartile. The risk of cataract-related visual impairment increased as PCE decreased in all three countries. Similarly, severe cataract-induced visual impairment was more common in those who owned fewer assets and those with lower self-rated wealth. However, there was no consistent association between PCE and the level of cataract-induced visual impairment.<br><br>What Do These Findings Mean?
These findings show that there is an association between visual impairment caused by cataract and poverty in Kenya, Bangladesh, and the Philippines. However, because the financial circumstances of the <span class="yellow">people</span> in this study were assessed after cataracts had impaired their sight, this study does not prove that poverty is a cause of visual impairment. A causal connection between poverty and cataract can only be shown by determining the PCEs of normally sighted <span class="yellow">people</span> and following them for several years to see who develops cataract. Nevertheless, by confirming an association between poverty and blindness, these findings highlight the need for increased provision of cataract surgery to poor <span class="yellow">people</span>, particularly since cataract surgery has the potential to improve the quality of life for many <span class="yellow">people</span> in developing countries at a relatively low cost.<br><br>Additional Information.

Improvements in health are at the heart of the Millennium Development Goals, with the recognition that better health is central to the primary aim of reducing poverty as well as important in its own right. Empirical data are needed to back up this claim. Unravelling the relationship between blindness and poverty therefore has important implications, and may also be informative for the association between poverty and other disabilities.
Blindness is a common condition globally, affecting approximately 45 million <span class="yellow">people</span>, and more than a third of blindness is caused by cataract [1,2]. Globally, the prevalence of blindness is five-fold higher in poor than rich countries [2]. Limited data show that within countries the poor are also more likely to be blind [3,4]. It is frequently asserted that blindness is both a cause and consequence of poverty, but there are few empirical data to support this claim. Poverty may cause cataract blindness, because access to cataract surgery is limited in low-income countries [5]. Furthermore, within poor countries some evidence suggests that lack of money is a major barrier to uptake of cataract surgery by individuals [6–8]. Blindness may also cause poverty, as the blind individual, or the household members who care for them, have a reduced earning potential [4,9]. This complex problem could have serious implications; estimates from The Gambia suggest that there is a substantial economic burden from lost productivity among blind <span class="yellow">people</span> [10]. Therefore, blindness prevention may ultimately be cost saving [11]. Extrapolations on a global level indicate that a successful eye care programme could prevent more than 100 million cases of blindness between 2000 and 2020, and consequently save at least US$102 billion, which would otherwise be lost to reductions in productivity associated with blindness [12]. However, these estimates are based on extrapolations from limited data and were not based on individual-level data. It is also difficult to identify the component of productivity loss that is due to blindness, as this condition mainly affects older <span class="yellow">people</span>, who may suffer from other comorbidities that restrict their employment opportunities or make them dependent on the care of others.
The Cataract Impact Study was undertaken to assess the relationship between cataract visual impairment and “economic poverty” and quality of life, and to estimate the impact of cataract surgery on these factors in three low-income countries. The aim of the current paper is to assess the association at baseline between visual impairment from cataract and household poverty (measured through consumption, asset ownership, and self-rated wealth) in a population-based case–control study in Kenya, the Philippines, and Bangladesh.<br><br>Methods
Setting
Case and control <span class="yellow">participants</span> were recruited from Nakuru district, Kenya (January–February, 2005); Negros island (May–June, 2005) and Antique district (April–May, 2006), Philippines; and Satkhira district, Bangladesh (November–December, 2005).<br><br>Selection of Cases and Controls
<span class="yellow">Persons</span> with cataract visual impairment (cases) and <span class="yellow">persons</span> without (controls) were primarily recruited through a population-based survey of adults aged ≥ 50 y [6–8]. Clusters of 50 <span class="yellow">people</span> (regardless of visual impairment) aged ≥ 50 y were selected through probability-proportionate to size sampling, using either the census (Philippines and Bangladesh) or electoral role (Kenya) as the sampling frame. Households within clusters were selected through a modification of compact segment sampling, whereby a map was drawn of the enumeration area that was divided into segments, each including approximately 50 <span class="yellow">people</span> aged ≥ 50 y, and one segment was chosen at random [13]. Households in the segment were included sequentially until 50 <span class="yellow">people</span> aged ≥ 50 y were identified. The surveys included 3,503 (93% response rate) <span class="yellow">people</span> aged ≥ 50 y in Kenya, 4,868 (92%) in Bangladesh, 2,774 (76%) in Negros, and 3,177 (83%) in Antique.
All <span class="yellow">people</span> in the survey aged ≥ 50 y underwent visual acuity (VA) testing and ophthalmic examination. VA was measured in full daylight with available spectacle correction with a Snellen tumbling “E” chart using optotype size 6/18 (20/60) on one side and size 6/60 (20/200) on the other side at 6 or 3 metres. If the VA was <6/18 in either eye then pinhole vision was also measured. <span class="yellow">Participants</span> with pinhole vision <6/18 but >6/60 in the better eye due to age-related cataract were given a second VA test using an “E” of size 6/24. The ophthalmologist examined all eyes with a presenting VA <6/18 with a torch (i.e., flashlight), direct ophthalmoscope, and/or portable slit lamp. The principal cause of blindness or visual impairment was recorded, according to the WHO convention in which the major cause is assigned to the primary disorder or, if there are two existing primary disorders, to the one that is easiest to treat [14].
Survey <span class="yellow">participants</span> were eligible for inclusion as cases if they were aged ≥ 50 y with best corrected visual acuity <6/24 in the better eye due to cataract, as diagnosed by an ophthalmologist. All eligible cases identified from these surveys were invited to participate in the study. <span class="yellow">Participants</span> were eligible to be controls if they were aged ≥ 50 y, did not have VA <6/24 in the better eye due to cataract and did not live in the same household as a case. During the survey a list was maintained of all eligible controls, by age group (50–54, 55–59, 60–64, 65–69, and >70) and sex. Whenever a case was identified, one age- and sex-matched control was randomly selected from the list for inclusion (or up to two controls in Bangladesh). If no matching eligible controls had been identified in that cluster at that stage of the survey, then the next eligible control in the cluster was recruited.
Because of logistical and time constraints, additional cases were also included through community-based case detection. In Kenya and Negros (Philippines), clusters were randomly selected through probability proportionate to size using the same cluster sampling procedure after completion of the population-based survey. Clusters were visited in advance and asked that all <span class="yellow">people</span> ≥ 50 y with vision problems come to a central point on a specified day, and that a list be made of <span class="yellow">people</span> unable to attend (e.g., due to blindness or other physical disability). After examining <span class="yellow">patients</span> at the central point, the survey team then visited those unable to leave their houses. Any identified eligible cases that agreed to be part of the study were interviewed in their homes. In Bangladesh and Antique (Philippines), community case detection was carried out simultaneously with the survey by two of the four teams, so that controls were included for these cases. Within each cluster from the survey, one interviewer was asked to be taken to two community members aged ≥ 50 y with eye problems, living within the cluster boundaries but not from the segments selected for the survey. If VA was <6/24 with pinhole in the better eye, the ophthalmologist was called to carry out the full eye examination, and eligible cases were included in the study.
For the purposes of the present analyses, control individuals with any visual impairment (VA <6/18 in the better eye) were excluded (n = 14 in Kenya, n = 53 in Bangladesh, n = 24 in the Philippines). Case and control <span class="yellow">participants</span> who were significantly communication impaired (e.g. deafness, dementia, or psychiatric disease) were excluded (fewer than five per country), and one case was excluded in the Philippines because of missing age data. One household had two eligible cases (Kenya), and one of these <span class="yellow">participants</span> was excluded for the poverty analyses as poverty was assessed through household level indicators (see below).
In total, 147 cases (82 from the survey and 65 from case detection) and 79 controls were included in Kenya; 217 cases (162 from survey and 55 from case detection) and 280 controls in Bangladesh; and 238 cases (146 survey and 92 case detection) and 180 controls in the Philippines.<br><br>Data Collection
All case and control <span class="yellow">participants</span> were interviewed in their homes by trained interviewers in the local language. Each interview lasted approximately 1 h.
Measures of poverty.
Poverty was measured through (a) monthly per capita expenditure (PCE) to indicate consumption, (b) asset ownership, and (c) self-rated wealth. The economic part of the questionnaires was adapted through interviews, focus group discussions, and pilot testing in each country to ensure local relevance.
The <span class="yellow">person</span> primarily responsible for household finances (which may have been the case/control or another household member) was interviewed to assess PCE and assets. PCE was measured using methods based on the World Bank's Living Standards Measurement Study [15]. Items were included on food (42–52 items per country), education (three items), health (five items), household expenses (nine items), and personal expenses (21 or 22 items). In total, 85 items were included in the questionnaire in Kenya, 90 in the Philippines, and 79 in Bangladesh. The informant was asked to recall the monetary value of food that was purchased, consumed from home production, or received as payment in kind or as gifts. Consumption was assessed over a 1-wk period for frequently consumed items, and this was scaled up to estimate monthly consumption. The amount consumed monthly was assessed for items that were consumed more rarely. Monthly rent was recorded among households who rented, and households who owned their property were asked to estimate the amount that they could charge in rent per month. The consumption on all items was summed to calculate total monthly household consumption, and this was converted to United States dollars (US$) at the 2005 exchange rate ($1 = 76 Kenya shillings, 64 Bangladesh taka, 55 Philippine pesos). Total monthly household consumption was divided by the number of household members to calculate monthly PCE for the household.
The household informant was also asked about the number and type of context-specific assets owned by the household, including different types of furniture, electrical equipment, <span class="blue">cattle</span>, and vehicles. Information was collected on household characteristics, including the building material of the floor, roof, and walls; type of toilet; and the number of rooms.
Self-rated wealth was assessed by asking the household informant to rank the household's wealth relative to others in the community on a scale from 1 (poorest) to 10 (richest).<br><br>Covariates.
Case and control individuals were interviewed about standard sociodemographic indicators, including household composition, education, and employment. Information was collected on vision-related quality of life using the World Health Organization Prevention of Blindness and Deafness 20-item Visual Functioning Questionnaire [16,17], and health-related quality of life was assessed using items from the European Quality of Life Questionnaire [18]. Detailed time-use data were collected using methods based on the World Bank's Living Standards Measurement Study [15].<br><br>
Training and Fieldwork
Interviewers were trained for 1 wk, including 2 d of pilot testing. Attempts were made to minimise measurement bias by emphasising the need for consistency in data collection among cases and controls. The questionnaires were translated into the local languages (three in Kenya, three in the Philippines, and one in Bangladesh) and back-translated by independent translators (one for each language) who were also asked to comment on appropriateness of language used for the target population. A review was held to discuss differences in translation and modify accordingly. The questionnaire was piloted in each setting and small modifications to wording of some items were made, where appropriate, to ensure local understanding. Teams were accompanied by a field supervisor at least 1 d per wk to ensure that high quality was maintained and interviews were observed randomly throughout the study.<br><br>Statistical Analysis
Microsoft Access was used for data entry, and all data were double entered and validated. Analyses were undertaken in SAS version 8.2.
The mean and range of each expenditure item was calculated to assess whether answers were plausible, and to identify and exclude gross outliers (none identified). Rental equivalents were imputed based on household characteristics and non-rent expenditure for households where these estimates were missing or unreasonably low (< $1 per mo) (four in Kenya, three in Bangladesh, 18 in the Philippines). Total monthly household consumption was divided by the number of household members to calculate per capita household expenditure. Per capita household expenditure was divided into quartiles, separately for each country, based on the distribution of the data for the case and control <span class="yellow">participants</span> combined. Households with incomplete expenditure data were excluded from analyses (five cases and four controls in Kenya; one case and one control in Bangladesh).
A relative index of household assets was derived using principal components analysis (PCA) to determine weights for a list of assets and wealth indicators [19]. Variables entered into the PCA included building materials of the house, ownership of ten household assets, animal ownership, and education of the head of the household. The derived index was divided into quartiles from poorest (lowest socioeconomic status [SES] index) to least poor (highest SES index). PCA analyses were undertaken separately for each country. The means of the poverty variables were first compared for cases recruited through the two different methods, and then from cases and controls using t-tests for continuous variables (e.g., PCE and assets). For categorical variables (e.g., household rank) we used the Mann-Whitney test and presented medians and interquartile ranges. PCE was highly skewed and therefore was log transformed for the t-tests. The two-way correlations were calculated between PCE, assets, and household rank, in turn.
Logistic regression analyses were undertaken separately for each country, assessing the association between case/control status and sociodemographic and poverty variables. Conditional logistic regression was not undertaken, since the matching was incomplete, so all analyses were adjusted for the matching variables (age, sex, and rural/urban location). Likelihood ratio tests were undertaken to assess the significance of adding covariates with more than two levels (e.g., age groups, self-rated health groups) to the model. Tests for trend were undertaken across quartiles of the poverty variables and assessed using the p-value for trend. Analyses were also conducted adjusting for the logistic regression analyses for poverty by social support indicators (marital status and household size) and self-rated health, since these variables may confound the association between cataract visual impairment and poverty. Analyses from the Philippines were also adjusted for study site, since data were obtained from two settings (Negros and Antique). An attempt was made to disentangle the relationship between poverty and cataract by stratifying the analyses by age, sex, and level of visual impairment among the cases.<br><br>Ethical Approval
Informed signed or thumb-printed consent was obtained from all cases and controls. In Kenya and Bangladesh all cases were offered free cataract surgery at the local hospital, with free transport. In the Philippines, <span class="yellow">patients</span> were referred for surgery, which was subsidised for <span class="yellow">patients</span> who could not afford the fee. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the ethics committees of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, the Kenya Medical Research Institute, the Bangladesh Medical Research Council, and the University of St. La Salle, Bacolod, Philippines. This study complied with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.<br><br>
Results
Sociodemographic Characteristics of Cases and Controls
Case and control <span class="yellow">participants</span> were matched reasonably closely by sex and location. However, within the age category ≥ 70 y, cases tended to be older than the controls, so that cases were over-represented in the oldest age groups (75–79 and ≥ 80 y) compared to controls (Table 1). Cases were less likely to be married than controls, in Kenya (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.3–1.1), Bangladesh (0.6, 0.4–1.0), and the Philippines (0.7, 0.4–1.0), although this only reached statistical significance in Bangladesh (p = 0.03). There was a strong protective effect of literacy and education on cataract in Bangladesh and Kenya that was not evident in the Philippines. Cases were substantially less likely to have a job other than working in the field compared to controls in all three countries. Cases reported significantly poorer self-rated health than controls—this pattern was particularly evident in the Philippines (OR for lowest versus highest quartile of self-rated health = 5.7, 95% CI 3.0–10.7) but also apparent in Kenya (2.6, 1.1–6.2) and Bangladesh (3.3, 2.1–5.3).<br><br>Summary Wealth Measures
All three settings were poor. The mean PCE was less than US$1 per <span class="yellow">person</span> per day in all three settings: US$26.4 (standard deviation [SD] = US$34.9) in Kenya, US$21.7 (US$48.0) in Bangladesh and US$26.1 (US$23.5) in the Philippines. The biggest expense was food in all three settings, making up 55% of PCE in Kenya, 47% in Bangladesh, and 64% in the Philippines, followed by household expenses including rent (21% in Kenya, 28% Bangladesh, and 22% Philippines) (Figure 1). The majority of food consumption was from direct purchase (70% in Kenya, 75% in Bangladesh, and 77% in the Philippines) or home-grown production (24% in Kenya, 22% in Bangladesh, and 17% in the Philippines), and little was from gifts or payments.
An asset score was created through PCA in the three settings. The first principal component explained 22% of the variability in asset variables in Kenya, 25% in Bangladesh, and 24% in the Philippines. Self-perceived wealth of the household clustered around the average with a large proportion of households in Kenya (48%), Bangladesh (43%), and the Philippines (64%); households stating that they were ranked between 4 and 6, on a scale from 1 to 10, in terms of wealth in their community. The three measures of poverty were highly correlated, each showing significant correlation (p < 0.001) with the other measure.<br><br>Economic and Household Characteristics of Cases and Controls
There were no significant differences in PCE, assets, or household rank between cases recruited through the population-based survey and those recruited through case detection, with the exception that the case-detection cases had lower household rank in Kenya (mean = 3.7 versus 3.1, p = 0.02). Consequently, cases recruited through the two methods were combined in the subsequent analyses.
Cases were poorer than controls, in all three settings according to all three poverty measurements (Table 2). The mean PCE was 20%–28% lower for members of households with a case than for control households, and this difference was highly significant in Bangladesh and the Philippines; for Kenya it was lower but did not reach significance (p = 0.07). The PCA score for assets was significantly lower among cases than controls in Kenya and Bangladesh, and it was lower in the Philippines although it did not reach significance (p = 0.06). Self-perceived wealth was significantly lower for households with a case compared to control households in Kenya (3.4 versus 4.5) and Bangladesh (3.9 versus 4.6), though not in the Philippines (4.1 versus 4.3).
There was no difference in the size of the households of cases and controls in any of the three settings. The ratio of dependents (i.e., household member aged <15 or ≥ 50 y) to independents (i.e., household member aged 15–50 y) was similar between cases and controls in Bangladesh (1.4 versus 1.4), but the dependency ratio was higher for controls than cases in Kenya (2.1 versus 1.6) and the Philippines (1.7 versus 1.3), due to the smaller number of <span class="yellow">people</span> of working age.<br><br>Patterns of Expenditure in Cases and Controls
Figure 1 shows the total PCE and the allocation of expenditure within quartiles of PCE for cases and controls. Monthly PCE was similar for cases and controls within each of the quartiles of expenditure. There was a gradual increase in PCE between the first three quartiles, and then a rapid increase between the third and the richest quartile. Within the first three quartiles of PCE the majority of expenditure was on food. Substantial expenditure on non-food items was observed only in the highest quartile of expenditure, where about half of expenditure was on non-food items. Similar patterns of PCE were observed for cases and controls in Kenya, Bangladesh, and the Philippines within each quartile of expenditure. These results demonstrate that cataract visual impairment was related to reduced PCE, but not allocation of expenditure.<br><br>Multivariate Analyses of Poverty and Cataract Visual Impairment
Multivariate analyses showed that case <span class="yellow">participants</span> were consistently poorer than controls in Kenya, Bangladesh, and the Philippines, using three different measures of poverty (Table 3). Cases were more likely than controls to be in the lowest quartile of PCE rather than the highest quartile in Kenya (OR 2.3, 95% CI 0.9–5.5), Bangladesh (1.9, 1.1–3.2) and the Philippines (3.1, 1.7–5.7). In all three settings these associations showed significant dose–response as assessed by the p-value for trend across the quartiles, with decreasing PCE related to case status and these relationships persisted after adjustment for self-rated health and social support indicators. A similar pattern was observed for the relationship between case–control status and asset ownership. Cases were significantly more likely to be in the lowest quartile of asset ownership rather than the highest quartile compared to controls in Kenya (3.7, 1.4–9.6), Bangladesh (2.6, 1.5–4.4), and the Philippines (2.1, 1.1–3.8). Cases were also significantly more likely to be in the lowest quartile of household rank rather than the highest, compared to controls in Kenya (3.5, 1.5–8.0), Bangladesh (2.7, 1.6–4.7) and the Philippines (2.3, 1.1–4.8). The associations with assets and household rank also showed a significant dose–response relationship, and the associations were largely unchanged after adjustment for self-rated health and social support indicators. In Kenya and Bangladesh the relationship between PCE and case status was somewhat weaker than for the other measures of poverty, while the reverse was true in the Philippines.
Stratifying the association between PCE and cataract visual impairment by level of visual impairment showed an inconsistent pattern (Table 4). In Kenya, the association with low PCE was somewhat stronger comparing cataract blind cases to controls (OR 3.1, 95% CI 0.9–10.8) than comparing moderate visually impaired cases to controls (1.8, 0.6–5.4), while this pattern was reversed in Bangladesh (blind cases versus controls: 1.8, 1.0–3.4; moderately visually impaired cases versus controls: 3.1, 1.3–7.2). In the Philippines the association with low PCE was strongest comparing severely visually impaired cases to controls (5.9, 2.0–17.6). The association between cataract visual impairment and PCE was stronger among <span class="yellow">men</span> than <span class="yellow">women</span> in Bangladesh and the Philippines, while the reverse was true in Kenya (Table 5). In Kenya and the Philippines the strongest association between cataract and PCE was among <span class="yellow">people</span> aged 70–79 y, while in Bangladesh the strongest effect was in <span class="yellow">people</span> aged over 80 y. Stratifying the association between assets and household rank with cataract by level of visual impairment, sex, or age broadly repeated these findings, and generally supported the lack of consistent pattern (unpublished data).<br><br>
Discussion
This large, multicentre population-based case–control study provides evidence that <span class="yellow">people</span> with visual impairment from cataract are poorer than control <span class="yellow">participants</span> with normal vision matched for age and sex. This pattern was evident whether poverty was measured in terms of PCE, assets, or self-rated wealth. Marital status seemed to be protective for cataract visual impairment, possibly indicating the role of social support in health-seeking behaviour. Reduced self-rated health was also strongly related to cataract visual impairment. This demonstrates the impact of poor vision on overall assessments of health and supports our previous finding of a relationship between cataract and quality of life [17].
Adjustment for marital status and self-rated health did not entirely explain the association between poverty and cataract visual impairment, suggesting that it operated through other pathways. Visual impairment could cause poverty through reduced employment opportunities. We might therefore expect to see a stronger relationship between cataract and poverty among the blind case <span class="yellow">participants</span> who may have fewer employment opportunities than among those less impaired (i.e., moderate visual impairment). Poverty may also cause visual impairment through restricted access to cataract surgery. In this case we would expect to see a stronger relationship between poverty and less severely affected cases (i.e., moderate visual impairment), as poor families may allocate money for surgery on members who are blind from cataract, so that poverty mainly restricts access to surgery among <span class="yellow">people</span> who are moderately visually impaired. The relationships that we observed between level of visual impairment and cataract were inconsistent across the three settings. Perhaps this shows that both pathways were operating or that the dynamics of the relationship between poverty and blindness vary in different settings. Levels of literacy and education were lower among cases than controls. These long-term indicators of disadvantage are unlikely to have changed after the onset of cataract. This observation provides some evidence that poverty preceded blindness in our study <span class="yellow">participants</span>.
It is frequently asserted that blindness is both a cause and consequence of poverty, but there are few empirical data to support this claim. Globally, the prevalence of blindness is five-fold higher in poor than rich countries [2], and data from Pakistan and India suggest that within countries the poor are more likely to be blind [3, 4]. Some blinding conditions are a direct consequence of poverty, notably trachoma, which thrives in poor areas lacking water and sanitation [20]. Other blinding diseases clearly contribute to poverty, such as onchocerciasis, which results in the abandonment of the fertile areas near to the rivers where the disease vector thrives [9]. A larger literature shows that poor <span class="yellow">people</span> are more likely to be ill or disabled than their richer compatriots, ranging from general disability in India, Bulgaria, and Ghana [21]; common mental disorders in Brazil, Chile, India, and Zimbabwe [22]; deafness in Brazil [23]; and tuberculosis in China [24]. There are also some exceptions such as a case-control study in Rwanda which failed to show an association between PCE and musculoskeletal impairment, perhaps because the population was almost universally poor [25].
Poverty may increase the incidence of disease, particularly preventable diseases such as tuberculosis. Poverty may also restrict access to appropriate health care and so prolong the duration of disease. A study in rural Tanzania showed that care-seeking behaviour for childhood illness is worse among poorer families than among the relatively rich families [26]. Another Tanzanian study found that <span class="yellow">people</span> with higher levels of asset ownership were more likely to obtain antimalarials even though they were less likely to be parasitaemic [27]. With respect to cataract, there is little evidence that prevention is possible, and so the main pathway from poverty to blindness is likely to be through reduced access to cataract surgical services. High health care costs may also exacerbate poverty. A study in rural China showed that ill health increases medical expenditure significantly, which detracts from expenditure on food, education, investment in farming, and participation in social activities [28]. Inability to afford cataract surgery is cited as the major barrier to the uptake of surgery in the surveys conducted in Kenya, the Philippines, and Bangladesh [6–8]. This indicates that the cost of surgery is perceived as substantial by many households, notwithstanding the problems of assessing the complex issue of barriers in the absence of in-depth qualitative interviews. Consequently, there are lower rates of cataract surgery among the poor [3].
Poverty may also limit the employment opportunities of the <span class="yellow">person</span> with disability or their household members. This pattern has been demonstrated for <span class="yellow">people</span> with <span class="yellow">HIV</span> in South Africa [29], tuberculosis in China [24], or disability in Sri Lanka [22]. An impact of blindness on reduced employment or income has been observed in Guinea [9] and India [4]. A belief that blindness reduces the employment opportunities of household members is widespread, but so far there is limited supportive evidence. There is a further complication to investigations of the relationship between cataract and poverty, as the individuals with cataract are likely to be elderly and facing multiple disabilities. Our study took account of the potential impact of multiple disabilities, as we adjusted for self-rated health, which is closely related to overall health, and this adjustment had no overall impact on our results [30].
Study Strengths
This was a large population-based case–control study, conducted in three countries, allowing international comparisons. This was the first study, to our knowledge, to relate PCE to visual impairment. We also measured assets, which reflects long-term access to resources, and self-rated wealth. We used expenditure as a proxy for income, which has aided both academic and nonacademic investigations. As one example, the notorious Chicago gangster Al Capone managed to escape prosecution for smuggling, gambling, bootlegging, and murder for years, but was eventually convicted of tax evasion, because the jury was convinced that his exorbitant expenses on clothes, furnishing, foods, and gifts were inconsistent with his claim that he had no income. Expenditure often provides a better measure of poverty than income for a number of reasons. Income may be variable by season, whereas households attempt to smooth expenditure over the year. <span class="yellow">People</span> are more comfortable sharing information about expenditure than income, and it may be a more meaningful measure than income in an agrarian society as it reflects what the household is able to command based on its current income, borrowing ability, or household savings [31]. PCE also has advantages over assets, as it may be more responsive to change, which will be important for the follow-up analyses of the study <span class="yellow">participants</span> after they have undergone cataract surgery.<br><br>Study Limitations
There are a number of limitations relating to the measurement of poverty in this study. Our analyses focus on monetary indicators of poverty, while we acknowledge that health, education, and housing are also important. We concede that it is difficult to measure expenditure accurately [32,33], but this also true for the measurement of diet and other variables, which is standard practise in many epidemiological studies. Furthermore, a large number of items were included in our measure of expenditure so that the measure was comprehensive [33]. Expenditure data were not validated through diaries or other means, although assets and self-rated wealth correlated highly with PCE. Other recent estimates of expenditure are not available from surveys conducted in these countries to allow comparison. The per capita estimates of monthly gross national income from the World Development Indicators database show somewhat higher estimates in Kenya (US$48) and Bangladesh (US$40) than our PCE derived estimates, and far higher estimates for the Philippines (US$108). This discrepancy may be reasonable, as the World Development Indicators reflect national averages, while we sampled the households with elderly <span class="yellow">people</span> in poor regions of the country, many of whom were visually impaired from cataract. PCE was calculated simply by dividing the total household expenditure by the number of household members, without inclusion of economies of scale or equivalence scales. There is no widely accepted alternative to the simple equal-sharing convention, and the majority of expenditure was on food which does not allow for economies of scale. Furthermore, there were slightly fewer <span class="yellow">people</span> of working age in the control households in Kenya and the Philippines, so adjustment for equivalence scores would be unlikely to explain the higher poverty among cases. The case and control households were of similar sizes in the three settings, so economies of scales are unlikely to have explained the differences.
There were a number of limitations relating to study design. Unfortunately, we did not record the exact numbers of cases and controls who refused to participate or were unable to communicate (believed to be fewer than five in each country), so the response rate is unknown, but was believed to be high. A variety of methods were used for case recruitment, as we were not able to obtain enough cases through the survey alone. However, cases recruited through the population-based survey and through case detection had similar poverty characteristics.<br><br>Conclusions
Our data show that <span class="yellow">people</span> with visual impairment due to cataract were poorer than controls in three low income countries, Bangladesh, Kenya, and the Philippines. The Millennium Development Goals are committed to the eradication of extreme poverty and provision of health care to poor <span class="yellow">people</span>. This study confirms an association between poverty and blindness and highlights the need for increased provision of cataract surgery to poor <span class="yellow">people</span>, particularly since cataract surgery is a highly cost-effective intervention in these settings [34].<br><br><br><br><h3>pmcA2567314</h3>Syndrome of arachnomelia in Simmental <span class="blue">cattle</span>
Abstract
Background
The syndrome of arachnomelia is an inherited malformation mainly of limbs, back and head in <span class="blue">cattle</span>. At present the arachnomelia syndrome has been well known mainly in Brown Swiss <span class="blue">cattle</span>. Nevertheless, the arachnomelia syndrome had been observed in the Hessian Simmental population during the decade 1964–1974. Recently, stillborn Simmental <span class="yellow">calves</span> were observed having a morphology similar to the arachnomelia syndrome. The goal of this work was the characterization of the morphology and genealogy of the syndrome in Simmental to establish the basis for an effective management of the disease.<br><br>Results
The first pathologically confirmed arachnomelia syndrome-cases in the current Simmental population appeared in the year 2005. By 2007, an additional 140 <span class="yellow">calves</span> with the arachnomelia syndrome were identified. The major pathological findings were malformed bones affecting the head, long bones of the legs and the vertebral column. It could be shown that, with the exception of two cases that were considered as phenocopies, all of the paternal and about two-third of the maternal pedigrees of the affected <span class="yellow">calves</span> could be traced back to one common founder. Together with the data from experimental matings, the pedigree data support an autosomal recessive mutation being the etiology of the arachnomelia syndrome. The frequency of the mutation in the current population was estimated to be 3.32%.<br><br>Conclusion
We describe the repeated occurrence of the arachnomelia syndrome in Simmental <span class="yellow">calves</span>. It resembles completely the same defect occurring in the Brown Swiss breed. The mutation became relatively widespread amongst the current population. Therefore, a control system has to be established and it is highly desirable to map the disease and develop a genetic test system.<br><br><br><br>Background
In the year 2006 a syndrome was described in the German and Austrian Simmental (Fleckvieh, as it is locally called, is the main dual-purpose breed in Germany, in short called Simmental in the further text) population, that was pathologically similar to the arachnomelia syndrome in Brown Swiss <span class="blue">cattle</span> [1]. The congenital arachnomelia syndrome (AS, OMIA Phene ID 139, Group 000059) is mainly a malformation of the skeletal system in <span class="blue">cattle</span> that was initially described by Rieck and Schade [2] in Holstein Friesian, Red Holstein and Simmental.
The main pathological changes are skeletal malformations of the legs, the spinal column and the skull. The legs are thinner and appear longer than normal (dolichostenomelia, arachnomelia) since the diameter of the diaphyses is reduced. These long bones are more fragile and, in combination with stiffened joints, they tend to fracture during calving. The fetlock joints are deformed, often stiffened and show hyperextension. The malformation of the spinal column leads to kyphosis and scoliosis. The skull malformations are characterized by a shortened lower jaw (brachygnathia inferior), convex rounding of the frontal bone leading to a marked stop ("pointer head") and rotation of the anterior cranium. In some cases, additional malformations like hydrocephalus externus develop [2-5].
Since the report of Rieck and Schade [2] no further cases were reported in Simmental <span class="blue">cattle</span>, but in the 1980s the syndrome was dispersed in another breed, the European Brown Swiss <span class="blue">cattle</span>, by the use of American Brown Swiss sires [4,6]. In Brown Swiss an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance was supposed and a control program based on the identification of carriers by pedigree analyses was established [5]. Recently, four cases of arachnomelia syndrome were reported in Italy [3].
In this study, we present the data of 152 pathologically confirmed cases of arachnomelia syndrome in Simmental that were collected from October 2005 to March 2007. We describe the pathological findings, the familial occurrence and an estimate of the frequency of the diseases allele in Simmental <span class="blue">cattle</span>. Additional support for the mode of inheritance and the genetic basis of the arachnomelia syndrome is given by the result of experimental matings of obligate carriers.<br><br>Results and discussion
AS has not been reported again in Simmental since its first description in the 1970s, more than thirteen years ago. In autumn 2004 a number of stillborn <span class="yellow">calves</span> with similar malformations of the legs and head were recorded within the monitoring system of anomalies in Simmental. Some of these <span class="yellow">calves</span> were sent to the veterinary service laboratory for examination, and in December 2005 the first 15 cases of AS were pathologically confirmed. Subsequently, farmers and veterinarians had been encouraged to report cases by an information leaflet and various articles in local trade journals. An increasing number of suspected cases was reported and an additional 136 affected <span class="yellow">calves</span> were identified by pathological examination by June 2007.
Familial occurrence and case presentation of the syndrome of arachnomelia
The geographical origins of the cases were the southern part of Germany and Austria, reflecting the regional distribution of the Simmental breed. Both sexes were equally represented in the 152 (80 male, 72 female, χ2 = 0.21, p = 0.64) affected <span class="yellow">calves</span>. The largest number of cases was registered in 2006 (Figure 1). In retrospect, it could be shown that the main reason for the rapid increase of cases in the years 2005 and 2006 was the high popularity of certain sires carrying the AS mutation (ROMEL, ISO-Nr. 276000911043667, born in 1995; EGEL, 276000915512806, 1985; REXON, 276000913008210, 1989). The latter two sires represent the key-nodes of the pedigree pathways of the mutation from the founder into the current population (Figure 2). ROMEL, for example, sired more than 40,000 <span class="yellow">cows</span> 4 to 6 years ago. Furthermore, 115 sons of ROMEL born from 2001 to 2005 are registered and listed in the breeding database [7]. These progeny were now mated to ROMEL and sons or grandsons of EGEL and REXON resulting in a high probability for the occurrence of affected <span class="yellow">calves</span>. Increasing awareness of the disease and abandoning of selling the semen from carriers led to a sharp drop of cases in 2007. The disease was successfully managed by efficient collaboration of the Institute for Animal Breeding of the Bavarian State Research Centre for Agriculture (LfL), the Landeskuratorium der Erzeugerringe für tierische Veredelung in Bayern e.V (LKV), the Bavarian Animal Health Service (TGD) and breeding organizations.<br><br>Pathological findings
<span class="yellow">Calves</span> under suspicion of the arachnomelia syndrome were sent to the pathology department of the TGD for macroscopic examination. The observed major pathological findings were (1) facial deformation, including brachygnathia inferior and concave rounding of the maxilla forming a dent ('pointer-head'); (2) abnormally thin diaphyses of the long bones (the outer diameter of the diaphyses is diminished, whereas the width of the substantia compacta is normal) leading to frequent fractures of the metacarpus and metatarsus in the course of forced birth assistance ('spider-legs', dolichostenomelia). The deformations of other bones of the legs were less apparent and the scapula was usually unaffected; (3) angular deformations of the distal parts of the legs characterized by bilateral stiff and hyperextended fetlocks with the extremity of the toe forward and parallel to the trunk of the body; and (4) defects of the vertebral column (kyphosis and scoliosis), but not of the ribs (Figure 3A–C). Additionally, inconsistent pathological findings included cerebral herniation combined with a malformed foramen magnum, microphthalmia, and external and internal hydrocephalus. The latter seem to develop secondarily, due to the enlarged foramen magnum.
Histological examination of selected cases revealed the presence of hemorrhages at the osteochondral junction of the epiphysis and an abrupt transmission from chondral to osteogenic tissue.
Cases never showed isolated malformations, e.g. of the head or legs, but usually a combination of all pathological findings that are characteristic for the syndrome. Nevertheless, the degree of the lesions ranged from obvious spider-leg cases to moderate or mild changes, making a definite diagnosis difficult. The latter cases (3) were excluded from the initial pedigree analyses. Meanwhile, an indirect gene test is available that has been developed at the Institute for Animal Breeding of the Bavarian State Research Centre for Agriculture (ITZ) and it could be shown that these cases are most probably not genetically affected (Buitkamp et al., in preparation).<br><br>Carrier identification
Two criteria were used for carrier identification. The first was the presence of a <span class="yellow">calf</span> that was diagnosed by pathological investigation. In many cases more than one affected <span class="yellow">calf</span> per sire was identified [8]. Some sires had only one affected <span class="yellow">calf</span>, but a large number of risk-matings. In these cases a second criterion, the statistical evaluation of risk-matings, was used to identify potential phenocopies. For this purpose, the probability of observing only a single affected <span class="yellow">calf</span> among a certain number of risk-matings of the sire in question was calculated. Risk-matings were defined as matings with direct progenies of identified AS carriers. The probability of observing an affected <span class="yellow">calf</span> depends also on the probability that such a <span class="yellow">calf</span> is reported to the LKV. We assumed this probability to be 50%. Under these conditions, the probability of observing only one affected <span class="yellow">calf</span> is lower than 1.0 percent, if at least 104 risk-matings are given for a single sire. In this case it is very likely that the single affected <span class="yellow">calf</span> is a phenocopy. In 2006 and 2007 this was the case for two sires used for artificial insemination that had no pedigree connection to SEMPER (see below).<br><br>Experimental matings of obligate carriers
Four out of seven <span class="yellow">cows</span> that were known AS carriers brought to the facilities of the ITZ were used for embryo transfer (Table 1). 33 of the 60 recipients (55%) were confirmed pregnant on day 35. Four of the 33 pregnant heifers (12%) aborted between days 36 and 49 of pregnancy. Of the remaining 29 recipients, 6 were slaughtered on day 150, 6 on day 200, and 17 animals on day 225 of pregnancy (Table 1). Four fetuses (three male and one female) out of 29 (14%) showed the typical pathological changes of the arachnomelia syndrome as described above (Figure 4C,D). All other fetuses showed no signs of AS (Figure 4A,B).
Male fetuses represented 76% (22 of 29) of pregnancies (χ2 = 3.123, p = 0.077, Yates corrected for sample size <30). Female weight (Table 2), crown-rump length at day 225 and chest circumference at day 225 of normal fetuses were lower than that of male fetuses. Fetuses that were affected by the arachnomelia syndrome showed lower weight than normal fetuses. The affected and the normal fetuses had similar crown-rump length, but the chest circumference of affected fetuses was higher than that of normal fetuses (Table 2). Due to the small number of affected female fetuses, a comparison with unaffected animals for sex was not possible. To compare unaffected and affected animals in total, the data were analyzed for statistical differences by the non parametric Mann-Whitney-Test. The only trait that was significantly different between unaffected and affected fetuses was the chest circumference (p = 0.004, Table 2). The body weight of AS affected <span class="yellow">calves</span> was tendentially lower than that of normal <span class="yellow">calves</span>. Since affected <span class="yellow">calves</span> did not have different crown-rump-length and their chest circumference was even higher, this can best be explained by a reduced bone mass.<br><br>Pedigree Analysis and mode of inheritance
Eight-generation pedigrees of all cases were extracted from the joint German and Austria pedigree data and screened for common ancestors. The pedigree of the majority of affected <span class="yellow">calves</span> (paternal line 150, maternal line 106 out of 152, Table 3) could be traced back to one founder, SEMPER (ISO-Nr. 27000979299305), a sire born in 1964, 6–9 generations before the affected <span class="yellow">calves</span> were born (Figure 2). Most of the affected <span class="yellow">calves</span> inherited the AS mutation via REXON or EGEL (Table 3, Figure 2). In 44 cases the maternal paths were not linked to the common pedigree (Table 3). One explanation would be the existence of additional, hereto unknown origins of the mutation. This could happen if the AS mutation is much more ancient and additional pedigree paths exist or if an independent mutation event happened leading to the same phenotype. An alternative, more plausible explanation could be the occurrence of misparentages. It is well known that in the pre parentage-test era, the frequency of false paternity, especially of the <span class="yellow">cows</span>, was reasonable high (up to 23% [9]). Therefore, there is a good chance of a false registry within 6–9 generations.
There is strong support for the assumption that the AS is regulated by a single autosomal locus acting in a recessive manner. First of all, the pedigree structure of the affected <span class="yellow">calves</span> in Simmental can best be explained by a recessive mode of inheritance. The paternal branch of the pedigree could be traced back to one sire, SEMPER, for all affected <span class="yellow">calves</span>, the maternal branch in the majority of the cases. Inbreeding loops over a few generations are present in several pedigrees of affected <span class="yellow">calves</span>, e.g. cases P3364 and P1787 (Figure 2). Sex-dependent inheritance can obviously be excluded and a dominant mode with reduced penetrance seems to be unlikely. Secondly, the experimental matings resulted in 4 affected and 25 unaffected fetuses, a result that most closely resembles the expectation of a recessive mode of inheritance. Thirdly, the occurrence of cases corresponded well with the numbers expected under the assumption of a recessively acting mutation. We tested this on the progeny of ROMEL, the largest dataset available from one carrier. We analyzed the period from the beginning of the recording system for malformations to May 2007. In that period 44,170 <span class="yellow">calves</span> were born that were sired by ROMEL. From these, 662 were considered as risk pairings, i.e. the mother had a risk of 0.5 to be a carrier (i.e. one of the grandparents was an obligate carrier) and 35 <span class="yellow">calves</span> out of these were diagnosed as affected. Since it is expected that about 1/2 to 1/3 of the affected <span class="yellow">calves</span> were recorded, this result is very close to the expected 1:7 ratio of affected to unaffected <span class="yellow">calves</span>. Moreover, these findings are concordant with the historical description of the arachnomelia syndrome in Simmental [2] and the analyses of cases in Brown Swiss [5]. Finally, when applying linkage analyses using microsatellite markers, evaluations with a model assuming recessive autosomal inheritance gave the highest lod scores (Buitkamp et al., in preparation).<br><br>Allelic frequency of carriers in the present Simmental <span class="yellow">cow</span> population
Since the arachnomelia syndrome-allele was passed to the current population through two parental lines (REXON and EGEL) and the main carriers are known, it is possible to estimate the frequency of the disease allele by an allele-counting method [10]. The allelic frequency was calculated for all <span class="yellow">cows</span> from the breeding population who were alive in June 2007. In 10.4 percent of the pedigrees of 540,725 <span class="yellow">cows</span> an identified carrier was found and the probability that individual <span class="yellow">cows</span> were carrier of the arachnomelia syndrome-allele was calculated. E.g. in 14,740 and 41,032 cases a known carrier appeared as sire and grandsire, respectively. In these cases the probability of transmitting the allele is 50 and 25 percent, respectively, if no further carrier is present in the two generation pedigree. The averaged rate of the arachnomelia syndrome carriers based on known carriers over all <span class="yellow">cows</span> alive in Bavarian Simmental was 3.32 percent.
Using this approach, the frequency of carriers was calculated for each year (always based on the actual datasets from August 2008) from 2003 to 2008 (Figure 1). The calculations were done twice, considering all known carriers together, and also by using only ROMEL as a carrier to show the numeric contribution of his progeny (Figure 1). For these analyses, the sires that are designated to be non-carriers by the number of risk pairings without having a case or the indirect gene test are set as non-carrier. Therefore, these frequencies are slightly lower than the initial frequency estimate of 3.32 percent.<br><br>
Conclusion
The cases of malformed Simmental <span class="yellow">calves</span> presented here showed the same morphology described in the arachnomelia syndrome in Brown Swiss [e.g. [3]], even though there is a certain morphological variation from mild to severe malformations. The main findings, brachygnathia inferior and convex frontal bone of the face, deformation of vertebrae, and dysplasia of the limbs, namely the diaphyses of metatarsus and -carpus and the fetlocks, can best be explained by irregularly developed bone structure at the corresponding locations.
Without pathological examination it is difficult to distinguish the arachnomelia syndrome from other malformations of the limbs. Therefore, low numbers of cases in Simmental probably passed unrecognized before 2005. In that year the allelic frequency of the disease in the <span class="yellow">cow</span> population increased sharply because some sires that had been carriers of the mutation had become very popular 2–4 years before.
The identification of a common ancestor, the results from the experimental matings and the analyses of numbers of cases from risk matings strongly support the hypothesis of an autosomal recessively inherited disease. Furthermore, this assumption is concordant with the historical description of the syndrome in Simmental and Brown Swiss. The allelic frequency of the arachnomelia syndrome in the current population is well above 3 percent and a substantial number of progeny from known carriers with superior genetic merit shall be used as sires during the next years. Therefore, a control system has to be established and the arachnomelia syndrome-gene should be mapped as a prerequisite for the development of an indirect gene test for carrier identification. The availability of pathologically well characterized cases from the field and from the ET-generated full-sib families will be an excellent material for a genetic mapping procedure.<br><br>Methods
Recording system for congenital malformations
A system for monitoring inherited congenital malformations in Bavarian <span class="blue">cattle</span> populations was established by the Institute for Animal Breeding of the Bavarian State Research Centre for Agriculture (ITZ) in cooperation with the Bavarian milk recording organization (LKV) [11]. In short, a questionnaire was developed for detailed recording of malformed <span class="yellow">calves</span>. The malformation was described according to its location (e.g. head, legs) and its characteristics (e.g. hernia). The standardized data were stored in a database at the LKV, that is evaluated monthly for a potential genetic background of malformations.
Sires that fit into the pedigree (progeny of REXON or EGEL) with at least one affected <span class="yellow">calf</span> with confirmed paternity were defined as obligate carriers and marked in the breeding information system [7]. In cases without connection to the pedigree and only one recorded <span class="yellow">calf</span> the number of "risk pairings" (matings to <span class="yellow">cows</span> where at least one parent is a known carrier, enabling the calculation of the probability for the occurrence of cases) was calculated. When the probability that a case occurs was above 99% for the sire in question the case was considered to be a phenocopy. The number of <span class="yellow">calves</span> affected by the arachnomelia syndrome and their parentage is routinely published [8].<br><br>Pathological examinations
Pathological examinations followed standard procedures. <span class="yellow">Calves</span> were photographed and size and weight measurements were recorded. Tissue specimens from the condyle (epiphysis) and from the diaphysis of the femur were collected for histological examination. Specimens were fixed in 10% formalin and kept in a decalcifying solution (Ossafixonafor) for 24 hours. Thereafter, specimens were processed in an automated embedding system, sectioned at 4–6 microns and finally stained with haematoxyline and eosin.<br><br>Experimental matings and embryo transfer
Known carriers of the arachnomelia syndrome (seven <span class="yellow">cows</span> that had produced at least one affected <span class="yellow">calf</span>) were brought to the facilities of the ITZ for embryo transfer (Table 1). Late morulae and blastocysts collected on day 7 (day 0 = estrus) from superovulated donor <span class="yellow">cows</span> were nonsurgically transferred to heifers [12].<br><br>Mode of inheritance and allele frequency
The pedigree of all cases was constructed from the pedigree that is used for the joint breeding evaluation of Germany and Austria. The graphical presentation of the pedigree was performed with the Pedigraph TM software [13]. The allelic frequency of the AS mutation in the current <span class="yellow">cow</span> population was estimated from ancestors with known genotypes following the allele-counting method [10]. For this reason two generation pedigrees of herd book <span class="yellow">cows</span> in Bavarian Simmental were analyzed for obligate carriers. We considered all <span class="yellow">cows</span> that were alive in June 2007 and included in the herd book. All animals were bred by the use of artificial insemination.<br><br>Statistical analyses
The non parametric Mann-Whitney-Test was performed using SPSS Version 14.0, the Chi-square test was performed using R 2.4.0 [14].<br><br>
