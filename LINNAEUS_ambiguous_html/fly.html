Abstract
A modifying influence of ortho-cresol (o-cresol) on the carcinogenic effect of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) with combined oral administration to CC57Br <span class="yellow">mice</span> had been found. During simultaneous administration of o-cresol (1 mg) and BaP (1 mg), the incidence of tumors, the multiplicity of tumors, and the degree of malignancy all increased, but the latency was shortened. When o-cresol was administered before or after BaP (in identical doses), the carcinogenic effect was weakened. When o-cresol (10 mg) and BaP (5 mg) were administered simultaneously, the incidence of malignant tumors was similar to controls receiving BaP only (13.8%), indicating inhibition of carcinogenesis.<br><br><br><br>

Both enhancing or weakening effects have been seen (1-12). In some experiments ubiquitious environmental carcinogenic and toxic chemical pollutants were used (13-17). <br><br> The stimulating effect of phenol, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide upon BaP's blastogenic action on the respiratory tract and phenol on the digestive tract (forestomach) have been reported (12-18). We have established the relationship between the doses of carcinogenic and toxic agents and their modifying effects (17,18). The maximal enhancing effect was observed after BaP (2.5 mg) and NO2 (0.87 mg/m3) were exposed to <span class="yellow">rat</span> respiratory tract. The effect weakened with decreasing dose. At concentrations at the MPC level (MPC BaP, 1 ng/m3, MPC NO2, 0.04 mg/m3) no effect was seen. Phenol at 1 mg orally to CC57Br <span class="yellow">mice</span> enhanced the BaP (1 mg) effect, but no effect was seen at 0.02 mg. Phenolic compounds showed either enhancing or inhibiting effects on carcinogenesis depending on their chemical structure (16,18-25). <br><br> This report presents the results of combined oral administration of BaP and artho-cresol (o-cresol) in <span class="yellow">mice</span>, <br><br> 'Ukrainian State Medical Center for Environmental Health, Kiev, Ukraine. <br><br> Address reprint requests to N.

Animals were divided in 15 groups. This experiment included three types of sequential combinations for the introduction of compounds: a) simultaneous BaP and o-cresol administration; b) BaP after o-cresol (stage 1); and c) BaP before o-cresol (stage 2). Appropriate controls were included (Table 1). <br><br> The chemicals were administered twice per week (for a total of 10, 20, and 40 doses) using a syringe and a needle with a soldered olive on its tip. BaP (1 or 5 mg) or o-cresol (0.02, 1, or 10 mg) was placed in triethylene glycol (TEG) and administered as 0.1-mL water solutions. The evaluation of o-cresol's modifying effect on the incidence of tumors, especially malignant tumors, the tumor latency period (tl), and the average time (ta) of the appearance of tumors, as well as the multiplicity index, M (the average number of tumors per animal for tumor-bearing animals) was recorded. Because the M could be identified at the initial stage of carcinogenesis by the third month after the beginning of the trial when neoplasms began to emerge, moribund animals were killed by ether inhalation if they did not die spontaneously. <br><br> The experiments with large chemical doses (BaP, 5 mg; o-cresol, 10 mg) lasted for 30 weeks. Some animals were killed after the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 10th procedures for the <br><br> YANYSHEVA ET AL. <br><br> evaluation of initial stages of carcinogenesis; others were killed at 26 and 30 weeks. The stomachs were distended with formalin solution and the mucosa examined macroscopically. All tumors > 1 mm in diameter were recorded. Organs and tissues were fised in 10% neutral formalin solution, embedded in paraffin and routine histological slides prepared. Microscopic data were processed according to Mostkovoy (30). <br><br> Results <br><br> The data from this study demonstrate the modifying influence of o-cresol on BaP-induced carcinogenesis with combined oral exposure. The combined exposure and BaP alone caused benign and malignant epithelial tumors of the forestomach. The benign neoplasms were papillomas, and the malignant neoplasms were invasive carcinomas. <br><br> The combined administration of BaP and o-cresol showed different results depending on doses and sequential combinations of both chemicals. As shown in Table 2, the simultaneous administration of BaP (1 mg) and o-cresol (1 mg) affected all parameters of carcinogenesis that were measured. This included a significant increase in the incidence of tumors, shortening of the time to the appearance of the first tumor, and the mean time of tumor <br><br> development as compared to animals that received 1 mg of BaP alone and had tumors. One hundred percent of the <span class="yellow">mice</span> that received 5 mg of BaP alone had tumors. <br><br> Shortening of the time to appearance of malignant tumors was also observed: the <span class="yellow">mice</span> with forestomach cancer died between 23 and 26.2 weeks after the beginning of experiment, but the controls survived to 58.5 weeks. Muliple small metastases in the lungs and mediastinum were found in 42.8% of <span class="yellow">mice</span>, which signifies a high degree of malignancy. <br><br> o-Cresol at 0.02 mg did not modify carcinogenesis in comparison to the control. o-Cresol administration before or after BaP did not modify tumor incidence or the multiplicity index as compared to control, but the latency period was longer (Table 2). When o-cresol was administered after BaP (stage 2), there was an absence of malignant tumors. <br><br> Besides the quantitative aspects, other peculiarities of carcinogenesis in <span class="yellow">mice</span> simultaneously administered BaP and o-cresol should be noted. The combined chemical administration resulted in diffuse verrucosa vegetations over the forestomach surface, especially near the greater curvature. Highly aggressive malignant neoplasms developed earlier with more metastases as compared to control. <br><br> Many <span class="yellow">mice</span> were emaciated, and the tumors could be <br><br> Table 1.

At autopsy, enlargement of the stomach with tuberculous white superficial vegetations were observed. The forestomach and glandular part of the stomach was often obliterated by tumor masses. <br><br> The stomach was often adhered to the pancreas, liver, and mesentery. Hemmorrhage and inflammation were found in tumors foci. When o-cresol was introduced before BaP, the tumors were more frequently found closer to the small curvature of the stomach between the forestomach and esophageal entrance. Over the large curvature less prominent mucosal folds were observed. Microscopically, a decrease in mucosa papillae, epithelial atrophy (one to two cullular layers), decreased keratonization, and nuclear pycnosis were observed. With the simultaneous administration of large doses of o-cresol and BaP, the final carcinogenic effect (30 weeks after the first dose) was similar to BaP alone but differences were observed at the earlier stages (after the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 10th exposures). <br><br> In the BaP control, multiple forestomach epithelial proliferative and hyperplastic changes were found after the third dose. Multiple papillomas occurred (9-15 in each <span class="yellow">mouse</span>). The stomach's mucosal folds appeared thickened diffusely, then papillomas appeared and finally merged together. <br><br> Approximately half of the tumors were malignant. The neoplasms filled almost the whole forestomach cavity and infiltrated the wall with tuberculous vegetations, which were visible on the serosal surface. Thmor infiltration in the liver, pancreas, and wide dissemination of peritoneum were also observed. In <span class="yellow">mice</span> simultaneously administered BaP and o-cresol, the proliferative alterations of forestomach epithelium were seen after the third dose. However, they occurred as the single foci at damaged mucosa and even in the later stages were not diffuse. Adjacent to the hyperplastic foci, the mucosa was atrophied with decreased keratonization. The epithelial cells also showed cytoplasm coagulation and nuclear pycnosis. Edema, inflammation of the mucosa, submucosa microabscesses, and erosion were seen. There were fewer papillomas per <span class="yellow">mouse</span> (four to eight in each <span class="yellow">mouse</span>) than in the control group. Even in the late stages the papillomas were isolated and elevated on the atrophied mucosal folds. <br><br> In the final experiment the papillomas prevailed as compared to the previous experiments. Only 4 out of 29 <span class="yellow">mice</span> (13.8%) developed malignant tumors. Neoplasms were smaller and appeared as single verrucosa vegetations 5-10 mm in diameter. Thus, the toxic dose of o-cresol inhibits the carcinogenic process of induced forestomach tumors by decreasing multiplicity, frequency, and percentage of malignant tumors. <br><br> Discussion <br><br> Our results and the literature suggest a hypothesis on modifying carcinogenesis mechanisms. The primary effect of the toxic agents, including carcinogenic agents, may relate to cellular membrane damage with the subsequent increased permeability (31-35), which may be the mechanism of the o-cresol. <br><br> With simultaneous introduction of o-cresol at low toxic doses and BaP there may be increased carcinogen penetration to the target cells. In addition, membrane damage may alter other cellular systems responsible for energy and xenobiotic detoxication. Damage of these processes may activate free-radical reactions, glycolysis, or alter carcinogenic metabolism, which promotes the oncogenic effect. The o-cresol effect on these systems was confirmed by our previous investigations on cytochrome P450, ferrosulfuric nonhemic proteins, and semiquinon radical content affected by the combined action of BaP and o-cresol (36). <br><br> Another effect was obtained with BaP exposure after o-cresol. The atrophic alterations in the stomach induced by 2.5 months of o-cresol administration might decrease the natural conditions of retention (muscosal folds, frontier torn), and thus shorten the contact of BaP with the forestomach. In our opinion, this explains the decreased carcinogenic effect seen after o-cresol exposure. <br><br> Considering the toxic effect of o-cresol at low toxic doses (1 mg) after BaP and the effect of a super toxic dose (10 mg) simultaneously with BaP administration, it is possible that the inhibition of carcinogenesis in both trials was related to the toxic effects of o-cresol. Cytotoxicity may not only hamper tumor growth, but also promote the regression of inducible and spontaneous neoplasms (37-39). There is also a possibility that BaP damages metabolic systems and decreases resistance to carcinogenesis. <br><br> Conclusions <br><br> The data obtained demonstrate that simultaneous administration of BaP modifies the induced carcinogenesis depending on the dose and the sequence of administration. Administered with BaP (1 mg), a low toxic o-cresol dose (about minimally effective) produces an enhanced cocarcinogenic effect reflected in the incidence, frequency, multiplicity, and degree of malignancy of forestomach tumors. <br><br> o-Cresol administration at low toxic doses before or after BaP at the same dose level (1 mg) and its administration at super toxic doses (10 mg) with the BaP optimal dose (5 mg) may inhibit carcinogenesis. Simultaneous introduction of a noneffective o-cresol dose (0.02 mg) with the BaP (1 mg) does not change its carcinogenic activity. Controlling both chemicals in the environment is the most effective measure of preventing potential risk and is undoubtedly of paramount significance. <br><br> REFERENCES <br><br> 1.

Abstract
Background
Recent studies have indicated an increased risk of venous thrombosis after air travel. Nevertheless, questions on the magnitude of risk, the underlying mechanism, and modifying factors remain unanswered.<br><br>Methods and Findings
We studied the effect of various modes and duration of travel on the risk of venous thrombosis in a large ongoing case-control study on risk factors for venous thrombosis in an unselected population (MEGA study). We also assessed the combined effect of travel and prothrombotic mutations, body mass index, height, and oral contraceptive use.
Since March 1999, consecutive <span class="yellow">patients</span> younger than 70 y with a first venous thrombosis have been invited to participate in the study, with their partners serving as matched control individuals. Information has been collected on acquired and genetic risk factors for venous thrombosis. Of 1,906 <span class="yellow">patients</span>, 233 had traveled for more than 4 h in the 8 wk preceding the event. Traveling in general was found to increase the risk of venous thrombosis 2-fold (odds ratio [OR] 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5–3.0). The risk of flying was similar to the risks of traveling by car, bus, or train. The risk was highest in the first week after traveling. Travel by car, bus, or train led to a high relative risk of thrombosis in individuals with factor V Leiden (OR 8.1; 95% CI 2.7–24.7), in those who had a body mass index of more than 30 kg/m2 (OR 9.9; 95% CI 3.6–27.6), in those who were more than 1.90 m tall (OR 4.7; 95% CI 1.4–15.4), and in those who used oral contraceptives (estimated OR > 20). For air travel these synergistic findings were more apparent, while <span class="yellow">people</span> shorter than 1.60 m had an increased risk of thrombosis after air travel (OR 4.9; 95% CI 0.9–25.6) as well.<br><br>Conclusions
The risk of venous thrombosis after travel is moderately increased for all modes of travel. Subgroups exist in which the risk is highly increased.<br><br>
Background.
Recently there has been increasing concern that blood clots (thromboses) in the leg or lungs occur with greater frequency after air travel. Several theories have been put forward to explain why this increase might happen, including the fact that air passengers tend to not move around much, or possibly that reduced amounts of oxygen in the blood make the blood more likely to clot. Understanding what causes such clots is important as it would help us come up with suggestions of ways to prevent them.<br><br>Why Was This Study Done?
It is not possible to test in a controlled trial whether travel causes an increase in blood clots, so the next best way of studying this problem is to do a case-control study, in which <span class="yellow">people</span> with blood clots (cases) are compared with similar <span class="yellow">people</span> who don't have a blood clot (controls—in this case, the partners of the cases), and the differences in a number of contributing factors are assessed.<br><br>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
Since 1999, the MEGA (Multiple Environmental and Genetic Assessment of Risk Factors for Venous Thrombosis) study has aimed to identify all <span class="yellow">people</span> in an area of the Netherlands who develop a blood clot for the first time, by seeking out <span class="yellow">people</span> who receive treatment for blood clots. At the time of this report, 1,906 <span class="yellow">people</span> with clots had been found; of these, 233 had traveled for more than four hours in the eight weeks preceding the event. Traveling in general was found to increase the risk of clots two-fold, and the risk was highest in the week after traveling. The risk of flying was similar to the risk of traveling by car, bus, or train, and was highest in the first week after traveling. Certain other factors increased the risk of a blood clot even more, such as having a particular mutation (known as factor V Leiden) in a gene involved in blood clotting, having a body mass index of more than 30 kg/m2 (over 30 kg/m2 is defined as being obese), being more than 1.90 meters tall, and using oral contraceptives. All these factors made the risk of clots especially after air travel worse; in addition, <span class="yellow">people</span> shorter than 1.60 meters also had an increased risk of thrombosis after air travel. However, it should be borne in mind that the number of cases in each of these various groups was quite small, and the overall risk of getting a thrombosis is still low.<br><br>What Do These Findings Mean?
Since the risks of thrombosis are increased for all types of long travel, it seems that the main factor causing the thrombosis is immobility. However, since the risk is even higher for air travel, the relative lack of oxygen may also play a part. One interesting aspect of this study is that the researchers used partners as controls; in order to be sure that doing this did not make the results invalid, the researchers had to carefully adjust for differences between the cases and controls, such as the fact that partners were generally of the opposite sex. In a related Perspective (DOI: 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030300), Kenneth Rothman discusses the study further.<br><br>Additional Information.

Introduction
Interest in the role of air travel in the pathogenesis of venous thrombosis has heightened in the past 5 y [1–5]. Venous thrombosis was first linked to air travel in 1954 [6], and as air travel has become more and more common, many case reports and case series have been published since. Several clinical studies have shown an association between air travel and the risk of venous thrombosis. In a series of individuals who died suddenly at Heathrow Airport, death occurred far more often in the arrival than in the departure area [7]. Two similar studies described a “dose-response” relation: the risk of pulmonary embolism in air travelers increased with the distance traveled [5,8]. A number of case-control studies, however, have shown conflicting results [9–11]. More recently, a 2-fold increased risk in <span class="yellow">patients</span> who had traveled by air was described in a case-control study among 210 <span class="yellow">patients</span> and 210 controls [3]. A case-crossover study based on record linking in Australia described a 4-fold increased risk of venous thrombosis in the first 2 wk after a long-haul flight [1]. In terms of absolute risk, two studies found similar results: one performed in New Zealand found a frequency of 1% of venous thrombosis in 878 individuals who had traveled by air for at least 10 h [2], and a German study found venous thrombotic events in 2.8% of 964 individuals who had traveled for more than 8 h in an airplane, as compared to 1% in 1,213 controls [4]. The events in both studies were mostly asymptomatic.
The available evidence suggests that the overall risk of venous thrombosis is moderately increased after air travel. Nevertheless, many questions remain unanswered: the exact underlying mechanism is still unknown, and, related to this, it is not clear whether the risk is increased after air travel only or after long-distance travel in general. Furthermore, the effect of the combination of other risk factors for venous thrombosis and travel has not yet been systematically studied, with the exception of a study by Martinelli et al., who found an additionally increased risk in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with thrombophilia and <span class="yellow">patients</span> who used oral contraceptives [3].
The Multiple Environmental and Genetic Assessment (MEGA) study of risk factors for venous thrombosis is a large ongoing case-control study aimed at assessing the combined effect of genetic and acquired risk factors for venous thrombosis. Cases and control individuals are questioned about—among many other items—travel that occurred shortly before the event. This provides an opportunity to assess the effect of travel on the risk of thrombosis in an unselected population, as well as the effect of the combination of travel with several other risk factors for thrombosis.<br><br>Methods
Study Design
Since March 1999, consecutive <span class="yellow">patients</span> younger than 70 y with a first deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) have been identified at six regional anticoagulation clinics in the Netherlands. Anticoagulant clinics monitor the anticoagulant therapy of all <span class="yellow">patients</span> in a well-defined geographical area, allowing us to identify consecutive and unselected <span class="yellow">patients</span> with thrombosis. <span class="yellow">Patients</span> who were unable to fill in the questionnaire (because of language or severe psychiatric problems), as well as those who died soon after the venous thrombosis or who were in the end stage of a disease and for that reason did not participate, were not included. All others were considered eligible. Partners of these <span class="yellow">patients</span> were invited as control individuals, and the same exclusion criteria were applied.
All <span class="yellow">participants</span> filled in a detailed standardized questionnaire on general demographic and anthropomorphic characteristics, as well as risk factors for venous thrombosis. The questionnaire was sent to all <span class="yellow">participants</span> within a few weeks after the event and covered the period of 1 y prior to the date of the thrombotic event (index date). When the <span class="yellow">participant</span> was unable to fill in the questionnaire we asked questions by phone, using a standardized mini-questionnaire. Three months after the <span class="yellow">patients</span> had discontinued their oral anticoagulant therapy, they were invited with their partners to the anticoagulation clinic for a blood sample. In those <span class="yellow">patients</span> who continued to take oral anticoagulant therapy for more than 1 y after the event, blood was drawn during therapy. If <span class="yellow">participants</span> were unable to come to the clinic, a buccal swab was sent by mail to replace the blood sample for DNA extraction.
The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Leiden University Medical Center. Written informed consent was obtained from all <span class="yellow">participants</span> [12].<br><br>Validation Study of Thrombosis Diagnosis
Discharge letters or diagnostic reports of the venous thrombotic event were obtained for a sample of 742 <span class="yellow">patients</span> who had their first thrombosis between March 1999 and March 2000. The diagnostic management of the <span class="yellow">patients</span> was compared to the diagnostic procedure as described in the Dutch consensus [13]. Diagnosis of clinically suspected DVT of the leg is based on a clinical score, serial compression ultrasonography, and D-dimer assay. Objective testing of clinically suspected pulmonary embolism is based on perfusion and ventilation scintigraphy, ultrasonography of the leg veins, pulmonary angiography, or helical computed tomography. Out of 395 <span class="yellow">patients</span> with DVT of the leg, 384 (97%) were objectively diagnosed, while out of 347 <span class="yellow">patients</span> with PE, 271 (78%) were confirmed with objective testing as certainly having PE. Since the diagnosis appears to be made by objective methods in virtually all cases of DVT, while being more ambiguous for PE, we also analyzed these two manifestations of venous thrombosis separately.<br><br>Current Analysis
For the current analysis we were interested in the effects of travel, and its combined effect with other common risk factors for venous thrombosis. <span class="yellow">Patients</span> with a solitary arm thrombosis were excluded from this analysis. Of 3,902 eligible cases, diagnosed up to May 2002, 656 did not participate for various reasons (such as not willing or not reachable), leading to a response of 83%. A further 3% responded only to the mini-questionnaire, taken by phone, which did not contain questions about travel. Of the remaining 3,111 cases, 78% had a partner, 77% of whom were willing to participate, which left 1,867 couples. Additionally, 229 partners were identified for whom the corresponding <span class="yellow">patient</span> originally participated but was later found not to be eligible (aged over 70 y, or not a first thrombotic event). These control individuals were matched on sex and 5-y age groups to one of the 557 <span class="yellow">patients</span> whose partner did not want to participate, so an extra 229 pairs were included, making a total of 4,192 <span class="yellow">participants</span> (2,096 pairs). As part of the general questionnaire, questions had been asked about whether or not respondents had traveled for more than 4 h in the 3 mo before the index date, about the travel date, and about mode and duration of travel. We assessed the occurrence of thrombosis in relation to the period of time that had passed since traveling. Travel was defined in the analysis as at least one journey with a duration of at least four uninterrupted hours during the 8-wk period before the event. During the analysis it appeared that some individuals had provided dates of travel after the event instead of before. As there was only one opportunity to fill in such a date, we had no information about the period before the event. This was the case in 88 cases and 146 controls. We excluded these individuals and their partners, which left 3,812 <span class="yellow">participants</span> (1,906 pairs) for the analysis.
Because we selected the partners of the cases as control individuals, and because it turned out, as expected, that couples tend to travel together, we performed a conditional logistic regression analysis to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for the relation between travel and venous thrombosis. This method fully takes this matching into account, and leads to unbiased estimates, with adjustment for all factors in which cases and controls tend to be similar, e.g., socioeconomic class [14]. Details of this method can be found in Protocol S1. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived from the model.
We assessed the combined effect of traveling and the following risk factors for thrombosis: factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin G20210A mutation, body mass index (BMI, as kg/m2), and height. We were also interested in the combined effect of oral contraceptive use and travel. However, as the control individuals were nearly always of the opposite sex (partners of the cases were recruited as controls), it was not possible to perform a matched analysis for the combination of oral contraceptive use and travel. Therefore, we performed a case-only analysis [15]. This method allows one to examine the association between two exposures among case individuals only. ORs are interpreted as a synergy index (SI) on a multiplicative scale, with independence assumed between the exposures. As this analysis depends only on cases, it was possible to perform it in all consecutive cases, therefore also including those without a partner.<br><br>Laboratory Measurements
Blood was collected from the antecubital vein into vacuum tubes containing 0.106 mol/l trisodium citrate. High molecular weight DNA was isolated from leukocytes using a standard salting-out procedure [16] and stored at −20 °C. When a blood sample was not available, DNA was extracted from buccal swabs. Three large <span class="yellow">cotton</span> swabs in a total of 6 ml of SDS–proteinase K solution (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 0.5% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K) were obtained. Upon arrival, the proteinase K concentration was raised to 0.2 mg/ml, and the sample was incubated for 2 h at 65 °C. Subsequently, the solute was recovered by centrifugation. Potassium acetate was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 1.6 M. After 15 min incubation on ice, proteins were removed using chloroform/isomylalcohol (24:1) treatment. The DNA in the water phase was subsequently ethanol precipitated. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl and 10 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), and frozen at −20 °C until further analysis. The factor V Leiden mutation (G1691A) and the prothrombin mutation (G20210A) were simultaneously detected by duplex polymerase chain reaction [17,18]. The technician was blinded concerning the origin of the sample, i.e., whether it was from a <span class="yellow">patient</span> or from a control individual.<br><br>
Results
Venous Thrombosis in Relation to Travel
Table 1 shows general characteristics of the 1,906 <span class="yellow">patients</span>. They ranged in age from 18 to 69 y (median 50.4 y); 51% were <span class="yellow">men</span>. Diagnosis was DVT in 57% of the cases, PE in 32%, and both in 11%. As partners of the cases were included as control individuals, the sex distribution of the control individuals was the opposite; the age distribution differed only trivially.
Of the <span class="yellow">patients</span>, 233 individuals (12%) had traveled for at least 4 h by air, bus, car, or train within the 8 wk preceding the index date, as compared to 182 of the control individuals (9.5%). As the cases and control individuals were selected as couples, many pairs (135) had traveled together and were uninformative: as a consequence, 145 pairs in which either the <span class="yellow">patient</span> (98) or the control (47) had traveled could be used for the matched analysis (Table 2). This analysis showed a 2-fold increased risk of venous thrombosis for all modes of travel combined (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.5–3.0) compared to not traveling. For air travel alone, 49 individuals (31 cases and 18 controls) had traveled without their partner, and the analysis yielded an OR of 1.7 (95% CI 1.0–3.1). For the other modes of travel (car, bus, and train) the relative risks were essentially similar to each other and to that of air travel (Table 2).
The risk of venous thrombosis was not clearly related to increased duration of travel (Table 2). Of the 233 events that occurred within 8 wk after traveling, 68 (29%) were diagnosed in the first week, after which the incidence gradually decreased (Figure 1).<br><br>The Effect of Other Risk Factors Combined with Travel
Prothrombotic mutations.
Information on the factor V Leiden mutation and prothrombin G20210A genotype was available for 1,713 <span class="yellow">patients</span> (90%) and for 1,629 of the control individuals (85%). Factor V Leiden was present in 259 cases (14%) and 84 control individuals (4%) (OR 3.1; 95% CI 2.4–4.1).
The risk of venous thrombosis was 8-fold increased in <span class="yellow">people</span> with factor V Leiden who had traveled by bus, car, or train (modes combined) as compared to noncarriers who did not travel (OR 8.1; 95% CI 2.7–24.7). For the combined effect of air travel and factor V Leiden, the risk seemed even slightly higher (OR 13.6; 95% CI 2.9–64.2).
The prothrombin G20210A mutation was found in 83 cases (4%) and in 29 control individuals (2%) (OR 2.7; 95% CI 1.7–4.2). The risk in individuals with this mutation who had traveled was difficult to interpret because of the small numbers but appeared not to increase more than additively (Table 3).<br><br>BMI.
The effect of BMI was studied by dividing individuals into three categories with the following BMI values: <25, 25–30, and >30 kg/m2 [19]. A BMI of 25–30 kg/m2 was associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis (OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.2–1.7), and the risk was slightly higher in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or more (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.4–2.1).
The combined effect of a higher BMI and travel was the sum of the individual risks (Table 3), with the exception of <span class="yellow">people</span> with a BMI of more than 30 kg/m2 who traveled by car, bus, or train, for whom the risk was 10-fold increased (OR 9.9; 95% CI 3.6–27.6). This increase in risk was not found in <span class="yellow">people</span> who traveled by air.<br><br>Height.
Particularly short or tall <span class="yellow">people</span> may be subjected during travel to even more unnatural sitting positions than individuals with average height. Therefore, we assessed the effect of extremes of heights in combination with travel on the risk of venous thrombosis by comparing short (less than 1.60 m) and tall individuals (more than 1.90 m) with <span class="yellow">people</span> of average height (1.60–1.90 m). Compared to <span class="yellow">people</span> of average height, the risk of venous thrombosis was lower for short <span class="yellow">people</span> (OR 0.7; 95% CI 0.5–0.9) and did not differ for very tall individuals (OR 0.9; 95% CI 0.7–1.1). The risk was found to be increased in <span class="yellow">people</span> of more than 1.90 m who traveled (OR 4.7; 95% CI 1.4–15.4 for travel by car, bus, or train; OR 6.8; 95% CI 0.8–60.6 for air travel) compared to non-traveling <span class="yellow">people</span> of average height. Interestingly, the risk of venous thrombosis was also increased in short <span class="yellow">people</span> but only after air travel (OR 4.9; 95% CI 0.9–25.6), not after other modes of travel (OR 1.0; 95% CI 0.3–2.8, all relative to non-traveling <span class="yellow">people</span> of average height).<br><br>Oral contraception.
To study the association between oral contraceptive use, travel, and the risk of venous thrombosis, we performed a case-only analysis in all female <span class="yellow">patients</span> who were less than 50 y of age. As we needed only cases, it was also possible to include <span class="yellow">women</span> without a partner for this analysis, which led to a total of 1,025 <span class="yellow">women</span> aged under 50. Non-users who did not travel were used as the reference group. The case-only estimate of the SI for <span class="yellow">women</span> who traveled by car, bus, or train was 2.4 (95% CI 1.5–3.7). This indicates that the OR for the combination of travel and oral contraceptive use is 2.4 times the product of the separate ORs. As oral contraceptive use generally increases the risk of venous thrombosis about 4-fold [20], the combination with travel by car, bus, or train would lead to an estimated OR of about 20 (4 × 2 × 2.4). A clearly stronger interaction of travel by air with oral contraceptive use was found: the case-only estimate of the SI was 4.9 (95% CI 2.1– 11.4), which would result in an OR of about 40 (4 × 2 × 4.9).<br><br>
Effect of Risk Factors in DVT <span class="yellow">Patients</span> Only
Of the 1,906 cases, 1,082 were diagnosed with DVT. As the diagnosis was more unambiguous in these <span class="yellow">patients</span> (97% objectively diagnosed as compared to 78% of the PE <span class="yellow">patients</span>), we repeated the analysis in these <span class="yellow">patients</span> only.
In this analysis, the overall effect of travel on the risk of DVT was equal to the effect on all venous thrombosis (DVT and PE combined). However, here we found a stronger risk for travel by air (OR 3.0; 95% CI 1.3–7.1) then for travel by car, bus, or train (OR 1.9; 95% CI 1.1–3.2) (Table 4). Also, the analysis of the combination of other risk factors with travel resulted in more clear-cut effects, despite the smaller number of cases: the risk of DVT was still clearly synergistically increased in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with factor V Leiden who traveled, whereas the prothrombin G20210A mutation did not further increase the risk of travel (Table 4). Furthermore, a BMI of more than 30 kg/m2 in combination with travel yielded high ORs for DVT both in <span class="yellow">people</span> who traveled by car, bus, or train and in those who flew. Being more than 1.90 m tall in combination with travel resulted in higher ORs for DVT; the risk for short <span class="yellow">people</span> was more increased after travel by air (OR 6.8; 95% CI 1.1–43.5) (Table 4). The effect of oral contraceptive use in combination with travel by car, bus, or train on the risk of DVT was studied in 589 <span class="yellow">women</span> and was somewhat lower than the effect on the risk of all venous thrombosis (SI 1.9; 95% CI 0.9–4.2). In those who traveled by air it was also a bit lower (SI 3.4; 95% CI 1.3–8.8), but still indicative of a strong synergistic effect.<br><br>
Discussion
In this population-based case-control study, long-distance traveling increased the risk of venous thrombosis 2-fold. Travel by air increased the risk to the same extent as travel by car, bus, or train. The risk was highest in the first week after traveling. As venous thrombosis is a disease in which many factors (genetic and acquired) interact [21], we identified groups with additional risk factors in which the risk was further increased. This was the case for individuals with factor V Leiden, obese <span class="yellow">people</span> (BMI > 30 kg/m2), and short (only for travel by air) and tall <span class="yellow">people</span>, as well as for <span class="yellow">women</span> using oral contraceptives. Some of these synergistic effects were more apparent for air travel.
Although the studies that have been published so far have not yielded entirely consistent results, those that did report an increased risk of venous thrombosis in air travelers showed similar risk estimates of a 2- to 3-fold increased risk (even in one with asymptomatic events only [4]). The occurrence of venous thrombosis was highest in the first week after travel, and slowly declined afterwards, a pattern that was also described in a recent record-linking study from Australia [1], supporting a causal relation.
As a possible mechanism for an extra risk in travelers who <span class="red">fly</span>, an effect of hypobaric hypoxia on the coagulation system was postulated, which has already been studied a number of times, mainly in hypobaric chambers, with unclear results so far. Our study showed an increased risk in all types of travel, which suggests that the increased risk of flying is caused mainly by immobilization. Additionally, the risk is further increased in short and tall <span class="yellow">people</span>, who are likely to experience more immobilization and venous compression than other travelers. However, as some of our findings were more pronounced for air travel, we cannot exclude an additional effect of hypobaric hypoxia, possibly in risk groups only. This possibility is supported by a recent study of our group [22] in which we found that thrombin generation occurred in some healthy volunteers after flying for 8 h but happened to a far lesser extent after being immobilized for 8 h in a cinema. The high response in the fliers was associated with the presence of risk factors for thrombosis, i.e., oral contraceptive use, the factor V Leiden mutation, and the combination of the two. This finding indicates an effect of an additional factor in an airplane, such as hypobaric hypoxia, to which mainly individuals with risk factors respond.
None of the studies published so far have systematically studied the effect of traveling in combination with other risk factors, with the exception of the study by Martinelli et al. [3]. In an analysis of 210 <span class="yellow">patients</span>, they found a 16-fold increased risk for <span class="yellow">patients</span> who traveled by air and had some form of thrombophilia, as well as a 14-fold increased risk in <span class="yellow">women</span> who flew and used oral contraceptives, findings that confirm both the results of the present study and our finding of activated coagulation in individuals with risk factors after flying [22].
The finding that taller and shorter <span class="yellow">people</span> had an increased risk of venous thrombosis after traveling should be interpreted with some caution, as the numbers were small in these strata. On the other hand, it is biologically plausible: very tall <span class="yellow">people</span> are subjected to even more cramped seating than average-height individuals, and very short <span class="yellow">people</span>'s feet may not touch the floor, which would lead to extra compression of the popliteal veins. Interestingly, the increased risk for short <span class="yellow">people</span> was only found in <span class="yellow">people</span> who traveled by air. This may have to do with the fact that seats in cars are generally lower, and more individually adjustable, than those in airplanes.
As the diagnosis of DVT is usually more unambiguous than that of PE [23], as was the case in our study population as well, we repeated the analysis using only DVT as the outcome of interest (97% objectively diagnosed). In this analysis, despite using smaller numbers, most findings were either similar or appeared more evident, and inconsistencies that were found when using both DVT and PE as endpoints disappeared.
To our knowledge, this is the first large population-based case-control study in which the effect of travel on the risk of venous thrombosis has been studied. Because the control individuals were closely matched, being partners of the cases, and couples tend to travel together, only the cases and control individuals who had not traveled together could be used for the analysis. Also because of this design, the effect of sex and age could not be studied. It has to be noted, however, that for all other research questions on the effect of genetic and acquired risk factors on the risk of venous thrombosis, this design has no limitations and the close matching of cases and controls renders confounding by, for instance, lifestyle and socioeconomic class less likely than in previous unmatched studies (see also Protocol S1). Another advantage of this approach is the minimization of recall bias, as the cases and controls would generally fill in the questionnaire together.
Many questions are still left unanswered that necessitate more research. First of all, our study results apply only to <span class="yellow">people</span> younger than 70 y of age. Furthermore, it is likely that other characteristics exist that also increase the risk—<span class="yellow">person</span>-specific (e.g., other drug use), behavioral (e.g., use of sleeping pills or alcohol consumption), and flight-specific (e.g., class or seating)—that need to be identified. These further variables are part of our ongoing study as part of the World Health Organization Research Initiative into the Global Hazards of Travel (WRIGHT study). For those who have an increased risk, such as oral contraceptive users and individuals with factor V Leiden, prevention may be warranted. Prevention may vary from simple measures, such as exercises during the flight, to measures that carry a risk themselves, such as anticoagulants. Specific studies are needed to assess the efficacy of these measures and their risk–benefit ratio.
It can be concluded that the risk of venous thrombosis is 2-fold increased for all travelers and to the same extent for all modes of travel. In individuals who use oral contraceptives, are carriers of the factor V Leiden mutation, or are particularly tall, short, or obese, this risk is considerably higher, to such an extent that studies into the efficacy of prophylactic measures are required.<br><br>Supporting Information<br><br>
<h3>pmcA1634875</h3>Molecular polymorphism, differentiation and introgression in the period gene between <span class="yellow">Lutzomyia intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">Lutzomyia whitmani</span>
Abstract
Background
<span class="yellow">Lutzomyia intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">Lutzomyia whitmani</span> (Diptera: Psychodidae) are important and very closely related vector species of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Brazil, which are distinguishable by a few morphological differences. There is evidence of mitochondrial introgression between the two species but it is not clear whether gene flow also occurs in nuclear genes.<br><br>Results
We analyzed the molecular variation within the clock gene period (per) of these two species in five different localities in Eastern Brazil. AMOVA and Fst estimates showed no evidence for geographical differentiation within species. On the other hand, the values were highly significant for both analyses between species. The two species show no fixed differences and a higher number of shared polymorphisms compared to exclusive mutations. In addition, some haplotypes that are "typical" of one species were found in some individuals of the other species suggesting either the persistence of old polymorphisms or the occurrence of introgression. Two tests of gene flow, one based on linkage disequilibrium and a MCMC analysis based on coalescence, suggest that the two species might be exchanging alleles at the per locus.<br><br>Conclusion
Introgression might be occurring between <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> in period, a gene controlling behavioral rhythms in <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span>. This result raises the question of whether similar phenomena are occurring at other loci controlling important aspects of behavior and vectorial capacity.<br><br><br><br>Background
The Phlebotominae sand <span class="yellow">flies</span> <span class="yellow">Lutzomyia intermedia</span> Lutz & Neiva 1912 and <span class="yellow">Lutzomyia whitmani</span> Antunes & Coutinho 1912 are vectors of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Brazil. These are closely related species that can be only distinguished by a few morphological differences [1] and both show high anthropophily and reported natural infections with Leishmania in different regions of Brazil [2].
Despite their importance as vectors, only a handful of studies have been carried out in these two species using molecular techniques [3-6]. One of the most important findings from an epidemiological perspective is the evidence obtained for introgression between the two species using mitochondrial DNA [4]. This was particularly interesting because apparently, only lineages of <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> sympatric with <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> have been involved in cutaneous leishmaniasis transmission in the peridomestic environment [4], which suggests that genes controlling aspects of vectorial capacity could be passing from one species to the other. In fact, mitochondrial introgression has been reported in other sand <span class="red">fly</span> species [7,8] suggesting that might be a common phenomenon in these insect vectors. However, because mitochondrial genes can introgress relatively easily between closely related species [9], it becomes important to examine whether introgression can occur with nuclear genes.
The <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> period (per) gene homologue was isolated in sand <span class="yellow">flies</span> by Peixoto et al. [10]. This circadian clock gene was originally identified using mutagenesis by Konopka and Benzer [11], but is also known to control the differences in the "lovesong" rhythms between <span class="yellow">D. melanogaster</span> and <span class="yellow">D. simulans</span> [12], that are important to the sexual isolation between these two species [13-15]. In addition, per was implicated in the control of species-specific circadian mating rhythms in <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> and Bractocera, which might also constitute a reproductive isolation mechanism [16-18]. Thus per may possibly represent an example of a <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> speciation gene [19], and in fact it has been used as a molecular marker in a number of speciation and evolutionary studies, not only in <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> (reviewed in [20]) but also in other insects (e.g. [21]) including sand <span class="yellow">flies</span> [22-24].
Because per controls the circadian clock in different insects [25], it is almost certainly involved in the rhythms of activity and biting of sand <span class="yellow">flies</span> [26], which are very important to leishmaniasis transmission. In addition, per might be involved in reproductive isolation in sand <span class="yellow">flies</span>, via mating rhythms, or via their "lovesongs" [2,27]. per is thus a particularly interesting marker, among the few available, for an introgression analysis in <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span>. Evidence for introgression in per might suggest that gene flow between these two vector species is occurring at other genes controlling important aspects of behavior and vectorial capacity. It might also suggest that per does not have a strong role in their reproductive isolation. In the current study, we analyzed the molecular variation within the per gene of <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> in five different localities in Eastern Brazil.<br><br>Results
Polymorphism and divergence between <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span>
A total of 68 sequences from <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and 53 from <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> homologue to a fragment of the period gene were analyzed from populations of five localities in Eastern Brazil (Fig 1). The alignment of 72 variable sites is shown in Fig 2. Although most of the changes are either synonymous or occur within the 58 bp intron, non-synonymous substitutions are observed causing 9 amino acid differences among the sequences (Fig 2).
Table 1 shows the number of sequences of each population of the two species, the number of polymorphic sites (S) and the estimates of molecular polymorphism θ (based on the total number of mutations) and π. Table 1 also shows the Tajima's [28] and Fu & Li's [29] statistics. Within each species, all populations present similar levels of polymorphism with the exception of <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> from Ilhéus, which seems to be less polymorphic than the others. This population was also the only one presenting a significant value in the Fu & Li test but only at the 5% level. Finally, the last column of Table 1 presents the recombination estimator γ [30] indicating that both species show evidence of intragenic recombination in the per gene.
To investigate the level of intra and interspecific differences, initially an AMOVA was carried out as shown in Table 2. The results show a non-significant within species and a significant between species molecular variation at the per locus. Table 3 shows a more detailed analysis of the intraspecific differentiation among populations of <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span>. None of the pairwise and overall fixation indexes (Fst) are significant in the case of <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and only one (Posse × Ilhéus) has a borderline significant value in <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span>. The results therefore show that no significant geographical heterogeneity was detected among the populations of the two species. The estimated number of migrants per generation, based on the overall Fst values, is 20.683 for <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and 23.125 for <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span>.
Table 4 shows measures for DNA divergence between species (Dxy and Da), as well as the Fst and Nm values considering each species as a unique population. Dxy is the average number of nucleotide substitutions per site between alleles from two different populations and Da is the number of net nucleotide substitutions between two populations. Table 4 also shows the number of polymorphisms exclusive for each species (Sint and Swhit), the number of shared polymorphisms (Ss) and the number of fixed differences (Sf) between species. As one can note, there is a high number of shared polymorphisms between species, and no fixed differences between them suggesting either the persistence of ancestral polymorphisms or the occurrence of introgression. In fact, there is one shared haplotype between the two species (IPO13, WPO10 and WPO19) and three <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> sequences (WAC02, WPO13 and WPO14) which show only one nucleotide difference to "typical" <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> haplotypes (see also below).<br><br>Genealogy of period sequences
A phylogenetic analysis of the period gene sequences from <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> was carried out with the Minimum Evolution method using the Kimura 2-parameter distance (Fig 3). A sequence from <span class="yellow">L. umbratilis</span>, a related species from the same subgenus Nyssomyia, was used as outgroup [24]. The tree shows <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> as non-monophyletic. However, despite the low bootstrap values, which are below 50% in most cases, there is a large group that contains most <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> sequences and a second large group with most <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> sequences. A few other sequences are clustered outside these two main groups. It is interesting to note that there are three <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> alleles (WAC2, WPO13 and WPO14) inside <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> main group, as well as one <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> allele (ICP16) inside the <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> main group. In addition, a second <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> allele (IPO13) is a shared haplotype between the two species as mentioned above. Again, the results suggest either the persistence of ancestral polymorphisms or the occurrence of introgression between the two species. Very similar results were obtained using the maximum likelihood algorithm as implemented in PAUP 4.0b10 software [31] (data not shown).
As mentioned before, there is evidence of intragenic recombination in the per gene fragment of both species (see Table 1) and for that reason the bifurcating tree shown in Fig 3 has to be viewed with caution, as different regions of the gene might have different phylogenetic histories [32]. Therefore, we constructed Minimum Evolution trees with the two most polymorphic non-recombining blocks of the per gene fragment identified using the Hudson and Kaplan [33] method available in the DNAsp 4.1 program [34]. We did not observed major changes in the genealogy of the <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> per sequences, especially regarding the five haplotypes (ICP16, IPO13, WAC2, WPO13 and WPO14) that clearly cluster with sequences of the other species (data not shown).
Finally, a haplotype network was estimated from per sequences using statistical parsimony, as described by Templeton et al. [35] and implemented in the TCS1.21 software [36] (Fig 4). A small number of ambiguities were resolved as suggested by Crandall and Templeton [37]. The haplotype network shows connections between sequences from each species, separating most of the sequences of <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> in two groups. No intraspecific geographical structuring was found. Once again, some of the <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> sequences (WAC2, WAC10, WPO13 and WPO14) appear more closely related to <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> haplotypes. In addition, one <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> allele (ICP16) is connected by a small number of mutations to some of the main <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> haplotypes and IPO13 is a shared haplotype between the two species. These results confirm the same putative introgressed sequences indicated by the phylogenetic reconstructions.<br><br>LD test of introgression
We tested the hypothesis of gene flow between <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> using a method based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) developed by Machado et al. [38]. In this test, x is the difference between the average LD found among all pairs of shared polymorphisms (DSS) between the two species and the average LD among all pairs of sites for which one member is a shared polymorphism and the other is an exclusive polymorphism (DSX). In case of gene flow x should tend to be positive [see [38] for more details].
Because of limitations on the total number of sequences that could be handled by the WH program we could not perform the simulations with all sequences. Therefore, we carried out the LD test of introgression between each pair of sympatric populations of <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> from the localities of Posse, Afonso Claudio and Corte de Pedra. The input files were prepared using the values of recombination and linkage disequilibrium calculated by the SITES program [30] for each population (data not shown). Although no significant values were found for the smaller samples of Afonso Claudio and Corte de Pedra, the results (Table 5) present evidence for introgression in the period gene in both directions (from <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> to <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> and vice-versa) in the locality of Posse.<br><br>Isolation with Migration model
To further examine the gene flow between <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> we used the IM software [39]. The Isolation with Migration model has six demographic parameters that include two migration rates, one for each population. The IM software estimates the posterior probability for each of the model parameters, fitting the Isolation with Migration model to the data. One of the assumptions of this model is that the loci studied do not have internal recombination. Therefore, we identified four different non-recombining blocks of our fragment of per, which were then treated as different loci in the analysis. The four-gametes test [33] implemented in DnaSP4.1 was used for the identification of possible recombination events. Since the program estimates parameters for a pair of closely related populations or species, all sequences of each species were used in the analysis as a single population. We performed MCMC runs using the IM software with different seed numbers, in order to guarantee convergence of the sample.
Maximum likelihood estimates of migration parameters revealed a non-zero value for both species, m1 = 1.398 and m2 = 1.014 (m1 – from <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> towards <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span>; m2 – from <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> towards <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span>). Fig 5 shows the posterior distributions for migration rates and reveals a null probability for the absence of migration from <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> towards <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span>. In addition, the absence of migration in the opposite direction is not included in the 95% confidence interval (values range from 0.222 to 8.898), thus supporting the presence of migration in both directions. The conversion of the migration rate estimate to population migration rate per generation (m1 and m2) is not accurate when the population size is based on a single locus. However, the average of the migrant number per generation for both species was very close to the Nm estimate based on Fst values (Nm ~0.49 in Table 4, m1 ~0.52 and m2 ~0.34).<br><br>
Discussion
There is some evidence that <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> might represent sibling-species complexes in Brazil. <span class="yellow">Lutzomyia neivai</span> Pinto 1926, a sibling of <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> is found in parts of Southern and Western Brazil and some other countries of South America [40]. The present study did not include populations of this species. In the case of <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span>, mitochondrial data [3,6] indicates three main lineages in Brazil: an Amazonian group, a North-South group and a Northeast group. We did not find strong evidence of a geographical differentiation in the period gene among populations of <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> although one of the pairwise Fst comparisons (Posse × Ilhéus) was significant at the 5% level.
When we compare <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span>, we find a highly significant Fst value (0.3373), which is however smaller than that observed for the period gene between sympatric siblings of <span class="yellow">Lutzomyia longipalpis</span> (Fst = 0.3952) [23], a complex of cryptic species that are vectors of American visceral leishmaniasis. Therefore, despite the presence of diagnostic morphological characters to identify <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> [1] the level of molecular divergence in period is not as high as the cryptic <span class="yellow">L. longipalpis</span> siblings.
Even though it is hard to distinguish introgression from the persistence of ancestral polymorphisms, a test of gene flow based on the signature introgression leaves on the patterns of linkage disequilibrium [38] as well as simulations that fit the "Isolation with Migration" model to the data suggest that <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> might be exchanging alleles at the per locus. This is further supported by the presence of shared haplotypes between the two species in Posse and very similar sequences in all sympatric populations. There is mounting evidence that introgression plays a major role in the evolution of closely related insect vector species. Introgression among vectors may have important epidemiological consequences. Gene flow in loci that affect vectorial capacity, such as those controlling host preference and susceptibility to parasite infection, can change the transmission patterns and consequently make the disease control a harder task. Introgression of genes that control adaptation to particular types of environment can also have a major impact on the spread of vector-borne diseases as was proposed for the major African malaria vector <span class="yellow">Anopheles gambiae</span> [41]. The same can be said about genes controlling insecticide resistance. For example, Weill et al. [42] found a kdr mutation responsible for pyrethroid resistance in the Mopti form of <span class="yellow">Anopheles gambiae</span>, a normally susceptible taxon of this species complex. Sequence analysis reveals that this resistant allele probably originates through introgression from the Savanna form.
Although <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> are closely related and only distinguished by a few morphological differences, they do show differentiation in some other important traits. For example, in Posse, one of the localities we studied, the two species show differences in abundance during the year. <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> is more abundant in the summer while <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> is more frequent in the winter months [2]. They also show differences in microhabitat preferences, <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> being more common in the peridomestic area while <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> is found mainly in the surrounding forest [2]. In addition, the two species show marked differences in their tendencies to bite <span class="yellow">humans</span> in the early morning, with <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> showing higher feeding rates than <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> [26]. Therefore, despite the evidence of introgression in the period gene in this locality, there are important ecological and behavioral differences between the two species in Posse suggesting that gene flow is probably rather limited in loci controlling these traits. Hence, it is yet not clear whether introgression has played an important role in the evolution of <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span>. Further work with other genes might help clarify the issue.<br><br>Conclusion
Evidence for introgression between <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> obtained using mitochondrial DNA [4] seems to be corroborated by our data on the period gene, a nuclear marker. Nevertheless, considering that period is potentially involved in reproductive isolation and might be, therefore, less prone to introgression than the "average" gene [43], it is possible that much higher levels of gene flow between the two species occur at other genes. It might, on the other hand, suggest that this behavioral gene, or at least the fragment we analyzed, did not play a role in speciation between <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span>. In fact the same has been suggested for some <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> species [44] despite per's role controlling lovesong and mating rhythm differences between <span class="yellow">D. melanogaster</span> and <span class="yellow">D. simulans</span> [13-16].
Although the evidence for introgression in the per gene between <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> is not overwhelming, it does indicate the need to extend this analysis to other loci in the future. We are currently isolating new molecular markers in the two species to carry out a multi-locus approach [39] that might help determining how much variation in gene flow and differentiation there is across the genome of these two very important leishmaniasis vectors.<br><br>Methods
Sand <span class="red">fly</span> samples
Sand <span class="red">fly</span> samples used in this work were all the F1 generation from wild collected females from the Brazilian localities of Posse (Petrópolis, Rio de Janeiro State, 22°30'S 43°10'W), Jacarepaguá (Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro State, 22°55'S 43°21'W), Afonso Claudio (Espírito Santo State, 20°04'S 41°07'W), Corte de Pedra (Presidente Tancredo Neves, Bahia State, 13°27'S 39°25'W) and Ilhéus (Bahia State, 14°50'S 39°06'W). <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> were identified according to Young and Duncan [1]. The progeny of each wild caught female was raised separately according to Souza et al. [45] and only one F1 male of each female was used for the molecular analysis, which included 68 individuals of <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> (12 from Afonso Claudio, 18 from Posse, 20 from Corte de Pedra and 18 from Jacarepaguá) and 51 individuals of <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> (12 from Afonso Claudio, 17 from Posse, 3 from Corte de Pedra and 19 from Ilhéus). Note that, although the distribution of the two species shows considerable overlap in Eastern Brazil, in many localities only one species is found or is far more abundant than the other. There are also seasonal and microhabitat differences in abundance between them in areas of sympatry [2].<br><br>DNA methods
Genomic DNA was prepared according to Jowett [46] with slight modifications and the PCR was carried out for 30 cycles at 95°C for 30 sec, 60°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 30 sec, using Abgene, Amersham Biosciences or Biotools reagents according to manufacturers directions. The per primer sequences are: 5llper2: 5'-AGCATCCTTTTGTAGCAAAC-3' (forward) and 3llper2: 5'-TCAGATGAACTCTTGCTGTC-3' (reverse). These primers amplify a 486 bp fragment of the sand <span class="red">fly</span> per gene homologue that includes part of the PAS/CLD domain, an intron (58 bp) and the beginning of the perS domain [24]. The amplified fragments were cloned using the pMOSBlue blunt ended cloning kit (Amersham Biosciences) and plasmid DNA preparation was carried out using the "Flexiprep" Kit (Amersham Biosciences). Cloned PCR fragments were sequenced at Fundação Oswaldo Cruz and at University of Leicester using ABI 377 sequencers. With the exception of two <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> individuals from Corte de Pedra (see below), only one sequence of each sand <span class="red">fly</span> (representing one of the two possible alleles) was used in the analysis but an average of three sequences per individual were obtained in order to check possible PCR induced mutations. In addition, PCR fragments were also sequenced directly in some cases for the same reason. In the case of the two <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> mentioned above 6 and 9 clones were sequenced respectively from specimens WCP01 and WCP03 to determine both alleles simply to increase the size of this small sample.
Negative controls were performed for all amplification reactions. In addition, PCR, cloning and sequencing were repeated for two individuals to confirm putative introgressed sequences and to exclude the possibility that they were the result of PCR contamination. Finally, for at least two individuals with putative introgressed sequences, we could define the other allele from additional clones (not included in the analysis), which showed to be typical of the species, indicating no identification problems.

<h3>pmcA1838407</h3>Video analysis of the escape flight of <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span> <span class="yellow">Dryocopus pileatus</span>: does the <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> <span class="yellow">Campephilus principalis</span> persist in continental North America?
Abstract
Background
The apparent rediscovery of the <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> <span class="yellow">Campephilus principalis</span> in Arkansas, USA, previously feared extinct, was supported by video evidence of a single bird in flight (Fitzpatrick et al, Science 2005, 308:1460–1462). Plumage patterns and wingbeat frequency of the putative <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> were said to be incompatible with the only possible confusion species native to the area, the <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span> <span class="yellow">Dryocopus pileatus</span>.<br><br>Results
New video analysis of <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> in escape flights comparable to that of the putative <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> filmed in Arkansas shows that <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> can display a wingbeat frequency equivalent to that of the Arkansas bird during escape flight. The critical frames from the Arkansas video that were used to identify the bird as an <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> are shown to be equally, or more, compatible with the <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span>.<br><br>Conclusion
The identification of the bird filmed in Arkansas in April 2004 as an <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> is best regarded as unsafe. The similarities between the Arkansas bird and known <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> suggest that it was most likely a <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span>.<br><br><br><br>Background
The reported rediscovery of the <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> in 2004–5 in the Big Woods of Arkansas gave new impetus to efforts to conserve the mature bottomland woodlands of the south-eastern USA. Several sightings have been reported without photographic evidence being obtained [1]. Unless sightings are, however, independently verifiable on the basis of photographic or other recorded evidence, the possibility that mistakes have been made cannot be eliminated. Crucial to the scientific case for the persistence of the <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> was a 4 s video of a large woodpecker in flight recorded by M.D. Luneau on 25 April 2004 (henceforth referred to as the 'Luneau video') and published in 2005 [1], which was claimed to be inconsistent with the plumage patterns of the superficially similar <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span> (a common resident bird of the area). Both species are large, black-and-white woodpeckers [2]. The upperwing of the <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> is black, with white secondary feathers and white on some inner primary feathers. <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> have a largely black upperwing, with white restricted to the 'wrist' due to white bases to the primary feathers. The underwing of <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span> has all-white underwing coverts, giving an appearance of a white underwing with a broad black outline (the black flight feathers). These plumage differences result in the <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> having a white trailing edge to the wings (upper and lower sides), whereas the <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span> has a black trailing edge to the wings. Both species have black wing-tips. These and other plumage characteristics are shown in [1,2]. The wingbeat frequency of the bird in the Luneau video was measured at 8.6 beats s-1, similar to that inferred from archival sound recording of a single <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span>, but claimed to be outside the range of <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> (which generally have slower wingbeats) [1,3].
Sibley et al [4] questioned the video evidence, in particular providing alternative explanations for the plumage patterns of the Luneau bird in flight and at rest. They pointed out individual frames of the Luneau video that appear to show three features that are each inconsistent with <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span>: (1) apparently black secondary feathers on the upper surface of the left wing, (2) particularly bright white primary bases, and (3) a black band curving smoothly round the wing tip (see Figure 3 in [4]). They hypothesized that flexing of a <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span>'s wings during flight could produce the appearance of white trailing edges on both wings in low-quality videos [4]. They offered, however, no direct evidence to show that this could cause a video of a <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span> to look like the bird in the Luneau video. Fitzpatrick et al [5] in turn rebutted some aspects of the hypothesis of Sibley et al [4], publishing video stills of <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span>, and a model of a <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span>, that appeared to show a black trailing edge to the wings inconsistent with <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> and the Luneau video. Fitzpatrick et al [5] neither rebutted nor discussed the three key inconsistencies described above. Without further evidence, this became largely a theoretical debate over interpretation of field characters that were barely visible in the very small images originally obtained. On one hand, as pointed out in Sibley et al [4], some of the frames of the bird in the Luneau video do appear to be inconsistent with <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span>. On the other hand, the flight pattern of the bird in the Luneau video is asserted to be atypical for <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span> (but matching anecdotal descriptions of <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span>). Furthermore, the general impression of the bird in the Luneau video was that there is far too much white in the wings for it to be a <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span>, and that if it was a <span class="yellow">Pileated</span>, then it must be an aberrant one with abnormally extensive white plumage. Such birds occasionally occur, and have been observed in the Arkansas study area [6].
This study was undertaken to determine whether the flight and plumage of the bird in the Luneau video really was inconsistent with either a normal or partial albino <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span>. Independent analyses of the plumage patterns and wingbeat frequencies observable in <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> are presented, and it is concluded that the identification of the bird in the Luneau video as definite <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> is probably unsafe.<br><br>Results
On January 28 and February 5, 2006, David Nolin (DN) video-recorded <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> <span class="yellow">Dryocopus pileatus</span> at a bird-feeder in Dayton, Ohio, USA. A Hi-8 Sony Handycam was used, hand-held, at approximately 5 m from the feeder. Birds on the tree trunk were alarmed by movement, and their escape flights recorded. Four escape flights were captured that approximate to that recorded for the putative <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> <span class="yellow">Campephilus principalis</span> by Luneau in April 2004 and published in Fitzpatrick et al [1]. The videos are not directly equivalent because the <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> made only short escape flights to nearby trees, whereas the putative <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> in the Luneau video showed little sign of coming to rest before being lost from view. Nevertheless, interesting comparisons can be made.
Wingbeat frequency of <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span>
The woodpecker in the Luneau video maintains a steady rapid wingbeat rate of 8.6 beats s-1 for at least 8 wingbeats [1], a figure that was confirmed by independent analysis during preparation of this paper. The <span class="yellow">Pileated woodpeckers</span> in DN's video do not do this – after initial rapid flapping immediately after take-off, they settle into a more relaxed level flight. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, although the mean wingbeat frequencies of the <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> in DN's video are slower than the 8.6 s-1 recorded for the bird in the Luneau video [1,3,5] the first four wingbeats, the initial escape response, are faster than those claimed for <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> in the literature [1,3,5]. For the four escape flights, the mean frequency values for the first four wingbeats are 7.1, 6.7, 8.6, and 8.0 s-1, respectively. The 8.6 beats s-1 of the bird identified in the Luneau video, while consistent with the limited data (n = 1; see Discussion) for <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span>, is equally consistent with <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span> in its initial escape flight. The bird in the Luneau video maintains a frequency of 8.6 s-1 for the next four wingbeats too, whereas the <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> recorded here all slowed their flight as they prepared to land in nearby trees. There are no data to suggest whether <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> can maintain a wingbeat frequency approaching 8.6 s-1 for eight or more wingbeats, like the bird in the Luneau video. It remains possible that the flight pattern of the bird in the Luneau video is unusual for <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span>, but a frequency of 8.6 s-1 is consistent with a <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span> gaining initial speed and height in escape flight, and by itself cannot be taken as strong evidence that the Luneau video bird was an <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span>. This is discussed further below.<br><br>Plumage pattern of <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> in flight
The video of <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> in flight was obtained in avi format, decompiled and examined frame by frame. Comparisons of <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span> images with key images of Luneau video are shown in Figures 1 and 2, and suggest a genuine resemblance between the bird in the Luneau video and a <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span>. Analysis is complicated by the different digital processing of the two videos, and in the case of the Nolin videos it is important to concentrate only on those frames or part-frames where apparent plumage features are not an artifact of blurred images. Thirty-six frames from the fourth example of <span class="yellow">Pileated</span> escape flight, which most resembled the flight path of the Luneau video bird, were analysed systematically frame by frame. They represent seven complete wingbeats (1.20 s from the middle of the second wingbeat to middle of wingbeat 9) and were directly compared frame-by-frame with the equivalent fields (middle wingbeat 2 – middle wingbeat 9) of the Luneau video. This comparison is shown in Figure 3. The images of the birds are not identical, but in every frame of the 36 frames available, there are sufficient similarities to suggest that the bird in the Luneau video is consistent with the known <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span>. Further comparisons of the Luneau bird with the other three <span class="yellow">Pileated</span> escape flights recorded are presented in the supplementary material (see Additional file 1).
Key findings of the video analysis are:
1. <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> flying near-horizontally away from the observer show much more white in poor-quality video than would be expected from their general plumage pattern. They present an appearance of a black-bodied bird with largely white wings and black wingtips, very similar to the bird in the Luneau video; compare in particular Figure 1B, frame 758, with Figure 1A, frame 283.3. The expected appearance of the upperwing of <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span> – mostly black with a small white patch at the base of the primaries – is often not seen, and is only clearly resolvable when birds are flying near-vertically before landing on a tree trunk; something the bird in the Luneau video did not do.
2. The black trailing edge to the underwing of <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span> is often very inconspicuous and may disappear completely. Due to motion and flexion of the wing, the black trailing edge is much more obvious towards the wingtips. This produces an apparent plumage pattern that matches the patterns shown by the Luneau video bird (compare Figure 1B, frames 175 and 457 with Figure 1A, frames 300 and 416.7). In many frames of <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span>, a black trailing edge to the wing is discernable (though due to bleeding of white as a video artifact, it appears narrower than it really is). However, analysis of the bird in the Luneau video in light of images of known <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> confirms that a similar black trailing edge to the wing is discernable in some frames of the Luneau video (compare Figure 1B, frame 775 with Figure 1A, frame 366.7: the apparent plumage patterns are similar, and inconsistent with <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span>). It is argued here that the hypothesis put forward in Sibley et al [4] is correct, and that the black trailing edge of the underwing of <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span> can indeed, due to flexion of the wings during the downstroke, be misinterpreted as the black leading edge and wingtips of the upperwing of an <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span>.
3. Figure 3 shows that the plumage patterns shown by the Luneau bird, throughout several wingbeat cycles, are compatible with <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span>. The three plumage features described in Sibley et al [4] that are incompatible with <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> (black secondary feathers on upper surface of left wing, brighter white primary bases, and a black band curling round the wing tip) are seen consistently in the Luneau video and are recapitulated throughout the video of <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span>.<br><br>
Discussion
Evidence is presented here to show that the distinctive plumage features of <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span> are surprisingly difficult to resolve in poor-quality video of birds in escape flight away from the camera, and that they can show apparent plumage patterns that might more readily be associated with <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span>. Irrespective of the identity of the bird in the Luneau video, this knowledge will be critical to assessment of further claims of <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpeckers</span> during the current intensive search effort. It is, however, suggested here that critical frames used for identification of the Luneau video woodpecker as an <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> are also consistent with <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span>. The wingbeat frequency of the bird in the Luneau video is also perhaps consistent with <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span>, at least for short periods of flight.
Analysis of the videos of <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span> has supported the hypothesised interpretations of key frames of the Luneau video by Sibley et al [4]. Although the rebuttal of that comment in Fitzpatrick et al [5] asserted that flexion and motion of wings of <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> could not produce the images seen in the Luneau video, it has been shown here that they can.
The Luneau video as presented in Fitzpatrick et al [1], shows features that are consistent with <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span>, and inconsistent with <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span>. It is argued in this paper that, in fact, the black trailing edge of the wing of a <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span> is seen clearly in the Luneau video, during the downstroke of the wingbeat cycle, but that it has been misinterpreted as black wingtips (Figure 1, 2, 3).
A fuller analysis of the Luneau video by the Cornell University team is presented online [7]. Although it is not peer-reviewed, the points this article makes should be taken into account. The authors summarise nine diagnostic traits from their analysis of the Luneau video that identify the bird as <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span>. These are listed and discussed point-by point below.
1. 'The underwing pattern in flight consistently appears largely white, giving the appearance of having black wingtips but lacking any black along the rear, or trailing edge.'
Data presented in this paper show that this statement is not wholly supported, and in any case the underwing of <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> can present the same appearance.
2. 'The upperwing pattern in flight consistently shows a broad, white trailing edge, with no frames demonstrating the conspicuous dark rear border to be expected of normal <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span>.'
Notwithstanding that certain frames of the Luneau video (e.g. frame 350) do appear to show a black trailing edge to the upperwing, data presented in this paper shows that, at this angle of view and resolution of video, <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> also may fail to show this feature. This analysis has shown that the hypothesis presented in Sibley et al [4] is plausible, i.e. that some of the frames interpreted by [1] to show the upperwing of an <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> may in fact show large amounts of white and the black trailing edge from the underwing of a <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span>.
3. 'The wings are longer relative to the body diameter than in <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span> and consistent with the wing shape of <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span>.'
Fitzpatrick et al [5] agreed that accurate measurements were not possible from the video images presented in their original paper [1], and it seems unlikely that much confidence can be placed in the wing-length measurements of the bird in the Luneau video. Comparison of, for example, Figure 1A, frame 283.3 with Figure 1B, frame 578 suggests that any differences will be very difficult to prove.
4. 'Reenactment of the scene using life-sized, realistically painted, dynamically flapping models produced images remarkably similar to those of the Luneau video using the <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> model, and images clearly identifiable as <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span> using a model of that species.'
Interpretation of model re-enactments is hampered by the fact that the stiff, flat-winged models cannot reflect the wing flexion and curvature of real birds. Reenactment of the scene using real <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> has produced images remarkably similar to the Luneau video.
5. 'The wingbeat frequency is 8.6 beats per second, which is almost identical to that recorded for <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> (as documented by one acoustic record from 1935). The wing-beat frequencies of <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span> are not known to exceed 7.5 beats per second, and more typically range between 3 and 6 beats per second.'
The fact that in only four recorded escape flights of <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span>, two were recorded for which the initial escape flight wingbeat frequency (8.0 s-1 and 8.6 s-1) exceeded that previously recorded for this species shows that previous datasets were too limited to make this conclusion. Birds flap more rapidly at take off to gain altitude and speed than they do in sustained level flight: <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span> flight data in the literature [1,4,5] was derived from the work of Tobalske [8], which explicitly excluded the initial take-off period, and therefore cannot be used to support the elimination of <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span> in the Luneau video. Furthermore, the bird in the Luneau video is consistently gaining height from a low position above water and, whatever its species, might be expected to flap more rapidly than if it were in level flight. Tanner [9] noted that <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> can maintain extended fast direct flight. He was of the opinion that flight pattern was not a useful character for separating the two species in the field, and that <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> frequently <span class="red">fly</span> in a manner that was in no way different to <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpeckers</span>.
The figure of 8.6 wingbeats per second for the Luneau bird (data reanalysed here) is taken as consistent with <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> on the basis of analysis of a single archival audio recording [3]. The <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> in that audio tape is clearly flapping its wings, but without accompanying visual confirmation it is not clear that it is in flight. In general, larger birds are expected to flap their wings more slowly than smaller birds of comparable wing morphology. Tobalske [8] showed that, across species, smaller woodpeckers tend to flap more quickly than larger ones, and that there was considerable intraspecific variation. The assertion that <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpeckers</span> flap their wings more quickly than <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> is therefore counterintuitive. Further comment is conjecture: while the flight pattern and wing posture of the bird in the Luneau video may be unusual, it has not been shown that it is outside the range of variability of <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span>, and cannot therefore be used to eliminate the possibility that it was the commoner species.
6. 'White plumage on the back is visible on the retreating bird as it begins to gain altitude. <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> has white on the back; <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span> has entirely black back.'
This was discussed by Sibley et al [4], who argued that the images thought to show white on the dorsum were too small to be accepted uncritically. In all the frames of the Luneau video that appear to show white on the dorsum, the bird is distant (dorsal white is not visible on the higher resolution images earlier in the video) and partially obscured, making it difficult to distinguish dorsum from wing. Spurious areas of white pixels appear as artifacts in both videos. Nevertheless, this remains the best evidence that the Luneau bird was not a standard <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span>.
7. 'The dorsal view of the right wing as it begins to unfold shows a triangle of white that matches in size and position the white on the folded wing of an <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> beginning to launch into flight.'
No further comment is provided here. An alternative explanation was offered by Sibley et al [4] and rebutted by Fitzpatrick et al [5]. The statement requires a degree of certainty about the position of the wing.
(8) 'The distance between the wrist area and the tip of the tail (32–36 cm, as measured when the bird begins to take flight) is comparable to known measurements of <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> and considerably larger than even the largest <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span> we measured.'
As stated under (3), above, there is general agreement that accurate measurements are not possible from the Luneau video because too many uncontrolled variables are involved [4,5].
9. 'Only 20 seconds before the woodpecker flees, a bird with the size and color pattern of an <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> was perched within 3 m of the site from which the woodpecker took flight.'
This would be a strong argument if it could be shown that the object in question was a bird and not, as is now apparently thought likely, a section of branch or tree stump [10]. The Luneau video reveals several white triangular patches apparently visible on or around tree trunks, most or all of which must therefore be images of tree topography or video artifacts. This was discussed in the literature (see [4,5]).
Central to the identification of the flying bird seen in the Luneau video was the evidence that plumage and flight patterns were inconsistent with <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span>. A very basic video analysis presented here has suggested that this may not be the case, and that further research is needed. Any identification of the bird in the Luneau video as an <span class="yellow">Ivory-bill</span> must take into account the data presented here and in Sibley et al [4], which shows it is largely consistent with <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span> and points out apparent inconsistencies with <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span>. This does not of course necessarily imply that the <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> is extinct, nor indeed entirely rule out the possibility that the bird in the Luneau video was one. There appears to be no reason to question the anecdotal sight records of <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> presented in Fitzpatrick et al [1] (or in many online sources), because some of them appear credible, albeit brief. Audio evidence has since been published [11] although this too is far from conclusive. However, to regard the Luneau video by itself as presenting anything other than an unidentified woodpecker falls below the standards of proof normally required for scientific publication: the images are not good enough. The <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> may persist in continental North America, and there is enough anecdotal evidence to make this a possibility, but the Luneau video does not support the case. The balance of evidence would suggest that the bird in the Luneau video is more likely to have been a <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span>, but the search for <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> should continue.
While this paper was under review, a report of sight records and sound recordings of <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpeckers</span> was published from a location in Florida [12]. This very exciting claim is strengthened by reports of sighting of the white dorsal stripes on one bird in flight. Unfortunately, several sightings were made without optical aids and cannot be considered proven. The 'kent' calls recorded from the Florida location are spectrographically similar to the 'bleat' calls of young <span class="yellow">White-tailed Deer</span>, as described in Richardson et al [13]. A clear photograph will be required from this location too before the presence of <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpeckers</span> can be considered confirmed. It is hoped that this paper will help with assessment of any further low quality photographs or videos.<br><br>Conclusion
Flight and plumage patterns of the putative <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> recorded in Arkansas in 2005 are recapitulated by confirmed <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span>. The bird in the Arkansas video is best regarded as not fully identified, and is probably a <span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpecker</span>.<br><br>Methods
Video recording
<span class="yellow">Pileated Woodpeckers</span> were attracted to a bird feeder containing suet at Grants Trail, Dayton, OH 45459. The suet feeder was placed approximately 2.1 m high on a tree trunk, and the distance to the suet feeder from the observation point was approximately 5 m. Birds on the feeder were startled by movement of window blinds on January 28 and February 5, 2006, and their escape flights were filmed using a Sony Hi-8 SteadyShot video camera at 29.97 frames s-1. At least two birds feature in the videos, male and female.
Analogue tape was converted to digital by connecting the Hi-8 camera directly to a Sony DCR-HC30 digital video camera and recording onto that camera's mini dv cassette. The resulting images were converted to an avi file using Windows Movie Maker on a Windows XP PC. The video is freely available in wmv format [14] and in avi format from the author or David Nolin (via the author). The video was decompiled using Blaze Media Pro (Mystik Media, Hampstead, NC, USA) for a detailed analysis. Import into Avid® Xpress Pro HD for deinterlacing did not reduce the wing flicker seen in the images, and further professional processing could not improve the resolution, so the original decompiled file was used for analysis. Hence some frames contain two overlaid images, which may lower the resolution in some cases. The decompiled file was examined frame by frame and compared to the decompiled images of the putative <span class="yellow">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</span> presented in Fitzpatrick et al [1].
Wingbeat frequencies were calculated by noting the frame number of the midpoint of the downstroke of each wingbeat (e.g. Figure 1B, frame 758) and calculating the length of time taken per wingbeat as (number of frames between downstroke midpoints)/29.97.<br><br>

Abstract
Recent studies have shown that particulate air pollution is a risk factor for hospitalization for heart and lung disease; however, little is known about what subpopulations are most sensitive to this pollutant. We analyzed Medicare hospital admissions for heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders (COPD) and pneumonia in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois, between 1985 and 1994. We examined whether previous admissions or secondary diagnoses for selected conditions predisposed <span class="yellow">persons</span> to having a greater risk from air pollution. We also considered effect modification by age, sex, and race. We found that the air-pollution-associated increase in hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases was almost doubled in subjects with concurrent respiratory infections. The risk was also increased by a previous admission for conduction disorders. For COPD and pneumonia admissions, diagnosis of conduction disorders or dysrhythmias increased the risk of particulate matter < 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM(10))-associated admissions. <span class="yellow">Persons</span> with asthma had twice the risk of a PM(10)-associated pneumonia admission and <span class="yellow">persons</span> with heart failure had twice the risk of PM(10)-induced COPD admissions. The PM(10) effect did not vary by sex, age, and race. These results suggest that <span class="yellow">patients</span> with acute respiratory infections or defects in the electrical control of the heart are a risk group for particulate matter effects.

The PM10 effect did not vary by sex, age, and race. These results suggest that <span class="yellow">patients</span> with acute respiratory infections or defects in the electrical control of the heart are a risk group for particulate matter effects. Key words: effect modification, hospital admissions, particulate air pollution. Environ Health Perspect 108:841�845 (2000). [Online 28 July 2000] http://ehpnet1.niehs.nih.gov/docs/2000/108p841-845zanobetti/abstract.html <br><br> Particulate air pollution has been associated with increases in daily deaths and hospital admissions in studies all over the world (1�15). These associations are now well documented but little is known, as yet, of the characteristics of <span class="yellow">persons</span> that put them at increased risk of adverse events related to particulate air pollution. This has been identified as a key data gap (16). Schwartz and Dockery (17) reported that <span class="yellow">persons</span> older than 65 years of age had a somewhat increased risk of death, and this has been confirmed in other studies (18). A more detailed examination of particulate matter-related risk by deciles of age (19) showed the risk beginning to increase at approximately 40 years of age and reaching its maximum for those 75 years of age and older. In addition to age, several studies suggest that <span class="yellow">persons</span> with respiratory illness are at increased risk for cardiovascular effects associated with air pollution. An examination of death certificates on high- and low-air pollution days reported a substantial difference in the proportion of deaths from cardiovascular causes that had respiratory disease as a contributing cause of death (19). A recent follow-up study of a cohort of <span class="yellow">persons</span> with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Barcelona, Spain, found an association between particulate air pollution and all-cause mortality in the cohort (20). The magnitude of the risk per microgram per cubic meter of exposure was substantially greater than that for the general population. Environmental Health Perspectives <br><br> Controlled exposure of animals with chronic bronchitis and control animals to concentrated air particles also demonstrated a potentiating effect of chronic lung disease in the response to airborne particles (21). This has led to the hypothesis that the cardiovascular effects of air pollution are predominantly in <span class="yellow">persons</span> with chronic lung disease. There has been even less done to examine potential modifiers of the effects of airborne particles on hospital admissions. The existing literature on comorbidity shows that comorbidity per se seems to increase the risk of adverse outcomes (22�30). Little is known about the role of these comorbidities as effect modifiers for the effects of air pollution. This study uses data from the Medicare system to examine potential short-term and long-term medical conditions that may increase a <span class="yellow">person</span>'s risk of hospital admissions associated with particulate air pollution. In addition, we examine potential effect modification by age, race, and sex. <br><br> Materials and Methods Health data. The Health Care Financing Administration (Baltimore, MD) maintains records of every hospital admission for Medicare <span class="yellow">participants</span> in the United States. <span class="yellow">Persons</span> in this database have a unique identifier. Using this identifier, we traced every hospital admission for heart and lung disease for each <span class="yellow">person</span> in Cook County, Illinois, between 1985 and 1994. We chose Cook County because it is the most populous <br><br> county in the United States with daily monitoring for particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 10 �m (PM10). The data were then analyzed to look at effect modification by concurrent and preexisting conditions as well as by age, race, and sex. To establish a baseline risk, we computed daily counts of hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease (CVD) [International Classification of Disease, 9th edition, World Health Organization, Geneva (ICD-9) code 390�429], pneumonia (ICD-9 code 480�487), and COPD (ICD-9 code 490�496, excluding 493). The association between these daily counts and PM10 was examined for the years 1988�1994, when daily PM10 monitoring data were available in Chicago. Once our baseline risks were established, we examined three classes of potential effect modifiers. First, we looked at whether previous admissions for selected conditions predisposed <span class="yellow">persons</span> to having a greater risk from air pollution. For each of the three admission categories (CVD, pneumonia, and COPD), we considered 10 causes (defined by a previous admission) as effect modifiers: COPD (ICD-9 code 490�496 except 493), asthma (ICD-9 code 493), acute bronchitis (ICD-9 code 466), acute respiratory illness (ICD-9 code 460�466), pneumonia (ICD-9 code 480�487), CVD (ICD-9 code 390�429), myocardial infarction (ICD-9 code 410), congestive heart failure (ICD-9 code 428), conduction disorders (ICD-9 code 426), and dysrhythmias (ICD9 code 427). To test the hypothesis that <span class="yellow">persons</span> with these conditions had higher risks of subsequent PM10-related admissions, we computed separate daily counts of admissions for our three target causes, stratified by whether or not the <span class="yellow">person</span> admitted had been previously admitted for the hypothesized predisposing condition. Separate analyses were then performed within each strata to see if the effects of PM10 differed by strata. Address correspondence to A.

These could represent the presence of a chronic condition (e.g., COPD) that has not resulted in a previous hospital admission. They could also represent acute conditions that may have increased the subjects' sensitivity to air pollution. For example, if respiratory infections modified the effect of particulate matter on the cardiovascular health of <span class="yellow">persons</span> with underlying heart disease, then the risk of a hospital admission for heart disease might be different in <span class="yellow">persons</span> with infections. If this were true, then the risk ratio of a 10-�g/m3 increase of PM10 on cardiovascular admissions of <span class="yellow">persons</span> with a concurrent respiratory infection would be different from the ratio in <span class="yellow">persons</span> without respiratory infection. To test these hypotheses, we computed separate daily counts of admissions for events with and without the concurrent conditions hypothesized to increase sensitivity to air pollution. These were taken as the same 10 conditions in the first analysis with certain exclusions for pairing that would be illogical. That is, the concurrent diagnosis of a specific cardiac condition was not treated as an effect modifier for admissions for any cardiovascular condition. Likewise, pneumonia and COPD were not possible concurrent conditions for each other. The third set of predisposing conditions considered was being older than 75 years of age, nonwhite, and female. These were examined for all three outcomes. We obtained weather data for O'Hare Airport from the EarthInfo CD-ROM (EarthInfo CD NCDC Surface Airways, EarthInfo Inc., Boulder, CO), and we obtained air pollution data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Aerometric Information Retrieval System network (31). <br><br> running-line smoother, loess (35), was chosen to estimate the smooth function. To control for weather variables and day of the week, we chose the smoothing parameter that minimized the Akaike's information criterion (36). To model seasonality we chose the smoothing parameter that minimized the sum of the autocorrelation of the residuals while removing seasonal patterns. Two autoregressive terms (37) were added in the model to eliminate the remaining serial correlation from the residuals. We used the mean of PM10 on the day of the admission and the day before the admission as our exposure variable. This gives results that are similar to those obtained fitting a full distributed lag model (38). PM10 was treated linearly. Our baseline models used the daily counts of CVD, pneumonia, and COPD admissions as outcomes. We then subdivided those counts by the presence or absence of the potential effect modifier and reestimated our regressions on those subgroups. We considered effect modification to be indicated when the estimates of PM10 in the group with the condition was outside of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the effect estimate in <span class="yellow">persons</span> without the condition. <br><br> Results Table 1 shows the mean daily admissions for COPD, cardiovascular, and pneumonia both overall and in the presence of the potential effect modifiers. For some effect modifiers such as conduction disorders or myocardial infarctions, the counts in conjunction with our respiratory outcomes are <br><br> low, which limits power. In general, the numbers are lower for examining effect modification by previous admissions than for effect modification by concurrent diagnosis. This is as expected because many clinically relevant comorbidities may never have resulted in a hospital admission. Table 2 shows the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile values for the environmental variables. The mean value for PM10 is 33 �g/m3. The daily values for PM10 were computed as the average of 10 monitors, two of which measured PM10 almost every day and the others less frequently (38). Table 3 shows the mean daily counts of CVD, COPD, and pneumonia by sex, age groups, and race. The distribution by sex is almost even, although the counts of admissions for males are generally lower (approximately 10%) than for females, particularly for cardiovascular diseases. The counts of CVD, COPD, and pneumonia admissions were similar for <span class="yellow">people</span> 65�75 or 75 years of age and older. Tables 4�6 show the results for the effect PM10 overall and stratifying by concurrent diagnosis and previous admissions. These are expressed as the percentage increase for 10 �g/m3 PM10. Table 4 shows the results for CVD. A 10-�g/m3 increase in PM10 was associated with a 1.31% (5% CI, 0.97%; 95% CI, 1.66%) increase in hospital admissions for heart disease in all elderly <span class="yellow">persons</span>. A concurrent (not previous) diagnosis of COPD modified the risk of PM10-associated admissions for heart disease. However, significant associations were still seen between PM10 <br><br> Table 1.

A significant association was also seen in <span class="yellow">persons</span> without any respiratory disease as a concurrent diagnosis, although the risk is much lower than in <span class="yellow">persons</span> with respiratory disease. However, the risk associated with PM10 was roughly doubled in subjects with concurrent respiratory infections and the risk estimates in those subjects were outside the 95% CI of the risk in <span class="yellow">patients</span> without concurrent respiratory infections. A previous admission for conduction disorders (e.g., heart block) increased the risk of a PM10-related subsequent admission for any heart condition, and a weaker indication of effect modification was seen for <span class="yellow">persons</span> with previous admission for dysrhythmias. In contrast heart failure and previous myocardial infarctions were highly insignificant as effect modifiers. Table 5 shows the results for COPD. Overall, there is a 1.89% (95% CI, 0.8�3.0) increase in COPD admissions for a 10�g/m3 increase in PM10. The results of the stratified analysis suggest that preexisting heart disease modifies Table 4.

Previous admissions for any cardiovascular disease increased the risk of a PM10associated COPD admission approximately 2.5-fold. A previous heart failure admission caused an even more striking increase in the PM10 effect. Previous admissions for dysrhythmias and conduction defects were rare (Table 1) with no power to examine effect modifications. Listings as concurrent diagnoses were more common and here they joined heart failure in increasing the risk of PM 10 -associated COPD admissions. For COPD there was also some indication that concurrent pneumonia or an acute respiratory infection admission in the last year increased risk. The low numbers made these estimates less precise, however. The percentage increase in pneumonia admission (Table 6) for 10 �g/m3 PM10 is higher than for COPD or CVD with an increase of 2.34% (95% CI, 1.66�3.0). As with COPD, <span class="yellow">persons</span> with heart disease appeared at higher risk of pneumonia hospital admissions associated with particulate air pollution. Here diagnoses suggestive of impaired autonomic control of the heart, such as conduction disorders or dysrhythmias, were associated with increased risk for PM 10 effects on pneumonia admissions. Unlike COPD, no difference was seen for congestive heart failure. <span class="yellow">Persons</span> with asthma Table 5.

Table 7 shows the results by sex, age, and race. None of the effect size estimates for any of the stratification variables were outside of the 95% CI for the opposite strata. There was a tendency for the effect of PM10 on CVD admissions to be higher for females, whereas the effect on pneumonia admissions was higher for males. In general, we found somewhat larger effects on whites compared to nonwhites, and for <span class="yellow">persons</span> older than 75 years of age compared to younger <span class="yellow">persons</span>. <br><br> Discussion In this analysis we examined whether the effect of PM10 on the risk of hospital admission for heart and lung disease was different depending on the presence of comorbidities. We found that PM10 was associated with hospital admissions for all three causes (CVD, COPD, and pneumonia) and we found not a general increase in PM10 related risk with comorbidities, but a specific pattern that is suggestive of potential mechanisms and consistent with other recent epidemiologic and toxicologic findings. One major finding of this study is that preexisting cardiovascular disease, particularly impaired autonomic control (conduction defects and dysrhythmias) and heart failure, substantially increased the risk of respiratory admissions associated with airborne particles. In fact, recent <span class="yellow">human</span> studies have shown that exposure to particulate air pollution is a risk factor for reduced heart rate variability (39�41). Reduced heart rate variability is an adverse response and a risk factor for arrhythmia. A new study of defibrillator discharges in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with implanted cardioverter defibrillators found that discharges were associated with air pollution (42).

This is the first study to suggest <span class="yellow">persons</span> with defects in the electrical control of the heart are also at higher risk of respiratory illness after exposure to airborne particles. These data also suggest that <span class="yellow">persons</span> admitted to hospitals for pneumonia during an air pollution episode may be at high risk for clinically significant conduction disorders during that hospital admission. <span class="yellow">Patients</span> with congestive heart failure were at greater risk of hospital admissions for COPD in association with airborne particles. Heart failure and COPD is not an uncommon combination. The finding that these <span class="yellow">patients</span> are at higher risk for admissions associated with particulate air pollution is new but is also consistent with several other recent reports. The spontaneous hypertensive <span class="yellow">rat</span> develops a model of heart failure, and recent studies have reported greater sensitivity to particulate air pollution in these <span class="yellow">rats</span>. These include both electrocardiogram abnormalities (44) and pulmonary toxicity (45,46). Similarly, in an epidemiologic study, Hoek et al. (47), found a higher relative risk of death with an increase in PM10 for congestive heart failure deaths than other deaths. The potential role of COPD in those heart failure deaths was not examined. Another consistent pattern in our data is of acute respiratory infections increasing susceptibility to airborne particles. Acute bronchitis, or more generally acute upper respiratory illnesses, as well as pneumonia, increased susceptibility to particle-associated admissions for CVD and COPD. The notion that air pollution exacerbates acute respiratory infections is well supported by studies which report associations between airborne particles and hospital admissions for respiratory infections (48,49). Zelikoff et al. (50) exposed <span class="yellow">rats</span> infected with streptococcus to concentrated air particles and reported a significant increase in bacterial burdens and in the extent of pneumonia compared to animals exposed to filtrated air. This suggests an impaired immune response. Similarly, exposure to combustion <br><br> particles enhances influenza infections in <span class="yellow">mice</span> (51). An impaired defense to respiratory infection is a major reason that <span class="yellow">persons</span> with COPD require hospital admission. If airborne particles result in further impairment the effect modification we observe makes good sense. The effect modification for heart disease admissions is more relevant. This modification is consistent with the earlier report of Schwartz (19), who found greater reports of respiratory complications on death certificates with an underlying cause of heart disease if the death occurred on a day with high levels of airborne particles. Although airborne particle exposure has been associated with increased exacerbation of asthma (2,12,48,52�59), this paper is the first to suggest that asthmatics are more susceptible to PM10-induced pneumonia exacerbation or to cardiovascular effects. The effects on pneumonia admissions are plausible, given the impaired ability to fight off infections in asthmatics with mucus plugs and the evidence the airborne particles impair the lungs' ability to fight off bacterial and viral infections, as noted earlier. The increased cardiovascular sensitivity, albeit weaker, is interesting. If airborne particles affect the cardiovascular system via the role of the lung in autonomic control, it is possible that asthmatics would be more sensitive to those effects. Animal models of asthma showed that combustion particles enhance the asthmatic response to aeroallergen challenges (59). This suggests an enhancement of pulmonary response in asthmatics. On the other hand, the diagnosis of asthma is problematic in the elderly, and crossover with COPD is possible. The possibility that this explains our results is reduced by our failure to find previous hospital admission for COPD was an effect modifier for the effect of particles on cardiovascular admissions. We must acknowledge several potential limitations of this study. First, we considered only previous admissions that occurred within Cook County. Hence <span class="yellow">persons</span> with previous admissions elsewhere would be misclassified to our reference group. The effect of this would be to reduce the difference in PM 10 effect between the two groups. VOLUME <br><br> Nevertheless, we identified some interesting interactions. We cannot exclude the possibility that there are areas we missed for this reason. We also examined interactions in a log relative risk model, which is inherently multiplicative. Although we believe this is justified because doubling the population exposed would be expected to double the pollution associated admissions, it results in a more conservative definition of interaction than would an additive risk model. Finally, our exposure is clearly measured with error. Most of this error is Berkson error (60) and hence will introduce no bias, and Zeger et al. (60) showed that the remaining error would have to have pathologic correlations with other variables to result in an upward bias. Another important result from this study, of course, is an estimate of the magnitude of the effect of airborne particles on public health. The PM10 concentrations in Chicago during this period were associated with approximately 1,600 additional admissions per year for heart disease, 740 additional admissions per year for pneumonia, and 170 additional admissions per year for COPD. These are not trivial increases in serious morbidity. The results of our study should be replicated in additional cities, although they do begin to fill in some missing information about the effects of airborne particles on health. More generally airborne particles have been associated with a broad range of systemic changes including heart rate variability (39�41), increased peripheral neutrophils (61�63), increased plasma viscosity (64), an increase in blood pressure (65), and the outcomes mentioned previously. The role of these systemic changes as potential sources of the specific effect modifications we have seen should be an area of fruitful research in the future. REFERENCES AND NOTES 1.

Abstract
Background
In both vertebrates and invertebrates, the oviduct is an epithelial tube surrounded by visceral muscles that serves as a conduit for gamete transport between the ovary and uterus. While <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> is a model system for tubular organ development, few studies have addressed the development of the <span class="blue">fly</span>'s oviduct. Recent studies in <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> have identified mating-responsive genes and proteins whose levels in the oviduct are altered by mating. Since many of these molecules (e.g. Muscle LIM protein 84B, Coracle, Neuroglian) have known roles in the differentiation of muscle and epithelia of other organs, mating may trigger similar differentiation events in the oviduct. This led us to hypothesize that mating mediates the last stages of oviduct differentiation in which organ-specific specializations arise.<br><br>Results
Using electron- and confocal-microscopy we identified tissue-wide post-mating changes in the oviduct including differentiation of cellular junctions, remodeling of extracellular matrix, increased myofibril formation, and increased innervation. Analysis of once- and twice-mated females reveals that some mating-responsive proteins respond only to the first mating, while others respond to both matings.<br><br>Conclusion
We uncovered ultrastructural changes in the mated oviduct that are consistent with the roles that mating-responsive proteins play in muscle and epithelial differentiation elsewhere. This suggests that mating triggers the late differentiation of the oviduct. Furthermore, we suggest that mating-responsive proteins that respond only to the first mating are involved in the final maturation of the oviduct while proteins that remain responsive to later matings are also involved in maintenance and ongoing function of the oviduct. Taken together, our results establish the oviduct as an attractive system to address mechanisms that regulate the late stages of differentiation and maintenance of a tubular organ.<br><br><br><br>Background
Most internal organs, including the vascular and respiratory systems and the gastro-intestinal and urinary-genital tracts are comprised of a single epithelial tube or a network of tubes. Tubular organs serve as conduits for the transport of gases, liquids, or solutes, and serve as barriers between biological compartments. To create tubes with specific flow and barrier properties, the morphology of the tube must be precisely specified during development and modulated by physiology. To accommodate specific physiological roles, tissue-specific programs for differentiation are employed at the last stages of development. While much is known about the molecular and cellular basis of tube formation [1-6], little is known about the mechanisms that regulate the late stages of differentiation in which organ-specific specializations arise.
The conservation of genes and similarity in tubular organ design across taxa make <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> an excellent model for understanding organogenesis in higher animals. In <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span>, the best understood tubular organs from a developmental point of view are the trachea and salivary gland. Studies of these organs reveal a general program for tubular organ development, in which combinatorial expression of global patterning genes specifies positions within the embryo for the subsequent activation of tissue-specific early genes and transcription factors. This program results in the activation of downstream genes involved in terminal differentiation of organ-specific specializations such as the cuticle that lines the tracheal lumen [1,2,4,7-9].
The <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> female reproductive tract is another tubular system, consisting of the uterus and a common oviduct (the main tube) that branches into two lateral oviducts. Regional differences in function are observed along the length of the tract, with egg activation occurring largely at the proximal end, in the lateral oviducts, and fertilization occurring at the distal end, in the uterus [10,11]. Unlike other tubular organs, little is known about the development of the female reproductive tract. However, regional differences in function suggest the presence of region-specific differentiation programs within the female reproductive tract.
In <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span>, mating induces changes in female behavior and physiology via molecules transmitted in the seminal fluid. These changes are rapid and lead to a mated female state which is profoundly different from the unmated female state. While an unmated female lays few eggs and readily accepts the courtship efforts of a male, a mated female exhibits increased egg-laying and actively rejects males [12-19]. Microarray studies of whole <span class="yellow">flies</span> reveal that the changes in egg-laying rate are accompanied by a change in gene expression. Within three hours of mating there is an increase in expression of a small number of genes [20,21]. Rapid changes in gene expression, as well as protein abundance, have also been observed in the female reproductive tract [22,23].
In the upper reproductive tract (lateral and common oviducts, hereafter, oviduct), mating induces an increase in immune related transcripts and down regulates transcription factors involved in cell growth and differentiation. At the protein level mating induces increased abundance of proteins associated with muscle assembly and function and cytoskeletal proteins associated with epithelial morphogenesis [23]. Since many of these mating-responsive proteins act in late differentiation pathways of muscle and epithelia elsewhere (e.g. Bent, Muscle LIM protein 84B(Mlp84B), Neuroglian (Nrg), Coracle (Cora)), we hypothesize that mating triggers similar differentiation in the oviduct. To test our hypothesis we characterized the ultrastructure of oviduct epithelia and muscle, as well as the pattern of innervation before and after mating. We then examined the effect of different mating regimes on oviduct mating-responsive cytoskeletal proteins and on female reproductive output. Our results suggest that active tissue remodeling takes place in the oviduct epithelia and musculature in response to mating. Furthermore, we found a striking increase in innervation of the oviduct after mating.
Our results show that the reproductive tract is an attractive system to address mechanisms that regulate the late stages of tissue differentiation in a tubular organ. Unlike other tubular organs, the last differentiation stage of the oviduct is triggered by an extrinsic cue (mating). This makes it possible to experimentally control the onset of differentiation, with an opportunity to independently examine the effects of mating and age. In addition, it allows us to examine processes essential for reproduction.<br><br>Results
Mating induces changes in oviduct lumen
Our previous molecular profiling showed that mating promotes changes in actin-based cytoskeletal molecules and suggests that mating triggers molecular changes and tissue remodeling in the female reproductive tract that mediate its progression to a mature functional stage [23]. To gain insight into the mechanisms that underlie this progression, we used light and electron microscopy to determine the morphological status of the oviduct in unmated and mated 3-day old females.
In nearly all mated reproductive tracts processed for microscopy (8/9), an egg was located in one of the lateral oviducts, whereas an egg was never observed in the oviduct of unmated reproductive tracts (5/5) (Figure 1). This observation is consistent with previous studies that report increased ovulation and egg-laying at 6 h post-mating [24]. In all unmated reproductive tracts examined, the region between the lateral oviducts and the middle of the common oviduct was either tapered or constricted, whereas this region appeared relaxed in the mated reproductive tract (Figure 1A and 1D). These observations raise the possibility that the lumen is narrow in the unmated oviduct and larger in the mated oviduct. To address this possibility, we collected serial 1 μm longitudinal sections through the reproductive tracts of unmated and mated females and stained these sections with toluidine blue to survey the appearance of the lumen along the entire length of the oviduct (Figure 1B and 1E). Our examination reveals that, in unmated reproductive tracts, the lateral oviduct lumen has an irregular shape, while the common oviduct lumen appears straight. Moreover, in all the unmated reproductive tracts sectioned, we detected patches of darkly stained material in the lumen of the lower common oviduct. In the mated reproductive tract, the lumen of the upper oviduct (defined as the lateral oviduct and upper part of the common oviduct) has an irregular shape, and the lumen of the lower oviduct (defined as the lower part of common oviduct) appears straight. In addition, the lumen of the lower oviduct appears wider in mated than unmated reproductive tracts (Figure 1C and 1F). Interestingly, darkly stained material was not detected in the oviduct lumen of mated females. This observation appears to be consistent with the description made by Mahowald et al. [25], who reported that the oviduct lumen of unmated females is nearly filled with an intima-like matrix and that this matrix is reduced after mating.
Because 3-day-old mated females lay eggs, it is unclear whether the lack of lumenal material and increase in lumen size in mated females occurred before or after the passage of eggs. We suggest that mating directly or indirectly induces morphological changes in the oviduct that facilitate egg passage through the duct. Taken together, our observations lead us to propose that the oviduct lumen is closed and/or obstructed in the unmated reproductive tract, and that mating induces changes in the epithelia and/or muscle that "open" the oviduct lumen.<br><br>Initial formation of cell-cell junctions in oviduct epithelia is mating-independent
To determine whether mating induces specific morphological changes in the oviduct epithelia post-mating, we next examined the ultrastructure of the oviduct epithelia in unmated and mated reproductive tracts. Since molecular profiling demonstrates that proteins associated with cellular junctions such as α- and β-Spectrin (Spec), Cora, and Nrg [23] increase post-mating, we first determined the status of the cellular junctions in the oviduct epithelia of unmated females, and whether these junctions change post-mating. In <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span>, most ectodermally derived epithelia (such as the epidermis and trachea), with a few exceptions, are joined apically by a belt-like adherens junction called the zonal adherens junction (ZA) followed basally by a septate junction (SJ) [26]. Our analysis reveals that the oviduct is lined, along its entire length, by a monolayered epithelium comprised of squamous-type cells. Although region-specific differences in morphology were observed, all oviduct epithelia examined, in both unmated and mated females, are joined along their lateral membranes by an extensive SJ and lack an apical ZA (Figure 2). SJs and ZAs form complete belts that surround the epithelial cell, thus making these junctions easily visible in transverse sections through the epithelium. Because ZAs were not detected in our transverse sections through the oviduct, this implies that ZAs never formed, or developed earlier and were lost (Figure 2D). Interestingly, we did not detect any ultrastructural differences in the SJs at 6 h post-mating, but we did uncover differences in SJ ultrastructure in different regions of the oviduct.
Based on their ultrastructure, two types of SJs, smooth and pleated, can be distinguished in <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> [26]. Smooth SJs are distinguished by the lack of visible septae and the appearance of electron dense material in the intercellular space, while pleated SJs are distinguished by the ladder-like appearance of septae. In the lateral oviducts and upper common oviduct, septa were not detected in the SJ, thus these SJs represent smooth SJs or an immature stage of pleated SJ (Figure 2A, 2A', 2A"). In contrast, a ladder-like arrangement of septae was often visible in the SJs of the lower common oviduct (Figure 2C'), thus these SJs can be classified as pleated. Unlike the smooth-like SJs of the upper oviduct, the pleated SJs of the lower oviduct are followed basally by spot type adherens junction (spot AJs) (Figure 2B, 2B'; additional file 1). Further analysis is necessary to determine if the SJs of the upper and lower oviduct represent different types or different developmental stages. Our findings demonstrate that the initial formation of SJs, as well as spot AJs in the lower oviduct, are mating-independent. This raises an interesting question. Why are SJ proteins such as Cora and Nrg up-regulated post-mating if SJs are formed prior to mating? It is possible that the increased expression of SJ proteins is associated with functional changes in polarized secretion post-mating. Recent studies have shown that SJs play an unexpected role in regulating the apical secretion of specialized extracellular matrix molecules in the trachea [27,28], and that these molecules are important regulators of lumen size.<br><br>Mating modulates apical secretory activity in the oviduct
Given the presence of extensive SJs in the oviduct and the role of SJs in regulating apical secretion of extracellular matrix molecules in other epithelia (e.g. trachea), we asked if mating modulates apical secretion in the oviduct epithelia. Our ultrastructural analysis reveals that different regions of the oviduct display different apical membrane morphology (i.e microvilli or pleats) (see Figures 2 and additional file 2A and 2A), but all epithelia are covered by an electron dense apical extracellular matrix (AECM) and a thin layer of cuticle. We found that mating induces ultrastructural changes in the AECM and cuticle in both the upper and lower oviduct. In the upper oviduct of the unmated female, the AECM varies in thickness along the apical surface (Figure 3A). Some areas have little AECM, while other areas are covered by a distinct layer of AECM (~1–2 μm in thickness; Figure 3B). However, the AECM of mated females is more evenly distributed along the apical surface, (~2 μm in thickness; Figure 3E). Strikingly, the AECM and cuticle of mated females have a ruffled appearance, suggesting that the AECM and cuticle have increased in surface area (Figure 3F). Electron dense granules up to ~1.5 μm in diameter were occasionally observed in both the AECM and cell cytoplasm (Figure 3F). Although further analysis is needed to determine the role of these granules in the oviduct epithelia, it is possible that these granules participate in the secretion and deposition of the AECM. Taken together, our findings suggest that polarized secretion via the AECM, while ongoing in the upper oviduct of the unmated female is enhanced and/or modulated post-mating.
Post-mating changes in AECM ultrastructure are also observed in the lower common oviduct. However, unlike the AECM of the upper oviduct, the AECM of the lower oviduct is well developed prior to mating. In the lower oviduct of the unmated female, the AECM consists of an amorphous electron dense material and is unevenly distributed, forming a thick, bulbous layer above the plasma membrane in some regions (additional file 2). Matrix-like material is also observed in the lumen, but this material is more electron dense than the AECM (additional file 2A and 2A). In the mated female, the AECM is flattened against the plasma membrane and is uniformly distributed along the apical surface (additional file 2B and 2B). Matrix-like material was not observed in the center of the lumen, but small pools of very electron dense material were detected in the spaces between the epithelial folds (additional file 2C and 2C). This may explain why lumenal matrix was not detected at the light microscopic level in the mated female oviduct (see Figure 1E and 1F). Taken together, our observations suggest that the lower common oviduct is a site of active apical secretion in both mated and unmated females, and that matrix secretion, particularly in the lumen, is reduced post-mating. These findings raise the intriguing possibility that the AECM and lumenal matrix function as a plug in the lower oviduct, and that mating induces the breakdown of this plug.<br><br>Mating induces changes in hemi-adherens junctions in upper oviduct
In addition to modulating secretion at the apical membrane, mating induces changes at the basolateral membrane. In many epithelia, one of the last steps of differentiation is the development of a layer of extracellular matrix (ECM) called the basal lamina that covers the apical and/or basal membranes and the concomitant development of hemi-adherens junctions (HAJs). HAJs connect the cell cytoskeleton with the ECM and are formed at virtually all cell surfaces that contact an ECM. HAJs can be distinguished at the ultrastructural level as a patch-like, electron dense undercoat of the plasma membrane that opposes the basal lamina ([26]; Figure 3G, 3H). In the <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> embryo, the HAJs and basal lamina are formed at the same time [26]. Because the basal lamina is established at a time when the majority of extracellular matrix molecules are actively secreted [26,29], this suggests that the formation of HAJs is tightly coordinated with the secretion of the ECM.
One of the most striking post-mating changes observed in the oviduct epithelia was the appearance of numerous HAJs along the basolateral membrane in the upper oviduct (Figure 3). The importance of HAJs, particularly in the upper oviduct, is underscored by the extensive infolding of the basolateral membrane that is observed in both unmated and mated females (Figure 3A and 3E). The infolded membrane gives rise to a highly branched intercellular space that is filled with an ECM (Figure 3C and 3G). This ECM is contiguous with the basal lamina that surrounds the epithelia. Few HAJs were observed in the upper oviduct of the unmated female, and these were largely restricted to the basal membrane, and not observed along the basolateral infolding (Figure 3C). In contrast, numerous HAJs appear along the basolateral infolding post-mating in this region of the oviduct (Figure 3F–3H). In addition, the intercellular space appears wider post-mating (Figure 3C–3D and 3G–3H), suggesting that mating induces increased secretion and/or deposition of the ECM in this cellular compartment and brings the ECM to a threshold concentration that can support the development of HAJs. HAJs were also detected along the basal membrane, but they were not detected along the apical membrane even though this membrane was covered by an ECM. Interestingly, while the basolateral membrane forms very shallow folds in the lower oviduct (see additional file 2), HAJs were observed along this membrane in unmated reproductive tracts (data not shown), thus suggesting that the epithelia is more differentiated in this region of the oviduct, and that the differentiation of the upper and lower oviduct may be under different control.<br><br>Muscle differentiation is enhanced post-mating
While we uncovered post-mating changes in the oviduct epithelia that might facilitate its transition to a high egg-laying state, this transition may also be mediated by changes in oviduct muscle properties and/or activity. The oviduct is lined by circular muscle fibers with supercontractile characteristics [30]. Our previous studies showed that mef2 and mlp84B genes that regulate muscle differentiation, are expressed and increased post-mating in the oviduct, as well as in the sperm storage regions of the reproductive tract [22,23]. This suggests that mating induces muscle differentiation in the reproductive tract. Muscle differentiation is characterized by the assembly of myofilaments into bundles called myofibrils. As muscles differentiate, myofibrils and z-bodies appear simultaneously, and increase in number until the cytoplasm is filled with myofibrils [31]. Like epithelia, one of the last steps of muscle differentiation is the secretion of a basal lamina that surrounds the muscle fiber. To determine if mating induces structural changes in muscles (such as increased myofibrils) we examined the ultrastructure of muscle fibers in the upper and lower parts of the oviduct. Our analysis revealed that, in both unmated and mated reproductive tracts, the muscles of the lower oviduct are highly differentiated as evidenced by the high density of myofibrils, well developed and aligned z-bodies, and secretion of a thick, electron dense basal lamina (Figure 4E and 4F). In contrast, muscle fibers in the lateral oviducts and upper common oviduct appear less differentiated than muscles in the lower common oviduct, as evidenced by the lesser density of myofibrils and z-bodies, and little or no basal lamina (Figure 4A and 4B). Moreover, the muscles of the upper oviduct appear more differentiated in the mated than in unmated reproductive tracts (Figure 4A–4D). Interestingly, we observed neighboring muscle fibers in different states of differentiation in the lateral oviducts in both unmated and mated reproductive tracts, but not elsewhere in the oviduct (Figure 4B). These results suggest that mating enhances the rate of muscle differentiation in the upper oviduct, and that muscle differentiation is delayed in the upper as compared to the lower oviduct. The increased muscle differentiation in the upper oviduct is not dramatic and likely reflects the short post-mating period examined in this study. The delayed differentiation of the upper oviduct muscles resembles the delay in the onset of development between the adult thoracic muscles and abdominal muscles during metamorphosis [32]. Since the ovaries and the other parts of the reproductive tract are known to have different segmental origins [33], we hypothesize that different parts of the oviduct develop at different rates or begin development at different times.<br><br>Increased innervation in the oviduct post-mating
Nerve-muscle interactions play an important role in regulating adult muscle development and refining the final pattern of innervation [34,35]. Given that oviduct muscle differentiation is enhanced post-mating, we predicted that mating either directly or indirectly induces changes in innervation. To address this prediction, we quantified the number of nerve terminals or boutons innervating the lateral oviducts and common oviduct in unmated and mated reproductive tracts. Studies of oviduct innervation in <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> reveal that the <span class="blue">fly</span>'s oviduct receives aminergic, peptidergic and glutamatergic input [30,36-39]. In both larval and adult <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span>, different types of boutons are formed by neurons that express different neurotransmitters and modulators [40-42]. By similarity to the boutons described at the larval and adult neuromuscular junction, Middleton et al. [30] report that the <span class="blue">fly</span>'s oviduct is innervated by glutamatergic type I boutons and tyraminergic/octopaminergic type II boutons. Rodgriguez-Valentin et al. [43] further report that the oviduct type II boutons co-express octopamine and glutamate. The neurons that give rise to the type I innervation have not been identified. However, it is well established that type II innervation arises from octopaminergic neurons located in the abdominal ganglion [30,43]. In addition, it has been shown that some or all of these neurons express a GAL4 insertion line for the bullwinkle (bwk) gene [43]. Bwk encodes a HMG-box containing putative transcription factor [44]. To determine if mating induces any changes in the number of type I and II boutons innervating the oviduct muscles, we used the pan-neural marker, anti-HRP to label all oviduct boutons in unmated and mated females. To distinguish between type I and II boutons we used an antibody against the Disc Large (DLG) protein [45]. Type I boutons were identified by their DLG postsynaptic staining and large size (> 8 μm in diameter) (Figure 4G), while type II boutons were distinguished by their absence of DLG staining and smaller size (< 2 μm) (Figure 4H). We find that type I and II boutons innervate the lateral oviducts and common oviduct, and that the type I innervation is restricted to a few axons that run parallel to the length of the oviduct, while the type II innervation is more widespread. We quantified the number of boutons in the lateral oviducts and common oviduct and observed a 74% increase in bouton number in the lateral oviduct and a 66% increase in the common oviduct post-mating (Figure 4I). More over, we observed no significant change in the number of type I boutons in the lateral oviduct and common oviduct. However, we detected a 1.5-fold increase in the number of type II boutons in the lateral oviduct and a 1.8-fold increase in type II innervation in the common oviduct. Dramatic increases in bouton growth are also observed during development. For example, a ten-fold increase in bouton number is observed at the neuromuscular junction during the larval period [46]. To determine if the increase in type II innervation was specific to mating or reflected normal growth in 3 day-old females, we quantified type I and II innervation in the oviducts of 5 day-old unmated females. We found no significant difference in type I and II innervation in unmated 3 day-old and 5-day-old females, indicating that mating, either directly or indirectly, induces a dramatic increase in type II innervation (Figure 4I). To determine if the post-mating increase in innervation is unique to the oviduct, we asked if mating induces a global change in innervation. We quantified bouton number in the adult ventral midline muscles of the 5th abdominal segment. These muscles are innervated by boutons that increase in number during metamorphosis [47]. No significant difference in bouton number was detected at these muscles in unmated and mated females (additional file 3). Though further analysis is needed, this suggests that the post-mating increase in innervation is oviduct-specific. Because the type II boutons are octopaminergic, the increased type II innervation may result in increased octopamine (OA) release in the oviduct. In support of this possibility, we have preliminary evidence that OA is released in the oviduct post-mating (Heifetz and Wolfner, in preparation). Studies in locust and <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> demonstrate that OA inhibits oviduct contraction, while glutamate activates oviduct contraction [30,43,48]. In <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span>, electrical stimulation of the posterior abdominal nerve gives rise to a series of muscle contractions in the oviduct followed by a period of muscle fatigue or relaxation [43]. This pattern of muscle contraction and relaxation may facilitate the proper movement of the egg through the oviduct. In their study of bwk expressing neurons that innervate the oviduct, Rodriguez-Valentin et al. [43] show that OA and glutamate interact to produce the pattern of oviduct contraction and relaxation described above. It is therefore possible that the post-mating increase in type II innervation in the oviduct plays an important role in the increased rate of ovulation and egg-laying observed post-mating.<br><br>Female mating history affects the enrichment of cytosekeletal proteins in the oviduct
To gain insights into the role of cytoskeletal protein enrichment ([23]; additional file 4) in mediating the morphological changes detected in this study, we examined the effect of different mating regimes on cytoskeletal protein abundance. We focused on a subset of mating-responsive cytoskeletal proteins with well established roles in the differentiation of muscle and epithelia. These include: (i) Mlp84B which regulates the late differentiation pathway of muscle [49]; (ii) Cora and Nrg which are required for the formation of septate junctions in epithelia [50], and (iii) Hu-li tai shao (Hts), also known as adducin-like protein, which functions in assembly of the cytoskeletal network. Na+ pump α subunit (ATPα), another protein associated with septate junctions in epithelia, is not a mating-responsive protein and was used as a control. Using western blots, we first determined the abundance of the cytoskeletal proteins in oviducts of 3-day-old unmated and mated females at 6 hrs post-mating. We confirmed the proteomic results of Kalpenikov et al. [23] and found that mating increases the abundance of all proteins, except ATPα in mated oviducts relative to their abundance in unmated oviducts (Figure 5A).
To determine whether the increased abundance of mating-responsive proteins persists for longer times post-mating, we examined oviducts of 10-day-old females that mated once at 3 days of age, and calculated the abundance of the mating-responsive proteins relative to their level in oviducts of 3-day-old unmated females. We found no change or a slight increase in the relative abundance of all cytoskeletal proteins except Mlp84B at 7 days post-mating (Figure 5A). Strikingly, the level of Mlp84B declines by 7 days post-mating to the level observed prior to mating. Thus Mlp84B levels rise and fall after mating, while the epithelial-related proteins rapidly rise and are maintained at a high level after mating. This raises the possibility that a second mating might trigger an increase in Mlp84B protein expression as observed in 3-day-old females at 6 h post-mating. To test this possibility, females were mated twice (once at day 3, and once on day 10 of age), and their oviducts were examined at 6 hrs after the second mating. We calculated the abundance of the cytoskeletal proteins in the twice mated oviducts relative to their abundance in oviducts of 3-day-old unmated females. Our results show that a second mating has little or no effect on Mlp84B abundance. Thus, Mlp84B may represent a class of mating-responsive proteins that is only needed after the first mating. Interestingly, the effect of the second mating on the epithelial-related mating-responsive proteins appears to be different for each protein. While Cora levels drop to the level observed in 3-day-old unmated females, Nrg and Hts are maintained at a high level.
To determine if the changes in cytoskeletal protein abundance are mating-dependent we measured their abundance in the oviducts of unmated 5- and 10-day-old females. We calculated their abundance relative to their level in oviducts of unmated 3-day-old females (Figure 5B). We rationalized that if the change in cytoskeletal protein abundance is mating-dependent we will not see similar changes in unmated females. We observed a slow increase in the relative abundance of all mating-responsive proteins with time post-eclosion (Figure 5B). Because unmated females lay more eggs as they age (see additional file 5C) one possible interpretation of the increased level of cytoskeletal proteins in unmated females is that these proteins are associated with an intrinsic program for oviduct maturation and that mating accelerates this process to maximize egg-laying efficacy. Alternatively, it is possible that the slow increase in protein abundance observed in unmated females is due to the passage of eggs through the oviduct.
Taken together, our results suggest that mating is essential to fine-tune the levels of the mating-responsive proteins examined in this study. Because the changes in cytoskeletal protein abundance are different in unmated and mated females, this suggests that the post-mating changes are mating-dependent. Furthermore, we suggest that these post-mating changes are linked to changes in oviduct function.<br><br>Early or prior mating increases fecundity
In <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span>, female fecundity decreases with age [51-54]. It has been proposed that this decrease is due, in part, to the loss of germline and somatic stem cells [55]. Since the expression of the oviduct cytoskeletal proteins examined in this study change with age and mating experience, the state of the oviduct may also play a role in fecundity. To separate the effects of age and mating, we measured the fecundity of females that mated twice, first at 3 days post-eclosion and again at 10 days, and compared that to the fecundity of females that mated once at 3 days and females that mated once at 10 days. Fecundity was measured as the number of eggs laid per day per female during the first three days after mating. Once-mated 3-day-old females laid nearly twice as many eggs as once-mated 10-day-old females during the three days examined (24.5 ± 0.7 versus 13.3 ± 0.9, p < 0.0001). Twice-mated 10-day-old females also laid about 50% more eggs than once-mated females of the same age (19.3 ± 0.9 versus 13.3 ± 0.9, p < 0. 0001), but about 20% fewer than laid by once-mated 3-day-old females during the three days examined (19.3 ± 0.9 versus 24.5 ± 0.7, p < 0.0001) (Figure 6A, see also additional file 5A and 5B). Thus, the difference in fecundity between once-mated 10-day-old and once-mated 3-day-old females is not a result of age alone. Rather the main determinant of fecundity at 10 days is whether there had been a prior mating at 3 days. We also calculated the fertility (number of adults eclosed) of once- and twice-mated females. Once-mated 3-day-old females are more fertile than once-mated 10-day-old females (69.5 ± 1.6% versus 56.1 ± 3.0%, p < 0.0001) and slightly more fertile than twice-mated 10-day-old females (69.5 ± 1.6% versus 62.7 ± 2.4%, p < 0.015) (Figure 6B, see also additional file 5D). Because there is no significant difference in fertility between once-mated and twice-mated 10-day-old females, this suggests that (1) a prior mating has no significant effect on the fertility of 10-day-old mated females and (2) fertility decreases with age. One intriguing interpretation of these results is that an early mating increases fecundity which partially compensates for the age-related decrease in fertility. Thus, cytoskeletal mating-responsive protein changes may be associated with structural changes in the oviduct that result in increased fecundity. This may counteract the effects of decreased fertility on the reproductive output.<br><br>
Discussion
Despite the use of <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> as a model system for organ-level biology and the emerging parallels between mammalian and <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> reproductive biology [56], this is the first integrative tissue-wide study of post-mating changes in the <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> oviduct. Our results provide several lines of evidence at the molecular, morphological and physiological levels suggesting that mating induces tissue-wide differentiation in the oviduct. Moreover, we identify ultrastructural changes in the mated oviduct that are consistent with the roles that some of the mating-responsive proteins examined in this study (e.g. Mlp84B, Cora, Nrg) are reported to play in muscle and epithelial differentiation elsewhere. For example, the increased abundance of Mlp84B, a major regulator of the late differentiation pathway of muscle [49] is consistent with the increased muscle differentiation in the upper oviduct post-mating (Figure 4A–4F). Similarly, the increased abundance of Cora and Nrg, molecules that are essential for SJ development and function [50] is consistent with the observation that SJs in the upper oviduct are immature and/or that mating induces changes in the apical extracellular matrix whose secretion may be regulated, in part, by SJs as occurs in the trachea [27,28]. Other post-mating changes that indicate that mating induces tissue-wide differentiation include increased HAJs along the basolateral membrane and increased innervation.
Analysis of protein abundance following different mating regimes (unmated, once-mated, twice-mated) gave us further insights into the possible roles that mating-responsive proteins play in the oviduct. For example, Mlp84B is only responsive to the first mating, while the epithelial proteins examined (Cora, Nrg and Hts) are responsive to the first and second mating. Furthermore, the response to the second mating is different from the response to the first mating. Taken together, these results suggest that Mlp84B is required for the final maturation of the oviduct, while the epithelial proteins examined are required for both the maturation and maintenance of the oviduct at a high functional state. Moreover, the post-mating pattern of Mlp84B supports the idea that the first mating induces the final maturation of the oviduct. The rise and fall of Mlp84B abundance after the first mating (Figure 5) parallels the expression pattern of Mlp84B during development where peaks in Mlp84B transcription occur during periods of embryogenesis and metamorphosis when muscle is differentiating [49].
Using different mating regimes we tested whether the first/early mating is essential for maintenance of high reproductive output in the second mating. Our results suggest that mating at an early age is essential to achieve maximum reproductive output (i.e. high fecundity and fertility). Since the first mating increases reproductive output (evidence from our mating regime experiments), it is likely that the ultrastructural changes detected in mated 3-day-old females lead to a highly functional oviduct.
We suggest that the final maturation of the oviduct includes a mating-dependent stage. We propose that during the first few days post-eclosion, the oviduct undergoes the first phase of differentiation, after which the oviduct is developmentally poised for a rapid response to an extrinsic cue (mating). Mating then triggers the second phase of maturation (tissue remodeling and modulation) which is essential for proper oviduct function (Figure 7). We further propose that the second phase of maturation consists of processes that are mating-independent and -dependent, and that both of these pathways are essential to produce a functional oviduct. For example, initial formation of SJs occurs prior to mating (mating-independent) while the increased apical secretion and development of HAJs are mating-dependent. The oviduct musculature is an example where both mating-independent and -dependent processes play a role. Muscles are highly differentiated in the lower oviduct prior to mating, while muscle differentiation is ongoing in the upper oviduct and increases after mating. Although the onset of muscle differentiation in both regions is mating-independent, the further differentiation of muscle in the upper oviduct is mating-dependent. Another possible interpretation of the role of mating on oviduct maturation is that mating accelerates and synchronizes processes that are essential for the functional maturation of the oviduct. It will therefore be interesting to examine the oviducts of older females to determine the status of oviduct maturation.
What is the benefit of mating-induced differentiation of the oviduct tissues? Unmated females are capable of laying eggs, albeit at a reduced rate as compared to mated females of the same age. One possible interpretation is that reproduction is energetically costly, thus delaying oviduct maturation until sperm is available is advantageous to the female. This may reflect the evolution of a mechanism to optimize reproductive capacity in early adulthood in short-lived animals.
In summary, we have identified events at the cellular, molecular and physiological levels that are part of an efficient and specific program for reproduction. <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> affords us the opportunity to uncover the signaling pathways that coordinate these events to produce a physiologically functional organ.<br><br>Methods
Flies
Wild-type Canton-S <span class="yellow">flies</span> were used for the fecundity/fertility experiments and confocal analysis. Wild-type Canton-S5 [57] <span class="yellow">flies</span> were used for electron microscopy. All <span class="yellow">flies</span> were kept in a 12 hrs light/dark cycle at 23 ± 2°C. Upon eclosion, females and males were collected on ice and held separately until 3 (females and males) or 10 (females) days of age.<br><br>Sample preparation
For all assays (unless described differently) unmated females were placed with 3-day-old unmated males and observed until mating initiated. At the end of mating, females were aspirated into fresh vials and held for 6 hrs. At 6 hrs after the start of mating, females were placed on ice for dissection. Previous molecular studies indicate changes in protein abundance at 3 hrs post-mating. We hypothesize that these molecular changes will translate into morphological changes in the next few hours. We chose to analyze the morphology of mated females at 6 h post-mating as opposed to later times post-mating because the changes observed at later times may be due, in part, to the high rate of eggs passing through the oviduct.<br><br>Electron microscopy
Reproductive tracts were dissected in Schneider's <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> medium (Sigma) on ice and processed for electron microscopy as described in [42]. Tracts were flat-embedded between two sheets of Aclar (Electron Microscopy Sciences), which allowed us to image the entire tract at the light microscopic level prior to sectioning. Sections were cut on a Reichart Ultracut microtome. One-μm thick sections were stained with 1% toluidine blue, and viewed with a Zeiss Axoplan microscope. Ultrathin sections (~100 nm) were mounted on formvar grids, stained with lead citrate, and viewed with a Philips/FEI Morgagni 268 TEM at 80 kV. Our analysis is based on 4 unmated samples and 3 mated samples. Two unmated samples were cut in the longitudinal plane and two additional unmated samples were cut in the transverse plane, while one mated sample was cut in the longitudinal plane and two additional mated samples were cut in the transverse plane. For longitudinal sections, the entire tract was re-embedded and cut. For samples cut in the transverse plane, the flat-embedded reproductive tract was divided into three regions: (1) lateral oviducts and upper common oviducts, (2) middle common oviduct, and (3) lower common oviduct. Each region was re-embedded and sectioned. It is beyond the scope of this paper to describe all three regions, and our analysis focuses on the uppermost and lowermost regions.<br><br>Immunocytochemistry
Reproductive tracts were dissected in Yamamoto's Ringer (10 mM MOPS; 80 mM NaCl; 10 mM KCL; 0.2 mM MgCl2; 0.1 mM CaCl2) with 5% (w/v) sucrose on ice, fixed in 4% paraphormaldehyde in PBS (phosphate-buffered saline; 0.85% NaCl, 1.4 mM KH2 PO4, 8 mM Na2 HPO4, pH 7.4) for 45 min and then washed in PBS. The reproductive tracts were then incubated in blocking solution (0.5% Triton x-100, 3% NGS, 0.1% BSA) for 2 hrs at room temperature. The following primary antibodies, reagents, and dilutions were used: Cy3-conjugated <span class="yellow">goat</span> anti-HRP, 1:200 (Jackson Immunochemicals, West Grove, PA); <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-Disc Large (DLG), 1:1000 (Developmental Hybridoma Bank), Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin, 1:200 (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes, Scotland). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Flour 488-conjugated <span class="yellow">Goat</span> anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span>, 1:200 and Alexa Flour 546-conjugated <span class="yellow">Goat</span> anti-<span class="yellow">rabbit</span>, 1:200 (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes, Scotland). Reproductive tracts were incubated with the different primary antibodies (diluted in PBS + 0.2% Triton x-100) for 2 hr at room temperature, washed with PBST, incubated with secondary antibodies for 2 hrs at room temperature and washed with PBS. Reproductive tracts of the different treatments were mounted with Antifade media [58] on a multi-well glass slide (Hendley-Essex, UK). For each treatment (unmated, mated) and antibody/reagent (HRP, DLG, phalloidin) a minimum of ten reproductive tracts from at least two independent biological replicates were prepared.<br><br>Confocal microscopy
Reproductive tracts were viewed with a Zeiss 510 laser scanning confocal microscope using 20× and 60× objective with additional zooming. Optical sections from different focal plans of each reproductive tract region (lateral oviducts, common oviduct, uterus) were collected and projected as a reconstructed three-dimensional image using LSM image browser (version 3,5,0,376) software. Image collections were identical for each of the different reproductive tract regions analyzed.<br><br>Quantitation of bouton number
To quantify the number of boutons in the lateral and common oviducts we used ImageJ software (1.37b, National Institutes of Health) to analyze confocal images of anti-HRP and anti-DLG labeled boutons in the oviduct. The number of boutons per unit area was quantified with the Particle Analysis Tool. Briefly, to differentiate between the boutons, the particle analysis tool requires the image to be a "binary" image (i.e., black or white), thus we first converted the images to gray scale. We then set a "threshold" range so that pixels in the image whose value lies in this range are converted to black; pixels with values outside this range are converted to white. We next defined a region of interest (ROI) within the oviduct to count particles (i.e. count boutons). This ROI was saved and served to measure the number of boutons per unit area in each treatment. For each oviduct we counted the number of anti-HRP and anti-DLG labeled boutons in two ROIs within the lateral oviducts and two ROIs in the common oviduct. One-way ANOVA (SPSS 15.0) was used to measure the difference in bouton number per unit area in different regions of the oviducts, in both unmated and mated females.<br><br>Quantitation of cytoskeleton proteins
Sample preparation
To evaluate the effect of mating on the abundance of the cytoskeleton proteins tested, females were: (i) aged for 3 days, mated with 3-day-old unmated males and their oviducts were dissected after 6 hrs post-mating (Once3); (ii) aged for 3 days, mated with 3-day-old unmated males and their oviducts were dissected after 7 days (Once3 day10); (iii) aged for 3 days, mated first with 3-day-old unmated males and held singly for 7 days. At 10 days of age, female were mated again with 3-day-old unmated males. Oviducts were dissected at 6 hrs post-second mating (Twice3&10). We also examined 5-day-old and 10-day-old unmated females (UM5, UM10 respectively).<br><br>SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting
For each mating regime, sixty oviducts were pooled and 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added as described in [59]. Samples were boiled, and then frozen at -20°C until loading. SDS-PAGE was performed on 12% polyacrylamide gels and western blotted as in [60]. Proteins were cross-linked to the filter. The following primary antibodies and dilutions were used: <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-Neuroglian (kindly provided by M. Hortsch) 1:250; <span class="yellow">Guinea pig</span> anti-Coracle (kindly provided by R.G. Fehon) 1:2500; <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-Mlp84B (kindly provided by M. Beckerle) 1:1000; <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-hts (1B1, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, DSHB) 1:75; <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-Na, K-ATPase (α5, DSHB) 1:100. Secondary antibodies included: anti-<span class="yellow">Guinea pig</span> IgG (peroxidase conjugated), anti-<span class="yellow">Rabbit</span> IgG and anti-<span class="yellow">Mouse</span> IgG (developed in <span class="yellow">goat</span>, Sigma, Israel) 1:10,000. Proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Piscataway, NJ).<br><br>Analysis
The developed film was scanned and the signal intensity (protein abundance) of each band was determined using ImageJ software (1.37d, National Institutes of Health). We evaluated protein abundance by measuring the mean gray value of a specific band and the background. The mean gray value of the background was then subtracted from that of the measured band. Relative protein abundance in mated oviduct vs. 3-day-old unmated oviduct was then calculated. Four independent biological replicates were prepared for each mating status. The reported abundance (see Figure 5) is the relative ratio (mated/unmated or unmated/unmated) of at least three replicates that showed the same trend.<br><br>
Examination of female reproductive output
Mating regimes
To evaluate the effect of mating on reproductive output females were treated as follows: (i) aged for 3 days and mated with 3-day-old unmated males (Once3); (ii) aged for 10 days and mated with 3-day-old unmated males (Once10); (iii) aged for 3 days, mated first with 3-day-old unmated males, held for 7 days and mated again with 3-day-old unmated males (Twice3&10). In all cases male and female pairs were observed to record mating initiation and termination.<br><br>Analysis
Following mating, females were aspirated into fresh vials, held singly and allowed to lay eggs for 6 hrs, then transferred daily (each 24 hrs) to fresh vials. The number of eggs laid and the number of eclosed adults were counted from vials created at 6 hrs, 1, 2 and 3 days post-mating. To ascertain the baseline of female egg-laying, we also included in our experiment unmated females that were kept in the same conditions as mated females. The number of eggs laid by unmated females was counted from vials created at 6 hrs, 1, 2 and 3 days after placing the females in the holding vials. In addition, we also recorded the pattern of unmated female egg-laying for 10 days.
To determine the effect of different mating regimes on female reproductive output (i.e. fecundity and fertility), we used One-way ANOVA (SPSS 15.0).<br><br><br><br>Abbreviations
