Abstract
Background
The mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor-II receptor (M6P/IGF2R) is a multi-functional protein that has been implicated in regulation of cell growth and apoptosis. Cardiac myocytes express relatively high levels of M6P/IGF2R, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis has been identified in a variety of cardiovascular disorders, such as myocardial infarction and heart failure. However, involvement of M6P/IGF2R in the pathogenesis of these conditions has not been determined. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the role of M6P/IGF2R in regulation of cardiac myocyte growth and apoptosis.<br><br>Results
We down-regulated the expression of M6P/IGF2R in neonatal <span class="yellow">rat</span> cardiac myocytes and examined the effect on cell proliferation and apoptosis. Infection of neonatal cardiomyocytes with an <span class="yellow">adenovirus</span> expressing a ribozyme targeted against the M6P/IGF2R significantly reduced the level of M6P/IGF2R mRNA, as determined by RT-PCR and Ribonuclease Protection Assay (RPA). M6P-containing protein binding and endocytosis as well as the M6P/IGF2R-mediated internalization of 125I-IGF-II were lower in the ribozyme-treated cells than the control myocytes, indicating that the number of functional M6P/IGF2R in the ribozyme treated cells was reduced. Accordingly, a marked increase in cell proliferation and a reduced cell susceptibility to hypoxia- and TNF-induced apoptosis were observed in the ribozyme-treated cells.<br><br>Conclusions
These findings suggest that M6P/IGF2R may play a role in regulation of cardiac myocyte growth and apoptosis. Down regulation of this gene in cardiac tissues might be a new approach to prevention of cell death or promotion of mitogenesis for certain heart diseases.<br><br><br><br>Background
The mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor-II receptor (M6P/IGF2R) is a unique protein that interacts with multiple ligands, some of which are important growth regulatory factors [1]. The M6P/IGF2R participates in internalization and lysosomal degradation of IGF-II, a mitogen normally acting through the IGF-I receptor to stimulate cell proliferation [2]. The M6P/IGF2 receptor is required for the activation of TGF-β [3], a potent growth inhibitor for many cell types. This receptor is also involved in the binding, transport and activation of newly-synthesized lysosomal enzymes, such as cathepsins [4,5], which have been recently implicated in the induction of apoptosis [6]. On the basis of these functions, the M6P/IGF2R has been proposed to play a significant role in regulation of cell growth and apoptosis [7].
Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a tightly regulated process used to remove excess, hazardous or damaged somatic cells, and is crucial for the development, maintenance and survival of an organism. However, alterations in the control of apoptosis have also been shown to contribute to <span class="yellow">human</span> diseases. In fact, morphological and biochemical markers of apoptosis have been identified in a wide variety of cardiovascular disorders, including myocardial infarction and heart failure. This suggests that activation of apoptotic pathways contributes to cardiomyocyte loss and subsequent cardiac dysfunction in these conditions. A number of factors involved in cardiomyocyte apoptosis are currently known and include insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) and the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family [8]. There are indications that other factors may be involved in induction and regulation of cardiac apoptosis. However, these potential factors and their corresponding mechanisms have not been identified.
Several lines of evidence point to the potential involvement of M6P/IGF2R in cardiac myocyte proliferation and apoptosis. Cardiac myocytes express relatively high levels of M6P/IGF2R and transgenic <span class="yellow">mice</span> containing a homologous deletion of the M6P/IGF2R gene manifest ventricular hyperplasia due to an increase in cell number [9,10], suggesting that the M6P/IGF2R normally acts to suppress cardiac myocyte cell growth. It has also been shown that TGF-β, a potent growth suppressor whose activation requires the binding of latent TGF-β to M6P/IGF2R [3], is commonly upregulated in chronic heart failure [11]. Additional evidence for the involvement of M6P/IGF2R in regulation of apoptosis comes from studies of tumorigenesis. It has been shown that M6P/IGF2R expression is significantly reduced in a variety of tumors and loss of heterozygocity (LOH) at the M6P/IGF2R gene locus 6q26 have been found in breast, liver cancers and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung [12-15]. Although several studies have examined the effect of M6P/IGF2R over-expression on cell growth [7], it is not known whether down-regulation of this receptor protein leads to cellular protection against apoptosis.
Ribozymes are catalytic RNA molecules that cleave a complementary mRNA sequence [16], thereby inactivating specific mRNAs and suppressing gene expression in vitro and in vivo [17,18]. Ribozymes have been shown to be highly specific, efficient and stable. They can be packaged into viral vectors to enhance transfer into cells and to achieve longer expression compared with naked oligonucleotides. In the present study, we employed ribozyme technology to study the role of M6P/IGF2R in regulation of cardiac myocyte cell growth. A hammerhead ribozyme against the M6P/IGF2R mRNA was constructed and packaged in an adenoviral vector. We then examined the effect of ribozyme-mediated down-regulation of M6P/IGF2R expression on cell growth and hypoxia- and TNF-induced apoptosis.<br><br>Results
Cleavage reaction of the ribozyme in vitro
The M6P/IGF2R ribozyme we constructed has 13-bp binding arms complementary to the target site of M6P/IGF2R mRNA, and a catalytic core (Fig. 1A). To evaluate the bioactivity of the ribozyme and the accessibility of the target site, a cleavage reaction was performed in vitro. The substrates, [α-32P] labeled RNA transcripts containing 45 bp of M6P/IGF2R mRNA or an unmatched sequence, were incubated with the ribozyme as described (see Materials and Methods). The ribozyme cleaved only the specific M6P/IGF2R mRNA into the expected products. In the assay of time course, the hammerhead ribozyme was able to cleave 24.2% of the M6P/IGF2R target within 10 minutes of incubation, 50.3% of the M6P/IGF2R target within 40 minutes of incubation, and by 640 minutes, 80.8% of the M6P/IGF2R target was converted to the expected products (Fig. 1B). This ribozyme did not digest the unmatched sequence (Fig. 1B). These results indicate a high efficiency and specificity of the ribozyme in vitro.<br><br>Ribozymes down-regulate M6P/IGF2R expression in cardiac myocytes
To examine the ability of the ribozyme to reduce levels of M6P/IGF2R mRNA in cultured cardiac myocytes, total RNA was extracted from cells infected with Ad-GFP/IGF2R-Rz or Ad-GFP, and subjected to RT-PCR using M6P/IGF2R-specific primers. Primers specific for β-actin were added to a parallel reaction to serve as an internal standard. Cells were used 4 days after infection, with average infection efficiency of 70–80% (for which a viral dose used had minimal cytotoxicity). The RT-PCR product of M6P/IGF2R was 856 bp, and the β-actin product was 285 bp. As shown in Fig. 2A, the Ad-GFP/IGF2R-Rz-infected cells exhibited a significantly lower level of M6P/IGF2R mRNA than Ad-GFP-infected cells, with a reduction of about 50%. This result was confirmed by ribonuclease protection assay (RPA), in which GAPDH was used as a control (Fig. 2C &2D). There was no significant difference in the level of M6P/IGF2R mRNA between Ad-GFP-infected cells and uninfected cells (data not shown), indicating that infection with the <span class="yellow">adenovirus</span> itself did not alter the endogenous M6P/IGF2R mRNA level. The results demonstrated that the ribozyme was highly effective in suppressing M6P/IGF2R expression in cultured cardiac myocytes.<br><br>Effect of ribozyme expression on the functional activity of M6P/IGF2R
To determine the effect of the ribozyme on the functional activity of M6P/IGF2R, binding and internalization of exogenous 125I-IGF-II was measured in cells infected with Ad-GFP/IGF2R-Rz. As shown in Fig. 3A, cells infected with Ad-GFP/IGF2R-Rz showed a 54% reduction in 125I-IGF-II internalization when compared with the control cells (infected with Ad-GFP). We also examined the effect of the ribozyme on the M6P-binding activity of the M6P/IGF2R using the M6P-bearing lysosomal enzyme, β-glucuronidase, as a probe. The results showed that the maximal M6P-binding capacity of cells treated with the ribozyme was about 50% less than that of controls (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, we assessed the ability of cells to internalize exogenous β-glucuronidase after treatment with ribozyme. Similarly, the M6P-inhibitable endocytosis of β-glucuronidase by ribozyme-treated cells was about 52% less than that of control cells (Fig. 3C). These results confirm that the number of functional M6P/IGF2R in ribozyme-treated cells was reduced.<br><br>Adenoviral delivery of ribozymes increases the proliferation of cardiac myocytes
We examined the effects of the ribozyme on the growth of cultured neonatal <span class="yellow">rat</span> cardiac myocytes. Morphological evaluation showed a remarkable difference in growth pattern between Ad-GFP/IGF2R-Rz-infected cells and the control cells: the ribozyme-expressing cells formed larger and more spread colonies (Fig. 4). Assessment of cell proliferative activity by the MTT assay and counts of viable cells showed that the number of cardiac myocytes in ribozyme-expressing cultures was significantly higher than in control cultures (Fig. 5). These results indicate that treatment with M6P/IGF2R-ribozyme can promote cardiac myocyte proliferation.<br><br>Effect of M6P/IGF2R-ribozyme expression on apoptosis of cardiac myocytes
We examined the effects of ribozyme expression on TNF-α and hypoxia-induced apoptosis of cultured cardiac myocytes. After a 24 hr challenge with hypoxia, the number of apoptotic cells in M6P/IGF2R-Rz expressing cultures was 38% lower than in control cultures as determined by Hoechst staining (which highlights the nuclei of apoptotic cells) and ELISA (Fig. 6A, 7A). MTT analysis showed that the number of viable cells in ribozyme-treated cultures was 40% higher than in control cultures (Fig. 7A).
After treatment with TNF-α, as shown in Fig. 6B, a large number of control cells underwent apoptosis, as indicated by morphological changes (small round shape) and bright blue nuclear staining. There were significantly more apoptotic cells in control cultures than in cultures expressing the Ad-GFP/IGF2R-Rz. The number of apoptotic cells, as measured by the cell death ELISA assay, in cultures infected with Ad-GFP/IGF2R-Rz was significantly (about 40%) lower than in cultures infected with Ad-GFP (Fig. 7B). Accordingly, the number of viable cells, as measured by MTT analysis, in cultures infected with Ad-GFP/IGF2R-Rz was significantly (about 45%) higher than in cultures infected with Ad-GFP (Fig. 7B). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that decreasing M6P/IGF2R expression by ribozyme treatment can reduce cell apoptosis.<br><br>
Discussion
Some 62,000,000 Americans have one or more types of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CVD is the leading cause (40.1%) of death in the United States. Myocardial infarction and heart failure, conditions accompanied by cardiac myocyte apoptosis, represent 23% of all CVDs and are a growing clinical challenge in need of novel therapeutic strategies. In this study, we investigated the M6P/IGF2R as a potential new therapeutic target for reduction of cardiac apoptosis and cardiac injury in these conditions.
Using ribozyme technology we down-regulated the expression of the M6P/IGF2R in neonatal cardiac myocytes. We then examined cell proliferation and apoptosis under normal conditions and post challenge with either hypoxia, a model of ischemia-reperfusion, or TNF-α, a cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic heart failure [19]. Our results demonstrate an association of a decrease in the expression and function of the M6P/IGF2R with increased cell proliferation and decreased cell susceptibility to hypoxia- and TNF-induced apoptosis. Expression of the ribozyme targeted against the M6P/IGF2R in cardiomyocytes resulted in down-regulation of M6P/IGF2R expression, as measured by RT-PCR and RPA, and of M6P/IGF2R function, as indicated by a decrease in internalization of 125I-IGF-II, and β-glucuronidase binding and endocytosis.
MTT analysis and viable cell counts showed that ribozyme-mediated down-regulation of M6P/IGF2R resulted in a marked increase in cell proliferation of cardiomyocytes, which normally express high levels of M6P/IGF2R [20] and have limited proliferative capabilities [21]. These results are consistent with the findings of previous knockout studies [9,10]. Since the M6P/IGF2R has multiple actions on cell growth, its proliferative effect on the heart cells observed in this study might involve multiple mechanisms. However, it is likely that unchecked IGF-II stimulation plays a key role in the effect. Because the M6P/IGF2R is believed to sequester and degrade IGF-II [2], a decrease in M6P/IGF2R expression and function could result in decreased degradation and hence increased bioavailability of IGF-II to the IGF-I receptor, which mediates the growth-promoting effect of IGF-II. Supporting evidence for the involvement of IGF-II in the proliferative effect resulting from loss of M6P/IGF2R function comes from studies of M6P/IGF2R knock-out <span class="yellow">mice</span>. M6P/IGF2R-null <span class="yellow">mice</span> display global hyperplasia that coincides with elevated levels of IGF-II. Most importantly, however, the lethal nature of an M6P/IGF2R-null phenotype is reversed in an IGF-II-null background [9]. Our results showing that ribozyme-mediated down-regulation of M6P/IGF2R lead to a decrease in IGF-II internalization support the above possibility. However, further investigation to confirm this mechanism is warranted.
More importantly, our results also showed that M6P/IGF2R down-regulation resulted in decreased sensitivity of cardiomyocytes to hypoxia- and TNF-induced apoptosis. There is evidence that lysosomal enzymes, such as cathepsins B and D contribute to hypoxia- and TNF-induced apoptosis in vitro [22-25] and in vivo [26,27]. The M6P/IGF2R has been shown to be involved in binding, transport and activation of lysosomal enzymes, including cathepsins [4,5]. Therefore, it is possible that down-regulation of the M6P/IGF2R results in improper trafficking and activation of cathepsins. This, in turn would eliminate the apoptotic cascades triggered by these enzymes under hypoxia and TNF stimulation and result in decreased sensitivity of cardiomyocytes to apoptosis.
It has also been shown that TNF stimulation involves the activation of TGF-β [28-30], a ligand of M6P/IGF2R that has been implicated in the progression of chronic heart failure [11,31]. Therefore, down-regulation of M6P/IGF2R expression could also lead to a decreased bioavailability of activated TGF-β, thereby decreasing the sensitivity of cardiomyocytes to the TNF/TGF-β apoptotic pathway. The detailed mechanism of the observed effects is unknown and requires further investigation.<br><br>Conclusions
The present study demonstrates that ribozyme-mediated down-regulation of expression and functional activity of the M6P/IGF2R results in a decrease in the susceptibility of cardiac myocytes to apoptotic stimuli. These findings suggest that this receptor might be involved in cardiac cell growth and apoptosis. The ability of the M6P/IGF2R ribozyme to reduce M6P/IGF2R expression and function in transfected cells verifies the utility of the ribozyme in studying the role of M6P/IGF2R in cardiomyocyte growth and apoptosis. In addition to its utility as a research tool, the ribozyme, with further exploration and development, might have potential application as a therapeutic agent to prevent cell death or promote mitogenesis for certain clinical conditions, such as, myocardial infarction and chronic heart failure.<br><br>Methods
Construction of recombinant M6P/IGF2R-RZ adenoviral vector
The nucleotide numbers of the <span class="yellow">rat</span> M6P/IGF2R sequence targeted by the hammerhead ribozyme is 1147–1160 after coding site (exon 9). The structure of the M6P/IGF2R hammerhead ribozyme is shown in Fig. 1. A 49 bp M6P/IGF2R ribozyme oligonucleotide, 5'-GAATTCCCC ACACTG ATGAGCCGCTTCGGCGGCGAAACATTCAAC GCGT-3' and the corresponding reverse complementary strand were synthesized. The fragments were subcloned to produce a plasmid containing a ribozyme against M6P/IGF2R. For construction of the recombinant <span class="yellow">adenovirus</span> containing the M6P/IGF2R-ribozyme (pAd-GFP/IGF2R-Rz), the segments containing the ribozymes were amplified by PCR and cloned into a pAdTrack-CMV vector and then recombined homologously with an adenoviral backbone pAdEasy 1 vector to generate (pAd-GFP/IGF2R-Rz), following the protocol described by He et al. [32]. The pAd-GFP/IGF2R-Rz carries both the IGF2R-Rz and GFP (as reporter) genes, each under the control of separate cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoters. Another viral vector, pAd-GFP, which carries the GFP gene only under the control of the CMV promoter, was generated and used as a control vector. The adenoviral vector DNA were linerized with Pac I and transfected into the replication-permissive 293 cells (E1A transcomplementing cell line) by using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies) to produce E1-deleted, replication-defective recombinant <span class="yellow">adenovirus</span> as described previously [33]. Large-scale amplification of recombinant <span class="yellow">adenovirus</span> in 293 cells was followed by purification using a discontinuous CsCl gradient. The constructs were confirmed by enzymatic digestion and DNA sequencing.<br><br>Transcription and cleavage reaction of ribozyme in vitro
Plasmids containing the ribozyme or the substrate (either 45 bp of M6P/IGF2R mRNA or an unmatched sequence 5'-GTGCTGTCTGTATG-3') were linearized with MluI, respectively. All transcripts were generated with T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). Substrate transcripts were labeled by incorporation of [α-32P] UTP (NEN Life Science Products, Inc.). Specific activity of the [α-32P] UTP (10 μCi/μl) and the base composition of each substrate molecule were used to calculate the substrate concentration. Ribozyme transcripts were quantified spectrophotometrically. (The half-life of the M6P/IGF2R target is about 280 minutes).
Cleavage reaction mixture contained substrate RNA (40 nM), increasing amounts of ribozyme (60 nM), 20 mM MgCl2 and 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0, in a final volume of 10 μl. The mixture was incubated at 37°C for a time-course of cleavage reaction from 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, to 640 minutes and the cleavage reaction was stopped by addition of loading buffer (80% formamide, 10 mM Na2EDTA, pH 8.0, and 1 mg/ml each bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol). Cleavage products were analyzed on a 15% polyacrylamide and 8M urea gel. Product and substrate fragments were quantitated by using NIH Imager.<br><br>Cell cultures and infection with Ad-GFP/Rz-IGF2R and Ad-GFP
Cardiac myocytes were isolated from 1-day-old newborn <span class="yellow">rats</span> using the Neonatal Cardiomyocyte Isolation System (Worthington). The isolated cells were plated in 6-well plates and cultured in F-10 medium containing 5% (vol/vol) FBS and 10% (vol/vol) <span class="blue">horse</span> serum at 37°C in a tissue culture incubator with 5% CO2 and 98% relative humidity. Cells were used for experiments after 2–3 days of culture. Viral infections were carried out by adding viral particles at various concentrations (usually, 2 × 108 virus particles/ml) to culture medium containing 2% (vol/vol) FBS. Initially, optimal viral concentration was determined by using Ad-GFP to achieve an optimal balance of high gene expression and low viral titer to minimize cytotoxicity. After 24 hours of incubation, the infection medium was replaced with normal (15% vol/vol serum) culture medium. For treatment with IGF-II, cells were incubated with 50 ng/ml IGF-II after 24 hours infection with Ad-GFP/IGF2R-Rz or Ad-GFP. Four days after infection, cells were used for analysis of gene expression of M6P/IGF2R and its effect on cell growth and apoptosis.<br><br>Analysis of gene expression in cardiac myocytes
The M6P/IGF2R transcripts were determined by both RT-PCR and Ribonuclease Protection Assay (RPA). RT-PCR was performed using the GeneAmp EZ rTth RNA PCR kit (Roche). Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using an RNA isolation kit (Qiagen,), according to the manufacturer's protocol. M6P/IGF2R transcripts were amplified using the primers (5'-GACAGGCTCGTTCTGACTTA-3') and (5'-CTTCCACTCTTATCCACAGC-3') specific to the M6P/IGF2R. Each RT-PCR assay was performed in triplicate and product levels varied by less than 3.2% for each RNA sample. Primers specific for β-actin cDNA were added to a parallel reaction to standardize for variations in PCR between samples. PCR products were resolved on a 1.0% agarose gel, visualized under UV light and quantitated using NIH Imager.
RPA was performed using the RPA III kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Briefly, total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using a total RNA isolation reagent (TRIzol, Gibco BRL) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The plasmid containing the <span class="yellow">rat</span> M6P/IGF2R gene was linearized and used as a transcription template. Antisense RNA probes were transcribed in vitro using [33P]-UTP, T7 polymerase (Riboprobea System T7 kit, Promega), hybridized with the total RNA extracted from the <span class="yellow">rat</span> cardiomyocytes, and digested with ribonuclease to remove non-hybridized RNA and probe. The protected RNA·RNA was resolved on a denaturing 5% sequence gel and subjected to autoradiography. A probe targeting the GAPDH gene was used as an internal control.<br><br>Measurement of 125I-IGF-II internalization
Cells were incubated at 37°C for 2 hrs in serum-free F-10 culture medium containing 125I-labeled IGF-II (0.5 ng/ml) with or without excess unlabeled IGF-II (2 μg/ml). Following the incubation, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and cell-associated radioactivity was determined by a γ counter. Specific internalized 125I-IGF-II was calculated by subtracting the count of samples with excessive unlabeled IGF-II from that without unlabeled IGF-II, and normalized to protein contents.<br><br>Beta-glucuronidase binding assay
Binding of β-glucuronidase was assayed as described previously [34,35]. Briefly, cells were permeabilized with 0.25% saponin in 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.5% <span class="yellow">human</span> serum albumin, and 10 mM mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) for 30 minutes on ice. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 0.05% saponin. They were incubated with 20,000 units/ml β-glucuronidase from <span class="yellow">bovine</span> liver (Sigma) in 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.5) containing 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.5% <span class="yellow">human</span> serum albumin, 0.5% saponin with or without 10 mM M6P overnight on ice. Cells were washed five times with ice-cold PBS containing 0.05% saponin and sonicated in 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.6). The protein concentration of solubilized cell extract was measured and enzyme activity was assayed as follows: for each reaction 50 ul cell extract were added to 500 ul of 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.0) containing 1 mM paranitrophenyl (PNP)-β-glucuronide (Sigma) as substrate. After an incubation period of 3 hours at 37°C, 500 ul 1 M Na2CO3 were added to each reaction and the absorbance was measured at 400 nm. Experimental values were compared to a standard curve that was constructed using 1–100 nM solutions of PNP (Sigma) in 500 ul 100 mM sodium acetate and 500 u1 1 M Na2CO3. Specific activity was calculated as nM of PNP produced/hour/mg of protein.<br><br>Beta-glucuronidase endocytosis assay
Beta-glucuronidase endocytosis assay was carried out as described previously [36]. Briefly, confluent cell cultures were washed twice with pre-warmed serum-free DMEM followed by incubation with DMEM containing 5 mg/ml <span class="yellow">human</span> serum albumin and 10 mM M6P for 20 minutes. Following incubation cells were washed 3 times with pre-warmed DMEM. Cells were then incubated in DMEM containing 5 mg/ml <span class="yellow">human</span> serum albumin alone or 4000 units β-glucuronidase with or without 10 mM M6P for 2 hours at 37°C. Following the incubation, the cells were washed 5 times with ice-cold PBS and subjected to enzyme activity assay as described above.<br><br>Cell proliferation assay (MTT assay and cell counts)
Cardiac myocytes were grown in culture plates (tissue culture grade, 12 wells, flat bottom) in a final volume of 1 ml serum-containing culture medium per well, in a humidified atmosphere (37°C and 5% C02) for 3 days. After infection with Ad-GFP/IGF2R-Rz or Ad-GFP, cells were incubated with or without 50 ng/ml IGF-II for 4 days. Following supplementation with IGF-II, 100 μl MTT labeling reagent (Roche) were added to each well and cells were incubated for 4 hours, followed by addition of 1 ml solubilization solution into each well. The plate was placed in an incubator at 37°C overnight. Spectrophotometrical absorbency of the samples was measured using an UV-visible Recording Spectrophotometer with wavelength of 550–690 nm. In addition, the total number of viable cells in each treatment was counted by trypan blue exclusion method using a hemocytometer.<br><br>Induction and analysis of cell apoptosis
Cells were infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-GFP/IGF2R-Rz. Seventy-two hours post infection, cells were treated with TNF (0.1 ng/ml) for 24 hrs or subjected to hypoxia. For induction of apoptosis by hypoxia, cell culture medium was changed to serum-free F-10 saturated with 95% N2/5% CO2 and cells were placed in a 37°C airtight box saturated with 95% N2/5% CO2 for 24 hrs. For normoxic controls, culture medium was changed to F-10/5%F BS/10% HS and cells were placed in a 37°C/5% CO2 incubator for 24 hrs before analysis.
Apoptotic cells were identified by Hoechst staining using the Vybrant™ Apoptosis Kit #5 (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In addition, after infection with Ad-GFP or Ad-GFP/IGF2R-Rz and challenge with either TNF or hypoxia, cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and cell apoptosis was determined using the Cell Death Detection ELISA Kit assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol.<br><br>Statistical analysis
Students' t-test was used to evaluate the difference between two values. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Statistical significance was accepted at the level of p < 0.05.<br><br>

<h3>pmcA1805739</h3>Embryonic sympathoblasts transiently express TrkB in vivo and proliferate in response to brain-derived neurotrophic factor in vitro
Abstract
Background
Nerve growth factor and neurotrophin-3 are involved in the development of sympathetic neurons; however, whether brain derived neurotrophic factor also plays a role is not known. The purpose of this study was to determine whether BDNF and its receptor, TrkB, are expressed during the development of paravertebral sympathetic ganglia in vivo and to determine the effect of BDNF in vitro.<br><br>Results
As neural crest cells coalesce to form sympathetic ganglia, TrkB-positive cells are seen in both <span class="yellow">chicken</span> and <span class="yellow">mouse</span> embryos. In <span class="yellow">chicken</span> embryos, TrkB-expressing cells first appear at Hamburger-Hamilton Stage (St) 27 and they co-express HNK-1, confirming that they are migrating neural crest cells. The TrkB-positive cells lack neural markers at this stage; however, they migrate with other neurally differentiating cells that are TrkA and TrkC-positive. By St. 29/30, TrkB-positive cells begin to express the neural specific markers Hu C/D and Islet-1; eventually, all TrkB positive cells commence neural differentiation. By St. 34, TrkB and TrkC staining are lost. BDNF transcript expression parallels that of TrkB. In the <span class="yellow">mouse</span>, TrkB-positive cells surround newly formed sympathetic ganglia and a small number of TrkB positive cells that co-express tyrosine hydroxylase are seen within ganglia between E13.5-15. In cell culture, many cells from St. 29–30 <span class="yellow">chicken</span> lumbar sympathetic ganglia express neural markers and are dividing, indicating that they are sympathoblasts. Sympathoblasts and neurons require both nerve growth factor and neurotrophin-3 for survival. BDNF increases the number of cells expressing neural markers in culture by increasing number of cells that incorporate bromodeoxyuridine. In contrast, most TrkB-positive sympathetic cells in vivo are not actively proliferating between E6–E8.<br><br>Conclusion
Developing paravertebral sympathetic ganglia in avian and <span class="yellow">murine</span> embryos contain a subpopulation of sympathoblasts that transiently express TrkB and ultimately commence neuronal differentiation. These TrkB expressing sympathoblasts are not actively dividing in vivo; yet, when placed in vitro, will divide in response to BDNF. This suggests that the availability of BDNF in vivo fails to reach a threshold necessary to induce proliferation. We suggest that excess TrkB stimulation of sympathoblasts in vivo may lead to the genesis of neuroblastoma.<br><br><br><br>Background
Neural crest cells destined to become paravertebral sympathetic neurons proliferate and differentiate during migration and gangliogenesis. In <span class="yellow">chicken</span> embryos, migrating neural crest cells express catecholamines at Hamburger/Hamilton Stage (St.) 19, and these cells form the primary sympathetic chain dorsolateral to the aorta at St. 22 (E3.5) [1]. Between St. 23 (E4) and St. 28 (E6), these cells disperse and undergo a secondary migration to form the paravertebral sympathetic chain that resides ventral to the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion [1]. After ganglia coalesce, sympathoblasts express markers of neuronal differentiation, such as Q211 and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), at a time when they also incorporate [3H]-thymidine [2]. Time lapse photography has shown that cultured E15.5–E16.5 sympathetic neurons from <span class="yellow">rat</span> embryos extend axons while they divide [3-5]. Although proliferation appears to be an important process to expand the sympathetic neuron population during differentiation, the mechanisms that guide sympathoblast proliferation have not been identified.
The development of sympathetic neurons is guided by neurotrophins. Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) binds to its receptor, TrkC, to promote the survival of cultured sympathoblasts from early lumbar paravertebral ganglia [6]. Nerve growth factor (NGF) signals through its receptor, TrkA, to promote the survival of sympathetic neurons upon target innervation [7]. There are severe sympathetic defects in the superior cervical ganglion of individual NT-3 and NGF knockout <span class="yellow">mice</span> [8-10]. Furthermore, there is no additional cell death in the superior cervical ganglion of NT-3 and NGF double knockout <span class="yellow">mouse</span> embryos, suggesting that all of the neurons are dependent on both neurotrophins for survival [11]. There is also an increase in sympathetic neuron cell death in TrkA knockout <span class="yellow">mice</span> [12]. However, in TrkB and BDNF knockout <span class="yellow">mice</span>, there is no apparent phenotype in the superior cervical ganglion, and there is little evidence that TrkB or BDNF is expressed in sympathetic ganglia. Thus, it is generally thought that TrkB and BDNF have little or no roles in guiding the development of sympathetic neurons.
In addition to their developmental functions, neurotrophin receptors regulate cell behavior in neuroblastoma, a tumor found in sympathetic ganglia and adrenal medulla. Tumors that express TrkA often spontaneously regress, while those that express TrkB and its ligand, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), grow aggressively, are invasive, and fail to respond to chemotherapeutic agents [13]. The presence of TrkA in neuroblastoma tumors is consistent with its expression in developing sympathetic neurons, and suggests that regressive neuroblastoma tumors arise from early sympathetic neurons that express TrkA. The function of TrkB in early sympathetic development is unknown, which makes understanding the etiology of aggressive neuroblastoma tumors difficult. Based on its function in neuroblastoma tumors, we hypothesize that BDNF and TrkB expression in differentiating sympathoblasts is responsible for expanding the neuronal population through proliferation.
We sought to determine whether BDNF and TrkB are involved in sympathetic development. We report that during early embryonic development, TrkB is expressed in a subset of differentiating sympathoblasts in both avian and <span class="yellow">murine</span> embryos. We also find that BDNF promotes the proliferation of TrkB-positive sympathoblasts in cell culture. However, the majority of TrkB positive cells in vivo fail to take up bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) over a 24 hr period, suggesting that endogenous BDNF concentrations do not reach a threshold necessary to stimulate proliferation of sympathoblasts. Shortly after all of the TrkB positive cells commence neuronal differentiation, TrkB immunoreactivity is lost. These results suggest that prolonged expression and/or activation of TrkB signaling at these early stages may be an early event triggering the formation of neuroblastoma.<br><br>Results
TrkB is expressed during migration of neural crest cells to sympathetic ganglia
We first determined whether TrkB is expressed in neural crest-derived cells in the region ventral to the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia where sympathetic ganglia coalesce between Hamburger/Hamilton Stages (St.) 25–28/29. To identify cells that have commenced neuronal differentiation, transverse sections of the lumbar spinal column region were stained with antibodies against Hu C/D [14], a neuronal-specific RNA-binding protein, or Islet-1, a transcription factor found in sympathetic neurons [15]. We found that Hu C/D and Islet-1 are expressed in the same cells both in vivo and in vitro throughout sympathetic development. In experiments done between St. 25 and 28, Islet-1 staining appeared weaker than Hu C/D staining, and thus we used Hu C/D to identify differentiating neurons at these stages. At later stages, Islet-1 was used to facilitate the identification of neurons because of the nuclear location of its immunoreactivity.
Cells expressing Hu C/D are first detected at St. 25 ventral to the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion and lateral to the dorsal aorta (Figure 1A, 1B). By St. 26, the number of cells that express Hu C/D in this region increases dramatically (Figure 1C). TrkB-expressing cells first appear at St. 27 in the same region and are adjacent to Hu C/D-positive cells (Figure 1D, 2A, 2H). TrkB-positive cells co-localize with a neural crest marker, HNK-1 (Figures 2B, 2C, 2D). The Hu C/D-positive cells in this region are likely to be sympathetic neurons, since they appear in the region where sympathetic ganglia form and express tyrosine hydroxylase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of catecholamines (Figures 2E, 2F, 2G). At St. 28/29, the cells begin to coalesce ventral to the dorsal root ganglion and the Hu C/D-positive cells and TrkB-positive cells remain as two separate cell populations (Figure 1E); however, shortly afterwards, all of the TrkB-positive cells begin to express Islet-1 (Figure 3B) and Hu C/D (data not shown).<br><br>Developmental regulation of TrkA, TrkB, TrkC, and BDNF expression
In contrast to TrkB, the other neurotrophin receptors, TrkA and TrkC, are co-expressed in both Hu C/D-positive and Hu C/D-negative cells at St. 27 (Figures 2I, 2J). We find that approximately 30% of the Islet-1-positive cells express TrkA (Figure 3A), while 50% express TrkB (Figure 3B) and 100% express TrkC (Figure 3C) at St. 29/30 (E6.5). Thus, all developing neurons express TrkC in combination with either TrkA or TrkB. By St. 31 (E7), the number of TrkA-positive, Islet-1-positive cells increases to 100% (Figure 3D) and immunoreactivities for both TrkB and TrkC appear dispersed (Figure 3E, 3F). By St. 34 (E8), TrkA expression is well-sustained (Figure 3G) and TrkB and TrkC immunoreactivities are lost (Figure 3H, 3I). We also examined the early development of <span class="yellow">murine</span> sympathetic ganglia (Figure 4). At E13, the newly formed lumbar sympathetic ganglia can be observed ventral to the spinal cord and notochord by their staining for Hu C/D and TH (Figure 4A). TrkB-positive cells can be seen surrounding developing ganglia, as well as in occasional cells within the ganglia (Figure 4C, D). These TrkB-positive cells within the ganglia co-express TH and are seen at a frequency of 1–2 cells per section starting at E13 (Figure 4A–D) and are still present at E15.5 (data not shown).
In neuroblastoma cells, BDNF is co-expressed with TrkB, suggesting that autocrine stimulation is a means by which proliferation is sustained in the transformed cells. To test whether BDNF, the ligand for TrkB, was present in embryonic <span class="yellow">chick</span> sympathetic ganglia, we used quantitative real-time PCR with TaqMan probes to determine the relative abundance of BDNF transcripts in total RNA extracted from lumbar sympathetic ganglia at St. 29/30 (E6.5), St. 31 (E7), St. 34 (E8), and E9. BDNF expression within the ganglia parallels that of TrkB: BDNF mRNA expression levels are highest at St 29/30 (E6.5), and these levels decrease 2-fold at St. 31 (E7) and St. 34 (E8; Figure 5). By E9, BDNF levels are 7 times lower than at St. 29/30 (E6.5; Figure 5).<br><br>NT3 and NGF promote survival of differentiating sympathetic neurons in culture
To determine the effect of neurotrophins, we cultured cells dispersed from lumbar sympathetic ganglia at St. 29/30 (E6.5) because, at this stage, ganglion formation is complete, the number of TrkA-, TrkB-, and TrkC-positive cells have peaked, and all Trk-expressing cells have initiated neural differentiation. First, we identified markers expressed by acutely isolated cells. As shown in Table 1, 80–91% of the cells are p75 neurotrophin receptor (NTR)-positive, indicating that most of the cells are neural crest-derived and little mesenchymal contamination is introduced by the isolation procedure. In addition, 28–33% of the cultured cells express the neural marker Hu C/D. Approximately half of these Hu C/D-positive cells express TrkB. Conversely, all of the TrkB positive cells express Hu C/D. These TrkB-positive cells comprise approximately 14–17% of the total cell population.
We then determined how many of the acutely isolated cells were proliferating by incubating them for 12 hrs in BrdU-containing medium. For these experiments, we identified differentiating neurons with the transcription factor Islet-1 because this marker labels nuclei, thus it co localizes with any BrdU that has been incorporated into the DNA, allowing us to determine whether the cell had undergone S-phase of the cell cycle. After 12 hrs in BrdU, 59% of Islet-1-positive nuclei stain for BrdU immunoreactivity. Thus, cultures of St. 29/30 sympathetic ganglia contain many cells that proliferate while exhibiting markers of neuronal differentiation, confirming previous observations [2]. We call these dividing neuronal precursors sympathoblasts. The remaining non-BrdU incorporating, Islet-1 positive cells are likely to be post mitotic neurons.
Finally, we determined the trophic requirements of St. 29/30 (E6.5) sympathetic neurons and sympathoblasts. We monitored cultures over a three day period after plating and counted the number of phase bright cells with neurites, a morphological feature of both neurons and sympathoblasts. In the absence of trophic factors, more than 2/3 of the cells die by 24 hours in culture and BDNF, NT-3, or NGF alone is not sufficient to promote survival (Figure 6). However, NGF together with NT-3 supports the survival of a significantly larger number of cells (Figure 6). For the subsequent experiments, all neurons were cultured with 25 ng/ml NT-3 and 1 μg/ml 7S NGF to optimize survival.<br><br>BDNF promotes proliferation of TrkB-positive sympathetic neurons in culture
To determine the effects of BDNF, cultures of cells from St. 29/30 (E6.5) sympathetic ganglia were supplemented with 200 ng/ml BDNF and the number of neurons and sympathoblasts were counted at 24, 48, and 72 hours using phase microscopy (Figure 7A). A 1.6-fold increase in the number of neurons due to BDNF is observed by 24 hours and this number does not increase further at 48 or 72 hours. This effect of BDNF is concentration-dependent with an EC50 of 75 ng/ml (Figure 7B).
To test whether the increase in the number of neurons and sympathoblasts caused by BDNF is due to the differentiation of pluripotent neural crest cells, we quantified the effects of BDNF on the number of neurally differentiating cells (Hu C/D-positive) versus the number of non-neuronal cells (Hu C/D-negative) after identifying all neural crest-derived cells by staining for p75NTR in St. 29/30 (E6.5) cultures. If BDNF increases the number of neurons and sympathoblasts by inducing a non-neuronal cell to express Hu C/D, then we expected that the total cell number would remain the same and that there would be a decrease in the number of non-neuronal cells as well as a corresponding increase in the number of neurons. After 24 hours, BDNF significantly increases the number of p75NTR-positive cells as well as the number of Hu C/D-positive cells (Figure 8A). However, there was no statistically significant change in the number of non-neuronal cells. Thus, it is unlikely that BDNF increases the number of neurons and sympathoblasts by inducing differentiation of non-neuronal cells.
To determine whether the increase in the total number of neurons and sympathoblasts is caused by BDNF-induced proliferation, control and BDNF-treated sympathetic cultures were exposed to BrdU for 12 hours after plating, and the number of cells that incorporated BrdU into their DNA was determined after 24 hours in culture. Even in the control condition, a number of cells in the culture are dividing, giving a high baseline of BrdU incorporation (Figure 8B). When BDNF is added, the total number of BrdU positive cells increases approximately 1.6-fold (Figure 8B). This BDNF-induced increase in the total number of BrdU positive cells occurs in sympathoblasts because the number of Islet-1-positive nuclei from control cultures that label with BrdU is 268 ± 59 and BDNF treatment raises this number to 424 ± 80, which corresponds to an increase of 1.6-fold. This accounts for the 1.6-fold increase in total neuron number and total BrdU-positive cells described above. We then confirmed that BDNF acts on TrkB-positive cells: BDNF increases the number of TrkB-expressing cells that incorporate BrdU 2.6 – 4-fold over control (Table 2) and it also increases the overall number of TrkB-positive cells 2 – 2.5-fold over control (Table 2). BDNF does not increase the number of BrdU-positive, TrkB-negative cells or the overall number of TrkB-negative cells (Table 2). In further support that BDNF acts directly on TrkB-expressing cells, an antibody directed against the extracellular domain of TrkB completely prevents the effect of BDNF in promoting proliferation of TrkB-positive, but not TrkB-negative cells (compare Figure 9A to 9B). Thus, the effect of BDNF is restricted to the population that expresses TrkB, which are developing sympathoblasts.
To determine whether TrkB-positive cells are actively proliferating in vivo, embryos were injected with BrdU at St. 27 and harvested at St. 29, approximately 24 hrs later. The majority (85–90%) of TrkB-positive cells do not incorporate BrdU into their nuclei under basal conditions in vivo (Figure 10), although a few TrkB positive cells with labeled nuclei could be observed (arrows). This contrasts with our observation that 71–76% of TrkB-positive cells incorporate BrdU in culture after treatment with BDNF (Table 2), suggesting that endogenous BDNF does not achieve a threshold sufficient to support a high level of sympathoblast proliferation in vivo.<br><br>
Discussion
We report that the neurotrophin receptor TrkB is expressed in a subset of embryonic sympathoblasts during the early development of lumbar paravertebral sympathetic ganglia in <span class="yellow">chicken</span> and <span class="yellow">mouse</span> embryos. In the <span class="yellow">chicken</span>, TrkB expression is transient, and completely lost by St 34 (E8). Since BDNF induces the proliferation of sympathoblasts in cell culture, yet in vivo there is little proliferation observed in TrkB-positive cells in nascent ganglia, we propose that if TrkB activation becomes unregulated by excess BDNF or constitutive phosphorylation of TrkB [16], this transient population of TrkB-positive sympathoblasts may trigger the genesis of neuroblastoma, a childhood tumor found in the paravertebral chain and adrenal medulla.
The two populations of sympathoblasts that we observe support previous findings of heterogeneity among developing sympathetic neurons and neural crest cells. Early sympathetic ganglia contain at least two subpopulations: early differentiating neurons that lack TrkB expression and express TrkA and TrkC, and late differentiating sympathoblasts that express TrkB. Explant cultures of sympathetic ganglia from E16 <span class="yellow">chick</span> embryos give rise to two neuronal populations: one that remains close to the explant, and one that migrates away from the explant [1]. In addition, early neuronal subpopulations have been observed in cultures of neural crest cells from St. 13/14 quail embryos as evidenced by the expression of neuronal cell type-specific gangliosides [17]. Perhaps these different subpopulations will ultimately give rise to the two neurochemically distinct populations found in lumbar sympathetic ganglia: the noradrenergic, NPY-containing neurons that innervate internal organs and enteric ganglia and the cholinergic, VIP-containing neurons that innervate vasculature in the hind limbs.
The effects of BDNF and TrkB deletion and over expression have been studied on superior cervical ganglion and preganglionic neurons in thoracic segments of the spinal column, but not on paravertebral sympathetic neurons. In the superior cervical ganglion, an increase in the number of neurons of BDNF null <span class="yellow">mice</span> is likely due to apoptosis induced by BDNF via p75NTR [18]. In contrast, the responses of paravertebral sympathetic neurons to BDNF are complex and subtype dependent. Over expression of BDNF leads to an increase in the number of noradrenergic fibers innervating the erector pilli muscles of hair follicles, while noradrenergic fibers innervating blood vessels were unaffected [19]. If our results indicating that BDNF promotes proliferation of TrkB-positive sympathoblasts in the <span class="yellow">chicken</span> embryo can be extrapolated to the subset of TrkB-positive sympathoblasts in <span class="yellow">murine</span> ganglia, then these TrkB-positive cells may be neurons destined to innervate the erector pilli. In other studies, TrkB null <span class="yellow">mice</span> showed no changes in morphology or cell number in superior cervical ganglia [12] or in the intermediolateral column [20]; but this may not be predictive of a phenotype in the lumbar paravertebral chain. It is thus possible that BDNF/TrkB signaling could play a specific role in other regions of the paravertebral sympathetic chain, such as the lumbar region. However, if TrkB-positive cells are not normally actively proliferating in vivo, then it would not be surprising that the development of the paravertebral sympathetic chain is not disrupted in TrkB or BDNF null <span class="yellow">mice</span>. It may be more informative to examine <span class="yellow">mice</span> that over express BDNF on a promoter that targets expression to embryonic lumbar ganglia. Unfortunately, such <span class="yellow">mice</span> do not exist.
Our findings that the St. 29/30 (E6.5) sympathoblasts are dependent on both NT-3 and NGF for survival in culture are consistent with previous work on <span class="yellow">mouse</span> sympathoblasts from the superior cervical ganglion [11]. In these studies, NT-3 and NGF deletion separately led to a decrease in the number of sympathetic neurons at E17.5 compared to control. Deletion of both NT-3 and NGF together did not enhance cell death. In contrast, cultured <span class="yellow">rat</span> superior cervical ganglion sympathetic neurons respond to NT-3 at E14.5 and then to NGF at E19.5, although time points in between were not analyzed [6].
In addition to promoting survival, NT-3, NGF, and BDNF also induce proliferation of various neuronal precursors at different stages of development. NT-3 can promote the incorporation of [3H]-thymidine into cultured quail neural crest cells from the trunk region [21,22], Later in <span class="yellow">rat</span> sympathetic development, NT-3 supports survival of neurons, but does not promote proliferation [6], which is consistent with our results. NGF promotes an increase in BrdU incorporation from 25% to 35% in the DRG cervical segment 2 in the <span class="yellow">chick</span> embryo [23]. In <span class="yellow">chicken</span> embryos that are treated with NGF in ovo at St. 18 and 21, there is an increase in BrdU uptake after formation of the primary sympathetic chain at St. 23 [24]. Since NGF does not appear to affect proliferation of St. 29/30 (E6.5) <span class="yellow">chick</span> sympathoblasts, NGF may only promote proliferation in primary, but not secondary chain sympathoblasts. Motor neuron progenitors in the ventral neural tube from the <span class="yellow">chick</span> embryo express TrkB and when ventral neural tube explants are treated with BDNF, there is an increase in the number of motor neurons produced and BrdU incorporation [25]. BDNF also promotes the proliferation of cultured neuroblastoma cells [13]. Taken together, these results are consistent with our findings that NT-3 and NGF do not promote proliferation of St. 29/30 (E6.5) sympathoblasts, and support the assertion that BDNF promotes proliferation of TrkB-positive sympathoblasts in culture.
Our observations suggest a transient function of TrkB during early sympathetic development in supporting proliferation of this early subpopulation of sympathoblasts. However, the in vivo labeling suggests that only a minority (10–20%) of this population is dividing during the window that TrkB is expressed. In light of the very strong proliferative effect produced in cell culture, these TrkB expressing cells could respond more strongly if endogenous BDNF rises to higher levels, or if the mechanism that down regulates TrkB expression becomes nonfunctional. Such events could trigger an early proliferative event that leads to a cascade of changes that initiates transformation of cells to neuroblastoma. Thus, these early TrkB expressing cells help solve the puzzle as to why TrkB is expressed in aggressive and invasive forms of neuroblastoma, particularly because BDNF induces cultured neuroblastoma cells to become more proliferative, invasive, angiogenic, and resistant to chemotherapeutic reagents than untreated cultures [13]. Future studies will determine whether constitutive expression of BDNF and TrkB in the <span class="yellow">chick</span> embryo sustains proliferation of differentiating sympathoblasts.<br><br>Conclusion
We have identified a time point during development when differentiating lumbar sympathetic neurons transiently express TrkB and proliferate in response to high concentrations of BDNF in culture. These studies suggest that elevated BDNF expression above basal levels and signaling through TrkB may be a mechanism that contributes to the onset of neuroblastoma. A further understanding of the two populations of sympathetic neurons and the fate of the TrkB-positive cells will provide additional insight into the development of paravertebral sympathetic ganglia and the genesis of neuroblastoma.<br><br>Methods
Preparation of tissue for immunohistochemistry
The lumbar spinal column and surrounding tissues were dissected from <span class="yellow">chicken</span> embryos at the indicated stages and placed in Zamboni's fixative (4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, 15% (v/v) picric acid in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) for two hours at room temperature. <span class="yellow">Mouse</span> embryos at 13–15 days post-coitus were collected according to an IACUC-approved protocol to Dr. L. Sherman at the Oregon Health and Science University. The <span class="yellow">mouse</span> embryos were immersion-fixed in Zamboni's fixative overnight at 4 degrees C then washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 130 mM NaCl, 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). Fixed tissues were equilibrated in 30% sucrose in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Fixed <span class="yellow">mouse</span> embryos were shipped to Vermont in sucrose. Transverse 30 μM sections of the spinal columns were cut at on a Microm HM cryostat (knife temperature: 16°C; object temperature: 23°C) and collected on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher). Sections were dried at room temperature, washed in 1× PBS and incubated overnight in blocking buffer (1× PBS consisting of 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated <span class="blue">horse</span> serum (Invitrogen/Gibco), 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma), and 0.1% sodium azide (Fisher)).<br><br>Immunohistochemistry
Sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies for 2 hours at room temperature. Primary antibodies used were: <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-p75 (1:1500, generous gift from Louis Reichardt, UCSF [26]), <span class="yellow">mouse</span> IgG2b anti-Hu C/D, (1:250, Molecular Probes); <span class="yellow">mouse</span> IgG1 anti-Islet-1, (1:10, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank); <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-<span class="yellow">chicken</span> TrkA (1:500); <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-<span class="yellow">chicken</span> TrkB (1:500); <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-<span class="yellow">chicken</span> TrkC (1:500) (all Trk antibodies were generous gifts of Dr. Louis Reichardt, UCSF [26-28]); <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-HNK-1 (1:50, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank); <span class="yellow">mouse</span> IgG2a anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (1:10, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), <span class="yellow">sheep</span> anti-BrdU (1:100, Biodesign International), <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (1:100, Chemicon), and <span class="yellow">goat</span> anti-TrkB (1:1000, R&D Systems). Immunofluorescence was imaged using a Nikon C1 confocal mounted on a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope with a 10× Plan Apo (NA 0.785) air objective or a 60× Plan Apo (NA 1.4) oil objective lens, E7-C1 software, and UV, Argon, and He/Ne lasers exciting at 408, 488, and 543 nm and emitting at 404 500–530, and 555–615 nm, respectively. A Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope in the nearby COBRE Molecular/Cellular Core Facility was used for counting immunofluorescent cells at 200× using epifluorescence optics.<br><br>RNA Extraction/cDNA synthesis
Sympathetic ganglia were removed from <span class="yellow">chick</span> embryos and RNA was isolated using TriReagent (Molecular Research Center), an acidified guanidinium with phenol extraction method [29]. RNA was transcribed to cDNA using oligo-dT with Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42°C for 1 hour.<br><br>Real-time PCR
Relative RNA levels were determined using quantitative real-time PCR with an ABI 7500 Fast Real Time PCR System. TaqMan probes were used to quantify the progression of the PCR reaction and reactions were normalized using the constitutively expressed gene <span class="yellow">chick</span> ribosomal binding protein s17 (CHRPS). The sequences were used for primer/probes sets: for BDNF: forward: 5'-AGCCCAGTGAGGAAAACAAG-3', reverse: 5'-ACTCCTCGAGCAGAAAGAGC-3', probe: 5'-[6-FAM]-TACACATCCCGAGTCATGCTGAGCA-[BHQ]-3'; for CHRPS (<span class="yellow">chick</span> ribosomal binding protein S-17): 5'AACGACTTCCACACCAACAA3', reverse: 5'CTTCATCAGGTGGGTGACAT3', probe: 5'-[6-FAM]-CGCCATCATCCCCAGCAAGA [BHQ]-3'. Primers and probes were synthesized by Operon Technologies, Inc (Alameda, CA). The primers for BDNF were validated against primers for CHRPS according to an Applied BioSystems protocol by serially diluting the target cDNA 1:10, determining the cycle threshold (Ct) for each reaction, and plotting the Ct versus log concentration. Slopes of the resulting lines were calculated and primers were accepted if their Ct slopes were between -3.2 and -3.4 (a perfect efficiency of 1.0 yields a slope of -3.3). To analyze the data, the delta Ct method of relative quantification was used, where the Ct of Chrps was subtracted from the Ct of the gene of interest (Delta Ct) and the arbitrary units of mRNA were expressed as 10000/2^(Delta Ct).<br><br>Cell culture
Sympathetic neurons were cultured as previously described [30] with a few modifications. Sympathetic ganglia were removed from the lumbar region of the paravertebral chain of St. 29/30 (E6.5) <span class="yellow">chick</span> embryos and placed in Modified Puck's solution with glucose (MPG). The cells were dissociated by incubation of sympathetic ganglia with 0.1% trypsin in MPG at 37°C for 10 minutes followed by triturating with a fire polished 9" Pasteur pipette. Cells were then resuspended in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) consisting of 10% <span class="blue">horse</span> serum, 2% fetal <span class="yellow">calf</span> serum, and 10 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. For neurotrophin studies, the culture medium was supplemented with 25 ng/ml NT-3 (R & D Systems) and 1 μg/ml 7S NGF (Alomone Labs) upon plating, and 50 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml, or 200 ng/ml BDNF (R & D Systems) once the cells adhered to the wells. Cells were plated on poly-D-lysine/laminin coated wells or cover slips (Fisher) as previously described [30].<br><br>Quantification of neurons and sympathoblasts using phase microscopy
Embryonic sympathoblasts and neurons are small, phase bright cells with neurites. The total number of cells with neurites the length of two cell bodies were counted in 10 non-overlapping fields of view evenly spaced in a grid-like pattern across the bottom of a well from a 24 well plate at 200× using a Nikon Eclipse TE200 microscope.<br><br>BrdU labeling
For in vitro studies, approximately 2 hours after plating cells from St. 29/30 (E6.5) sympathetic ganglia, cells were labeled with 10 μM bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, Sigma) for 12 hours at 37°C. Following this labeling period, cells were incubated in complete medium without BrdU for an additional 10 hrs. Cells were then fixed in Zamboni's fixative for 30 min at room temperature and rinsed with 1× PBS. For in vivo studies, 25 μg BrdU was injected into the amnion of <span class="yellow">chick</span> embryos at St. 27. The cells and sections were denatured with 2 N HCl at 37°C for 1 hr, and were then neutralized with 0.1 M borate buffer, pH 8.5, for 10 min at room temperature. Immunochemistry was performed as described above.<br><br>

<h3>pmcA2435603</h3>Potentiation of Nerve Growth Factor-Induced Neurite Outgrowth by Fluvoxamine: Role of Sigma-1 Receptors, IP3 Receptors and Cellular Signaling Pathways
Abstract
Background
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been widely used and are a major therapeutic advance in psychopharmacology. However, their pharmacology is quite heterogeneous. The SSRI fluvoxamine, with sigma-1 receptor agonism, is shown to potentiate nerve-growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite outgrowth in PC 12 cells. However, the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying potentiation by fluvoxamine are not fully understood. In this study, we examined the roles of cellular signaling pathways in the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by fluvoxamine and sigma-1 receptor agonists.<br><br>Methods and Findings
The effects of three SSRIs (fluvoxamine, sertraline, paroxetine) and three sigma-1 receptor agonists (SA4503, 4-phenyl-1-(4-phenylbutyl) piperidine (PPBP), and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-sulfate) on NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells were examined. Also examined were the effects of the sigma-1 receptor antagonist NE-100, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptor antagonist, and specific inhibitors of signaling pathways in the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by selective sigma-1 receptor agonist SA4503. Fluvoxamine (but not sertraline or paroxetine) and the sigma-1 receptor agonists SA4503, PPBP, and DHEA-sulfate significantly potentiated NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The potentiation by fluvoxamine and the three sigma-1 receptor agonists was blocked by co-administration of the selective sigma-1 receptor antagonist NE-100, suggesting that sigma-1 receptors play a role in blocking the enhancement of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Moreover, the potentiation by SA4503 was blocked by co-administration of the IP3 receptor antagonist xestospongin C. In addition, the specific inhibitors of phospholipase C (PLC-γ), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), p38MAPK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways blocked the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503.<br><br>Conclusion
These findings suggest that stimulation of sigma-1 receptors and subsequent interaction with IP3 receptors, PLC-γ, PI3K, p38MAPK, JNK, and the Ras/Raf/MAPK signaling pathways are involved in the mechanisms of action of sigma-1 receptor agonists such as fluvoxamine and SA4503.<br><br><br><br>Introduction
Selective serotonin (5-HT; 5-hydroxytryptamine) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have emerged as a major therapeutic advance in psychopharmacology. SSRIs are the treatment of choice for many indications, including major depressive disorder, dysthymia, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. In contrast, it is well known that their pharmacology is quite heterogeneous, although all of them block 5-HT transporters, thus increasing 5-HT levels throughout the central nervous system (CNS) [1]–[9].
Accumulating evidence suggests that sigma-1 receptors, which are intracellular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins, are involved in both the neuroplasticity and pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric diseases such as major depressive disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease [10]–[18]. Previously, we reported that some SSRIs possess high to moderate affinities for sigma-1 receptors in the <span class="yellow">rat</span> brain. The rank order of SSRIs affinities for sigma-1 receptors is fluvoxamine (Ki = 36 nM)>sertraline (Ki = 57 nM)>>paroxetine (Ki = 1893 nM) [19]. Recently, we reported that fluvoxamine, but not paroxetine, significantly ameliorated cognitive deficits in <span class="yellow">mice</span> after repeated phencyclidine administration, and that the effects of fluvoxamine were antagonized by co-administration of the selective sigma-1 receptor antagonist NE-100 [20], suggesting that sigma-1 receptors are involved in the mechanism of action of fluvoxamine [9]. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that sigma-1 receptor agonists including fluvoxamine could potentiate nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, and that NE-100 blocked the potentiation by sigma-1 receptor agonists, suggesting sigma-1 receptors are involved in neuroplasticity [21]. However, the precise cellular mechanisms underlying the potentiation by sigma-1 receptor agonists are not fully understood [13], [21].
It is therefore of great interest to study the precise cellular mechanisms underlying the enhancement by fluvoxamine on NGF-induced neurite sprouting in PC12 cells. In the present study, we examined the effects of three SSRIs (fluvoxamine, sertraline, paroxetine), as well as the effects of a sigma-1 receptor agonist (4-phenyl-1-(4-phenylbutyl) piperidine (PPBP), dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEA)-sulfate) [9], [22]–[28] and the selective sigma-1 receptor agonist SA4503 [29], [30], on NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Furthermore, it is also known that sigma-1 receptors have been shown to interact with IP3 receptors (17,18). Therefore, we examined the effects of NE-100 and xestospongin C (a selective inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptor antagonist) [31] in order to investigate the roles of sigma-1 receptors and IP3 receptors in the mechanisms underlying the enhancement of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503. Moreover, we examined the effects of specific inhibitors of several cellular signaling targets on the enhancement of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503, since several signal transduction molecules have been implicated in NGF-induced neurite outgrowth [32].<br><br>Materials and Methods
Drugs
The drugs were obtained from the following sources: fluvoxamine maleate (Solvay Seiyaku K.K., Tokyo, Japan); paroxetine hydrochloride, dehydroepiandosterone-sulfate (DHEA-sulfate), LY294002 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA); sertraline (Toronto Research Chemicals Inc., North York, ON, Canada); SA4503 (M's Science Corporation, Kobe, Japan); NGF (Promega, Madison, WI); xestospongin C, lovastatin, PD98059, GW5074, SB203580, MEK 1/2 inhibitor (SL327), and SP600125 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem, San Diego, CA). The selective sigma-1 receptor antagonists NE-100 and 4-phenyl-1-(4-phenylbutyl) piperidine (PPBP) were synthesized in our laboratory. Other drugs were purchased from commercial sources.<br><br>Cell culture
PC12 sells (RIKEN Cell Bank, Tsukuba, Japan) were cultured at 37°C, 5% CO2 with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal <span class="yellow">bovine</span> serum (FBS), 10% heat-inactivated <span class="blue">horse</span> serum, and 1% penicillin. The medium was changed two or three times a week. PC12 cells were plated onto 24-well tissue culture plates coated with poly-D-lysine/laminin. Cells were plated at relatively low density (0.25×104 cells/cm2) in DMEM medium containing 0.5% FBS, 1% penicillin streptomycin. Medium containing a minimal level of serum (0.5% FBS) was used, since serum is known to contain steroid hormones that bind to sigma-1 receptors [21]. First, we examined the optimal concentration of NGF for NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. NGF (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40 ng/ml) increased the number of cells with neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 1). In the subsequent studies, 2.5 ng/ml of NGF was used to study the potentiating effects of sigma-1 receptor agonists on NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Twenty-four hours after plating, the medium was replaced with DMEM medium containing 0.5% FBS and 1% penicillin streptomycin with NGF (2.5 ng/ml) with or without several drugs.<br><br>Quantification of neurite sprouting
Five days after incubation with NGF (2.5 ng/ml) with or without the several drugs, morphometric analysis was performed on digitized images of live cells taken under phase-contrast illumination with an inverted microscope linked to a camera. Images of three fields per well were taken, with an average of 100 cells per field. Differentiated cells were counted by visual examination of the field; only cells that had at least one neurite with a length equal to the cell body diameter were counted, and were then expressed as a percentage of the total cells in the field. The counting was performed in a blinded manner.<br><br>Immunocytochemistry
Cells were fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton and blocked with 1.5% normal <span class="yellow">goat</span> serum, 0.1% <span class="yellow">bovine</span> serum albumin (BSA) in 0.1 M phosphate-buffer saline for 1 h to reduce nonspecific binding. Cells were incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) antibodies (1∶1000 dilution in blocking solution, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA, USA). The immunolabeling was visualized with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa-488 (1∶1000; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). MAP-2 immuncytochemistry was visualized with a fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 200, Carl Zeiss, Oberkocken, Germany).<br><br>Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as means±S.E.M. Statistical analysis was performed by using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the post hoc Bonferroni/Dunn test. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.<br><br>
Results
Effects of SSRIs on NGF-induced neurite outgrowth
Fluvoxamine (0.1, 1.0, or 10 µM) significantly increased the number of cells with neurite outgrowth by NGF (2.5 ng/ml) in PC12 cells, in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 2 and 4). In contrast, sertraline (0.1, 1.0, or 10 µM) and paroxetine (0.1, 1.0, or 10 µM) did not increase the number of cells with neurite outgrowth by NGF (2.5 ng/ml). A higher concentration (10 µM) of paroxetine and sertraline significantly decreased the number of cells with NGF-induced neurite outgrowth, suggesting the cellular toxicity of these drugs in PC12 cells (Figure 2).<br><br>Role of sigma-1 receptors in the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by fluvoxamine and SA4503
The selective and potent sigma-1 receptor agonist SA4503 (0.01, 0.1, or 1.0 µM) significantly increased the number of cells with neurite outgrowth by NGF (2.5 ng/ml) in PC12 cells, in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 3 and 4). In addition, other sigma-1 receptor agonists–PPBP (0.1, 1.0, or 10 µM) [22]–[26] and DHEA-sulphate (0.1, 1.0, or 10 µM) [9], [27], [28]–significantly increased the number of such cells, also in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 3). In the absence of NGF, sigma-1 receptor agonists did not produce neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (data not shown).
To investigate the role of sigma-1 receptors, we examined the effects of NE-100 (a selective sigma-1 receptor antagonist) on the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by fluvoxamine, SA4503, PPBP, and DHEA-sulphate. Co-administration of NE-100 (1.0 µM) significantly blocked such potentiation by fluvoxamine (10 µM), SA4503 (1.0 µM), PPBP (10 µM), or DHEA-sulphate (10 µM) (Figure 2 and 3). Furthermore, administration of NE-100 (1.0 µM) alone did not alter NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (Figure 2).<br><br>Role of IP3 receptors in the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503
Sigma-1 receptors have been shown to interact with IP3 receptors (17,18,33–35). To investigate the role of IP3 receptors in the effects of SA4503 on NGF-induced neurite outgrowth, we examined the effects of xestospongin C (a selective, reversible, and membrane-permeable inhibitor of IP3 receptors) [31] on the effects of SA4503 on NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Co-administration of xestospongin C (1.0 µM) significantly blocked the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503 (1.0 µM) (Figure 5). Furthermore, administration of xestospongin C (1.0 µM) alone did not alter NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (Figure 5).<br><br>Role of signaling molecules proximal to TrkA in the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503
Next, we examined the effects of the specific inhibitors of PLC-γ, PI3K, p38 MAPK, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), since these signaling molecules are activated upon the addition of NGF [36]. The PLC-γ inhibitor (U73122; 1.0 µM), PI3K inhibitor (LY294002; 1.0 µM), p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580; 1.0 µM), and JNK inhibitor (SP600125; 1.0 µM) significantly blocked the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503 (1.0 µM) (Figure 6). In contrast, these inhibitors alone did not alter NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (Figure 6).<br><br>Role of Raf/Ras/ERK/MAPK pathway in the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503
The Raf/Ras/ERK/MAPK pathway is known to be involved in NGF-induced outgrowth [32]. Therefore, we examined the effects of this pathway's specific inhibitors. The Ras inhibitor (GW5074; 1.0 µM), Raf inhibitor (lovastatin; 1.0 µM), MEK1/2 inhibitor (SL327; 1.0 µM), and MAPK inhibitor (PD98059; 1.0 µM) significantly blocked the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503 (1.0 µM) (Figure 7). In contrast, these inhibitors alone did not alter NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (Figure 7).<br><br>
Discussion
In the present study, we found that fluvoxamine (but not sertraline or paroxetine) and the sigma-1 receptor agonists (SA4503, PPBP, DHEA-sulfate) could potentiate NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, and that the effects of these drugs were blocked by co-incubation with the selective sigma-1 receptor antagonist NE-100. These findings suggest that agonism at sigma-1 receptors for these drugs is involved in the mechanisms underlying the drugs' potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth.
As shown in Figure 1, NGF increased the number of cells with neurite outgrowth in PC12, in a concentration dependent manner. To examine whether or not the NGF levels are altered by incubation with sigma-1 receptor agonists, we measured the levels of NGF in PC12 cells with or without sigma-1 receptor agonist SA4503. No differences of NGF levels were shown in the between control group and SA4503-treated group (data not shown). It is, therefore, unlikely that the potentaition of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by sigma-1 receptor agonists might be due to increased levels of NGF.
Unlike fluvoxamine, sertraline, which has a moderate affinity for sigma-1 receptors, did not alter NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. The reasons underlying this discrepancy between these two SSRIs are currently unclear. One possibility may involve the difference in pharmacological actions (agonist vs. antagonist) between these SSRIs at sigma-1 receptors. Interestingly, we recently found that, in a novel object recognition test, phencyclidine-induced cognitive deficits could be significantly improved by subsequent subchronic (14 days) administration of fluvoxamine, but not of sertraline, suggesting that sigma-1 receptor agonism is involved in fluvoxamine's mechanism of action [9], Ishima et al., submitted. Taken together, these findings suggest that fluvoxamine and sertraline may function as an agonist and an antagonist at sigma-1 receptors, respectively, although further study is necessary. Another possibility may be that other pharmacological activities of sertraline mask the effects of sigma-1 receptor agonism. In this study, we also found that high concentration (10 µM) of paroxetine and sertraline, but not fluvoxamine, showed cytotoxicity in PC12 cells, suggesting that fluvoxamine may be a safe drug than paroxetine and sertraline.
Sigma-1 receptors have been shown to affect intracellular Ca2+ signaling, although the precise molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this effect are unknown. Sigma-1 receptors bind to IP3 receptors in ER, and sigma-1 receptors regulate Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ storage sites [12]. Very recently, Hayashi and Su [17] reported that sigma-1 receptors function as novel ligand-operated chaperones that specifically target mitochondrion-associated ER membrane. Furthermore, sigma-1 receptors form Ca2+-sensitive chaperone machinery with another chaperone, BiP, and prolong Ca2+ signaling from ER into mitochondria by stabilizing IP3 receptors at mitochondrion-associated ER membrane [17]. In this study, we found that the IP3 receptor antagonist xestospongin C significantly blocked the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503, suggesting the role of IP3 receptors on sigma-1 receptor-mediated potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Therefore, it is likely that stimulation at sigma-1 receptors by sigma-1 receptor agonists and subsequent interaction with IP3 receptors are involved in the mechanism underlying the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by sigma-1 receptor agonists.
NGF binds to the high-affinity tyrosine receptor TrkA, initiating several signaling pathways affecting both morphological and transcriptional targets [32], [36], [37]. The signaling molecules, including PLC-γ, PI3K, p38 MAPK, and JNK, are activated upon the addition of NGF [38]. PLC-γ catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3). DAG activates protein kinase C, and IP3 promotes transient release of Ca2+ from the ER [39]. The pathway via PLC-γ is responsible for NGF-induced cell differentiation [40] and neurite outgrowth [41]. Furthermore, stimulation of PI3K is reported to be involved in the promotion of neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells [42]. In this study, we found that the PLC-γ inhibitor U73122 and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 significantly blocked the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503. Moreover, we found that both the p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 significantly blocked the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503. In addition, it is also interesting that neurite outgrowth induced by low concentration (2.5 ng/ml) of NGF was not blocked by these inihibitors, consistent with a previous report [43], [44], suggesting the existence of novel pathway(s) for NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. These findings suggest that the PLC-γ, PI3K, p38MAPK, and JNK signaling pathways are involved in the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by sigma-1 receptor agonists (Figure 8). In addition, we found that the specific inhibitors for the Raf/Ras/MEK/MAPK pathways significantly blocked the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503, suggesting that these pathways are involved in the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by sigma-1 receptor agonists (Figure 8).
Our recent positron emission tomography (PET) study demonstrated that, after a single oral administration, fluvoxamine bound to sigma-1 receptors in the living <span class="yellow">human</span> brain [45]. This finding suggests that sigma-1 receptors are involved in the mechanism of action of fluvoxamine in the <span class="yellow">human</span> brain [45]. Taken together, the past and present findings suggest that, unlike paroxetine and sertraline, the SSRI fluvoxamine, with its sigma-1 receptor agonistic activity, might be a unique therapeutic drug for neuropsychiatric diseases.
In conclusion, the present results suggest that, as a sigma-1 receptor agonist, fluvoxamine could potentiate the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Furthermore, it is likely that interaction with IP3 receptors and several subsequent signaling molecules are involved in the mechanism underlying the pharmacological action of sigma-1 receptor agonists. Therefore, it is likely that sigma-1 receptor agonists such as fluvoxamine and DHEA-sulfate, which are available around the world, would be unique therapeutic drugs for neuropsychiatric diseases.<br><br>
