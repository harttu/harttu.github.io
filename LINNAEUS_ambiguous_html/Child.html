Abstract<br><br><br><br><br><br> Medical History, 1990, 34: 178-184. <br><br> IN SPITE OF MEDICAL HELP: THE PUZZLE OF AN <br><br> EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY PRIME MINISTER'S <br><br> ILLNESS <br><br> by <br><br> MARJORIE BLOY * <br><br> Charles Watson Wentworth, second Marquis of Rockingham, died suddenly and unexpectedly on 1 July 1782, when he was only 52 years old. He had suffered-or enjoyed-ill health all his life but in 1782 appeared to be no worse than he had ever been. His death in London terminated his second period of office as Prime Minister, to which he had been appointed only 14 weeks earlier. In May he had reported to the Duke of Portland that he had "for some weeks past undergone much Pain and much inconvenience from something similar to my old Complaint in my Side and Stomach" but that he felt much better than he had.' By 17 June he was recovering from both influenza and his "old complaint".2 On 1 July he died and on the 20th he was interred in York Minster. <br><br> The first recorded bout of illness suffered by the marquis, then Lord Higham, was in July 1741 when the 11-year-old was "a little indisposed, something Feaverish I guess it proceeds from Worms and will Soon be removed".3 He also had a rash and it was thought that the cause of the problem was that the <span class="yellow">boy</span> had overheated himself.4 He was still ill at the beginning of August: he had been "much out of order" for a long time but had been recommended to take warm baths by Dr Wilmot and Mr Ranby when they were consulted in London.5 Charles's aunt, Lady Isabella Finch, was sure that the baths "and other Things They'll prescribe will in a short Time entirely Cure his Complaints w[hic]h neither of Them thought proceed from any dangerous Causes".6 In spite of Lady Isabella's hopes, Charles did not greatly improve, even though his mother believed that he continued mending every day.

The doctors hoped that it would burst outwards "which they assure me will be the safest way and give the poor Monkey but very little pain' 7 <br><br> On 20 August Lord Winchelsea, Higham's uncle, surprised to see the <span class="yellow">boy</span> so well and brisk, hoped that Charles was "now safe from this complaint"-the same one from which he had suffered in 1738-39-but thought that he would never be safe "if he continues the practice of overheating himself and then drinking Cold Water". He said that Charles was of a "pretty healthy strong Constitution";8 Lady Malton was not so sure. The same day she wrote a progress report to her husband saying that Charles's swelling continued to grow, as did the pain "in that part (but not the lease [sic] trouble in making Water or going to Stool) & less Fever than c[oulJd be imagined where Matter is as they now imagine certainly gathering and must end in an operation". In spite of it all, Charles was in fine spirits.9 Lady Malton dosed the <span class="yellow">boy</span> with <span class="yellow">cinchona</span> bark, which removed the pains in his legs and reduced his fever, and she was convinced that they would soon have "a clear Stage to act in a proper manner a[bou]t his other Complaints w[hic]h the Learned assure me are to be conquered also". 10 Charles was soon allowed to eat meat and Mr Ranby still assured her that the swelling would break outwards. 1 " Three days later he decided to lance it, even though Dr Bourne disagreed. The <span class="yellow">boy</span>'s mother was puzzled because the swelling "sometimes pushes forward very fast then retires a little" but the doctor and Ranby seemed happy with his condition.'2 At this point the letters cease, presumably because Malton arrived in London with his daughters, to have them inoculated against <span class="yellow">smallpox</span>, but a later letter states that surgery to open the swelling was not undertaken. 13 <br><br> By the end of October the correspondence had recommenced. Charles was ill again. He was just the same as when he left Kensington, so John Bourne had bled him and the <span class="yellow">child</span> had started on Sir Edward Hulse's prescription, unfortunately not defined in the letter, but which was apparently as bad as the last one, if not worse. Lady Malton thought that "with such a State of Blood the Continuation of Health cannot be expected" but was hopeful that the "Cinnabar may prove a more Efficacious remedie than any than has been tryed yet""."4 That night she applied "a Blister ... without the least Symptom or tendency to anything like Strangury". He bore the treatment well, as he had done three years previously, and it seemed so successful that Lady Malton was "determined to keep it running full as long as I did last time by the help of John Borne [sic] with much ease to the Dear <span class="blue">Child</span>".'5 She <br><br> 7 WWM, M7-51.

Charles found her treatment "not near the pain he expected" and she was "full of hopes that he will rec[eiv]e great benefit from it".1 <br><br> Apart from his other troubles, one of Charles's knees had swollen but this had much abated since the application of the blisters which Lady Malton believed "must be acting upon the whole Mass of Blood" since it had "reached the remote part". She thought that Sir Edward Hulse's powders were too slow in taking effect although the <span class="yellow">boy</span> took them very quietly.'7 Sir Edward did not "apprehend any great danger from the Siziness [thickness] of Charles' blood"; Lady Malton thought that the condition was the cause of all the <span class="yellow">child</span>'s problems, which would not end until it was set to rights. At any rate, he was fit enough to go hunting.'8 Charles continued in the same state of health. He slept well at night, ate more than his mother thought was good for him, and was able to exercise strenuously without tiring. He put on no weight though, and "as for them swellings at his throat, they are almost gone one day and rise the next". His mother did not expect a speedy recovery and "if the D[octo]rs think him in a good state of health now, I s[houl]d be glad to see him in a better".'9 He began to improve and by the end of November even she thought he was on the mend and gaining weight.20 Unfortunately, Lady Malton again had cause for concern over his health in January 1742 when he began to suffer from an intermittent hoarseness.2' Otherwise he was as well as one could expect, with no other complaints.22 It was not to last. <br><br> In May 1742 Charles and his mother were again in Bristol, taking the waters because he had been indisposed. Lady Malton thought the waters were doing them good because they were both being violently sick.23 However, Charles had had no dinner on 25 or 26 May and was hot, lazy, and inclined to stir, "from which I conclude he is not well, . . . and therefore Intend to give him a gentle Vomit ... and to let him take his old Remedie the Salt Draughts for a few Daies which I dare say will set him quite to rights".24 By 29 May Dr Boume had bled the <span class="yellow">boy</span> "which succeeded very well but ... found it [his blood] as bad as ever". The waters were not working "but there is a great deal for them to do which grant God they may effect". The weather had turned warm so Lady Malton had "shorn him ... which has display'd a most scabby head and indeed several other untoward Blotches he has out upon other parts of his Body", which made her uneasy.25 The blotches on his head were not numerous "yet they made up in quality for so virulent a Corrosive Humour is not easily conceived without seeing it". The pustules on his body were of the same sort <br><br> 16 WWM, M7-17. Lady to Lord Malton, 4 November 1741. 7 WWM, M7-18. Lady to Lord Malton, 4 November 1741. 18 WWM, M7-16.

Charles was also feverish; his glands were swollen and his pulse was erratic "but out of compassion to you I must tell you that he is with me as Brisk and lively as you ever Saw him". Lady Malton had called in two eminent Bristol <span class="yellow">men</span>, Dr Logan and Mr Pye, to treat the <span class="yellow">boy</span>; Mr Pye prescribed "the Precipitate Per se" as the cure for the "hectic". Pye made it himself and said that it was the only remedy that would work. Clearly Charles was impatient to be cured because he told his mother to give him the medicine "to cure me which I am sure it will do or shoot me through the head at once". She thought that this attitude was "odd from one of his Age and [it] does not a little disturb".26 The blotches began to burst and indent but the doctor thought that all would be well in the end.27 Meanwhile, Charles was still losing weight even though "he had none to spare before" and he was inclined to be lazy which was not his natural turn. His father recommended some unknown cure which he called Gascoin's Powder-a dose of five grains made up with syrup into a pill-every night. <br><br> To make matters worse, the doctors disagreed about the treatment. "Dr Pye is Vehemently for the P. Per se, Dr Logan saies that it is a Medicine that may prove too rough in its operation for his Constitution & therefore begs a tryal of Beazor mineral [gall stones from a <span class="yellow">goat</span>] and Viper Broth". The Bristol water had not yet acted "because his case is of too obstinate a Nature" and Lady Malton herself was satisfied that since nothing else had worked to cure the <span class="yellow">boy</span>, the time had come to try mercurials, even though she knew that they were "powerful and perhaps in some cases hazardous medicines".28 She wanted to see some remedy succeed but was "afraid of violent ones and at the same time vastly distrustfull [sic] of mild ones". It would appear that the "precipitate Per se", probably mercury-based, could be a kill-or-cure remedy. Her "terrors" did not arise from any immediate danger to her son, and her "perfect Knowledge" of his disorder convinced her that whatever remedies he took, the cure was in the hands of God.29 <br><br> To add to Charles' disorders, on 12 June he developed a "very inflamed bad Eye ... the same Eye that ... he did not see so well of [as] the other ... He sais [sic] that from that eye Alone he can Scarcely distinguish anything". The doctors suggested bathing the eye: Lady Malton knew that the "frightful symptoms" which were "shocking to behold" were a result of "the Same as produces all the rest of his complaints in whichever Shape they appear". 30 The eye was very bloodshot and inflamed; the eyelid was swollen so he could hardly open it. The other eye was dull and "he had very little sight of it".31 By 14 June the eye problem had eased somewhat but Lady Malton could find no cause to attribute the improvement to any of the "cures". Charles was still being subjected to Bristol water, Beazor mineral, Viper broth, cinnabar and the precipitate per se.32 She decided to take the <span class="yellow">boy</span> home to Wentworth because he was <br><br> 26 WWM, M7-38.

The flesh he lost in the Accidental Feavour he has not Recover'd and his complexion is of the most sickly sort his hands of the same Hue his legs are tollerable [sic] well".34 <br><br> They returned to Wentworth in short stages and by 6 September Higham was "perfectly recovered . . . after the long and successful Care that Lady Malton has taken" of him.35 In May 1743 he was inoculated against <span class="yellow">smallpox</span> and made a perfect recovery after which he caught cold "by stripping when He was hot".36 Lord Higham does not seem to have been seriously ill after that until, at the age of 19, he undertook his Grand Tour in 1749. <br><br> In July 1750, by then Lord Malton, he had cause to consult Nicolo Scanagati in Padua for the treatment of gonorrhoea. Scanagati produced a lengthy medical report of Malton's treatment, presumably for his English doctor's enlightenment.37 The initial treatment was an "electuary, consisting of three ounces of emollient, three drams of powdered <span class="yellow">jalap</span>, a half [dram] of purified nitre, bound together with <span class="yellow">lemon</span> juice taken twice a day". The result was satisfactory: "The dark greenish poison was oozing slowly from his penis, which was all contracted and the sharp and constant pain extended from the perineum up to the urinary bladder, producing small swellings now in this place, now in that." There was a fierce burning sensation in the glands, which prevented him from sleeping. Because of this, it seemed reasonable to bathe that part in tepid water and milk, and to apply poultices to the areas affected by swelling and contractions, together with cold drinks and a few grains of laudanum at night. <br><br> Malton was blooded regularly besides being given purgatives; the treatment then moved on to the administration of mercury, both internal and on the gums, since it was widely believed at the time that gonorrhoea and syphilis were steps of the same disease, "the Venereal". Scanagati at this point ruled out the suggestion of syphilitic chancre because Malton's urine was fine and light with a pungent odour. Scanagati did ask if Malton had previously ever had a similar peculiarity of his urine. Malton replied that when he was very young and still inexperienced sexually, for some time following a fever he had had the same unusual urine, and indeed that on one occasion this symptom coincided with certain tumours on the testicles. It was only by chance that he had not had recourse to surgery, the reason being that he was also afflicted with a throat infection-to which he was prone-and therefore had his vein opened four times. Thereupon the inflammation subsided, and equally the tumours and sediment disappeared. <br><br> He told me that as a youth he had sometimes experienced some difficulty and a burning sensation when urinating, which subsided when his blood was let and with the application of poultices. I observed that from time to time his face and body were covered with purplish spots, which, having produced a little fluid, would disappearas indeed happened in the course of the cure, at the end of which his face was entirely <br><br> 33 WWM, M7-47.

From this observation, it seemed to me simple to deduce both the original cause and the more immediate cause of the said sediment: namely a natural complexion of humours which are exacerbated by muriatic [i.e., acidic] sourness, together with the marked inflammation of the blood and the motion of the contracted poison. <br><br> Scanagati then recommended the continuation of the electuary made of emollient, guaiacum resin, balsam, <span class="yellow">rhubarb</span>, and nitre. <br><br> What does all this add up to in terms of diagnosis? The early illness is a mystery. Did he have an inguinal hernia; or perhaps mumps or epididymitis? His was a childless marriage. He seems to have been too fit for the illness to have been rheumatic fever. Cystitis was not uncommon and this could certainly lead to "strangury". Perhaps Rockingham suffered from a congenital defect of his urinogenitary system which would result in recurrent attacks of cystitis and might cause long-term damage to the urinary tract and eventual destruction of the kidneys, precipitating sudden and unexpected death. <br><br> Another possibility might be diabetes. Rockingham had a urinary infection and certainly suffered from recurrent skin infections, although it appears from Scanagati's report that these cleared up when mercury was administered. <br><br> Certainly the marquis complained often about pains in his side and stomach and made no secret of his "old complaint". He was noticeably less physically active as he moved into his thirties and only occasionally exerted himself by riding any distance, even though he had enjoyed hunting when he was younger. He found the pains caused by his "old complaint" made him feel so ill that he was unable to concentrate on "any Manner of Business" and on occasion it seemed likely to prevent him from attending Parliament.38 He may well have suffered from a problem with gallstones from an early age.39 He appears to have suffered from a nervous disorder which manifested itself in severe palpitations, trembling, and other types of physical discomforts such as boils and headaches with which he was frequently afflicted.40 He probably had constipation too, since he was always dosing himself with purgatives. In fact in April 1772 the Duke of Richmond decided that Rockingham's real problem was a "surfeit of physick"41 although Edmund Burke noted in June 1772 that the marquis had had a long and severe illness.42 Whatever his many and varied ailments, Rockingham survived until he was 52 in spite of the attentions of both doctors and quacks and that, for the mid-eighteenth century, was a good age. The mystery still remains, however. Contemporary opinion had it that he died of pneumonia but it must have struck <br><br> 38 WWM, R153-1. Rockingham to Burke, 31 October 1767; WWM, RI-1238.

Abstract
Background
Taiwan's primary community care network (PCCN) demonstration project, funded by the Bureau of National Health Insurance on March 2003, was established to discourage hospital shopping behavior of <span class="yellow">people</span> and drive the traditional fragmented health care providers into cooperate care models. Between 2003 and 2005, 268 PCCNs were established. This study profiled the individual members in the PCCNs to study the nature and extent to which their network infrastructures have been integrated among the members (clinics and hospitals) within individual PCCNs.<br><br>Methods
The thorough questionnaire items, covering the network working infrastructures – governance, clinical, marketing, financial, and information integration in PCCNs, were developed with validity and reliability confirmed. One thousand five hundred and fifty-seven clinics that had belonged to PCCNs for more than one year, based on the 2003–2005 Taiwan Primary Community Care Network List, were surveyed by mail. Nine hundred and twenty-eight clinic members responded to the surveys giving a 59.6 % response rate.<br><br>Results
Overall, the PCCNs' members had higher involvement in the governance infrastructure, which was usually viewed as the most important for establishment of core values in PCCNs' organization design and management at the early integration stage. In addition, it found that there existed a higher extent of integration of clinical, marketing, and information infrastructures among the hospital-clinic member relationship than those among clinic members within individual PCCNs. The financial infrastructure was shown the least integrated relative to other functional infrastructures at the early stage of PCCN formation.<br><br>Conclusion
There was still room for better integrated partnerships, as evidenced by the great variety of relationships and differences in extent of integration in this study. In addition to provide how the network members have done for their initial work at the early stage of network forming in this study, the detailed surveyed items, the concepts proposed by the managerial and theoretical professionals, could be a guide for those health care providers who have willingness to turn their business into multi-organizations.<br><br><br><br>Background
Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) under the control of the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI), was launched in March 1995 to replace its social insurance system that was covering 59% of its population: government employees, labourers, farmers and servicemen [1]. By June 2003 the number of <span class="yellow">people</span> insured had reached 21,956,729 (99%). There were 17,259 medical providers (92%), including 575 hospitals and 16,684 clinics contracted with the BNHI for serving the enrolled population. The unique phenomenon characterized in Taiwan health care industry different from those in the western countries is the freedom of <span class="yellow">patients</span> to choose the health care providers they want, no matter what their disease severity is. Furthermore, Taiwan <span class="yellow">people</span> favor the larger scales of facilities and this fallacy leads to the phenomenon of big-hospital shopping. For example, <span class="yellow">people</span> choose the medical centers which are accredited as the highest level of medical science in Taiwan when they only suffer from a common cold.
In the spring of 2003, the SARS epidemic viciously attacked the health of Taiwan's <span class="yellow">people</span>. The <span class="yellow">people</span>'s freedom to choose medical providers caused the national health authority to barely control and traced the flow of epidemic. This event made Taiwan national health authorities rethink what happened and how it damaged under the traditional fragmented health care providers in Taiwan. One health reform launched was named the "Primary Community Care Network (PCCN) demonstration project", a nationwide health care financing program funded by the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) in March 2003 and it was a new model for the Taiwan government to redefine the role of family physicians in the health care delivery system. A PCCN in Taiwan consists of a group of clinic physicians whose medical jobs are viewed as family care and at least one hospital for secondary or tertiary care. The idea of member component design in PCCNs was aimed to lead the Taiwan citizens to choose one clinic physician as their personal family physician for health maintenance and this family physician also would have the responsibility of referring the <span class="yellow">patients</span> to specialty care if necessary. From a national health authority perspective, they expected the Taiwan <span class="yellow">people</span> to put an end to their fallacy that "bigger is better" for health care organizations and establish the idea of "<span class="yellow">human</span> health", starting with prevention and primary care, followed by secondary or tertiary care, emphasizing health promotion and maintenance instead of disease curing. Furthermore, it could decrease the inappropriateness of medical usage, i.e., over-uses of secondary and tertiary medical services in the high-tech hospitals. In addition, the national health authority was expected to drive the traditional fragmented heath care providers into coordinated medical multidisciplinary teams and share the limited medical resources through the PCCN demonstration project. In summary, the PCCN demonstration project was aimed to: 1) change the traditional <span class="yellow">patients</span>' customs of freely choosing health care organizations and establish referral channels along the continuum of care, and 2) establish partnerships among the primary care clinics and hospitals to provide a continuum of health care services. It was also expected to establish the primary care system of family physicians to provide whole-<span class="yellow">people</span> health care and improve care quality [1].
Partnership structures in the PCCNs represent the virtual vertical (i.e., between the member clinics and hospitals) and virtual horizontal (i.e., among the member clinics) aspects of organizing, which designate the formal relationships between individuals and the total network and include organizational design to ensure effective communication, coordination, and integration across the total network. Each PCCN consists of five to ten clinics: half of them should offer the services of general medicine, internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatric, or family medicine. And each PCCN has a central headquarters, usually in one of the clinic facilities, to coordinate and integrate the network. All the clinic physicians in a PCCN are assigned the roles of "family physicians" or "gatekeepers" who recruit <span class="yellow">people</span> from the local community, keep background and medical files on them, certify family physician education training programs, and hold office hours in the member hospital, where they serve as joint faculty members for further medical consultations or medical utilizations of labs and tests, if necessary. In addition, the hospital member is asked to help clinic physicians in their network to set up a medical information system, share hospital resources (medical equipment and library literature) with the clinic physicians in their network and establish referral channels among the network members. Furthermore, this new demonstration model tries to minimize the barriers to <span class="yellow">patient</span> access by setting up 24-hour a day, 7-day a week medical consultation telephone lines for providing urgent services onsite and for taking care of the <span class="yellow">patients</span> whose family physicians' practices are closed to assure seamless care channels. The BNHI funded these extra demonstration actions, at around one hundred thousand US dollars (i.e., NT$3,500,000) for each PCCN under the current fee-for-service payment system [1].
Figure 1 describes the organizational structure of individual PCCNs introduced in the demonstration project in Taiwan.
To date, the PCCN demonstration project has been in operation for more than three years. There have been 268 PCCNs formed in the period of 2003 to 2005 around Taiwan. The geographical distributions of PCCNs and their members were described in Table 1. Analyzing all 1,557 participating clinic members in the demonstration project in terms of medical specialties, they cover general medicine, internal medicine, surgeries, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, family medicines, otolaryngology, ophthalmology, rehabilitation medicine, dermatology, and psychiatry, with 237 clinics providing more than two specialties. On the other hand, each PCCN recruits at least one district or regional accredited hospital for acute care demands (required for network members) and a medical center for tertiary care support (not required for network members). There are 6 medical centers, 52 regional hospitals, and 71 district hospitals joining in the demonstration project. See Table 1 for more detailed information about the PCCN members.
To date, there have been few empirical studies of the working relationships that have developed between members of the PCCN program. Partnership needs a method to determine at an early stage, to make sure whether they are making the most of collaboration [2] and the acceptance of the contracting networks in Taiwan as an organizational innovation worthy of greater diffusion deserves to be explored. Therefore, this study used a structured questionnaire to characterize the relationship among the members in the individual PCCNs, with regard to governance, clinical, marketing, financing, as well as information integration infrastructures. The results of this study provide descriptive analyses in detail to map the partnership developments, to enrich the body of knowledge of the partner relationships and to help policy makers understand the coordinated efforts of these health care providers which have developed under this system. It also provides the recommendations for heath policy decision-making and management of networks of health care providers for the future involvement.<br><br>Methods
This study was aimed at providing descriptive analyses to map the partnership development. To understand the actual integration actions done by network members, the theoretical concept employed by network partnerships were described and then the derived survey instrument was developed.
Theoretical framework for organization design of network integration
The rapid organizational changes in the health care industry have driven theorists from every discipline and across the world to seek an approach that allows organizations to flourish. Organization theory allows investigators to profile an organization from the aspect of patterns and regularities in organizational design and behavior. In the early 20th century, classical management theorists claimed that an organization has "a best way" to be organized and managed [3]. That implied that all organizations would own the "same" organizational styles or structures. In the 1960s, several theorists [4-8] challenged this assumption by applying a "contingency approach" to propose that there is no best way to organize an organization, and that the effectiveness of an organizational structure varies with the situation of an organization. Furthermore, it is proposed that the best way to organize an organization depends on the nature of the environment to which the organization relates.
Contingency theory delineates the concepts "organization's internal features," "the demands of organizational environments," "best adaptation," and, the most important and difficult of all, "best match" [9]. Lawrence & Lorsch [7] argued that environments characterized by uncertainty and rapid rates of change in market conditions or technology impose different demands, including constraints and opportunities, on organizations than do placid and stable environments. Similarly to Lawrence and Lorsch's views mentioned above, Galbraith [10,11] stressed the contingency perspective on information processing. The information-processing approach emphasizes that environment, size, and technology impose different information-processing requirements on organizations, and thus an organization must be designed to encourage information flow in both vertical and horizontal directions to achieve the overall tasks of the organization and, finally, organizational effectiveness [11-14].
Some theorists have criticized conventional contingency theorists who presume that organizational structure is driven by the environment. <span class="red">Child</span> [15], Miller [16], Van de Ven and Drazin [17], and Tushman and Romanelli [18] raised such criticisms; they argued that organizations become what they are not only because of the environment, but also because of choices made by members, especially choices about strategy and organizational design. As Thompson's words in the book Organizations in Action [8] put it, "organizations are not determined simply by their environments (p.27)." He also pointed out that "administration may innovate on any or all of the necessary dimensions, but only to the extent that innovations are acceptable to those on whom the organization can and must depend." Instead of assuming that administrators are highly constrained in their decisions, strategic contingency theorists emphasized "the importance of choice," that is, "the freedom of agency" [15]. Furthermore, Pfeffer [19] explicitly pointed out that "organizational structures are the outcomes of political contests within organizations (p.38)."
Daft [14] proposed a top management model to delineate how "a strategy is a plan for interacting with the competitive environment to achieve organizational goals." He stated that the major responsibility of top management is to determine the goals, strategy, and design of an organization to adapt to a changing environment. To assess the external and internal environments of an organization seems to be the first task for top managers in defining an organization's goals and missions. Then, guided by the goals and missions of the organization, top managers shape the design of the organization, including structural forms, information system, technology, <span class="yellow">human</span> resources, organizational culture, and inter-organizational linkages, to achieve the final organizational performance.
Integration refers to the mechanisms of coordination, the ways guided to partnership goals to fit internal and external conditions [7,20,21]. In the early 1990s, proposals for US national health care reform recognized the need for integrating mechanisms to achieve both financial success and quality of care of a well-organized system of care [22,23]. Several researchers also viewed inter-organizational cooperation as resource exchanges, including client referrals, money, and staff [24-27]. From practical ways of viewing integration, the success of integration lies in the coordinative mechanisms and partnership working that support it [28], including an administrative organization that coordinates the operations of various health care services; a management information system that integrates clinical, utilization, and financial data and follows clients across different settings; a care coordination program such as case management or disease management that works with clients to arrange health care services; and a financial mechanism that enables pooling of funds across services [29-35]. Fox [36] suggested the success of integrated health networks should ensure that the new business link such aspects as technology, functional skills, customer access, management, or products that can be shared across both the core and the new business; to conduct market financial evaluation; to share the risk of vertical integration with outside entities, to develop the management structure that can reflect the degree of coordination necessary to support the core business activities; to ensure that the integration strategy meets the needs of customers, including medical treatment, the use of medical technology, and the preferred methods of purchase; and to measure the new business by its value to the enterprise as a whole, rather than by its profitability as a stand-alone entity.
In summary, the effects that integration in inter-organizational designs has on network management were substantial from a managerial perspective. Borrowing the ideas of strategic contingency perspective [8,15,19] and top management model [14], it could be imply that success (organization performance) in reengineering a network lies in the integration of process and services (see Figure 1), including leadership/governing structure, teamwork between disciplines and <span class="yellow">patient</span> care, financial planning, and information systems, characterized as the constructs of governance, clinical, financial, and information infrastructures, respectively, in this study. In addition, another construct, marketing infrastructure, was especially important and designed to explore for PCCNs in this study because of <span class="yellow">patients</span>' freedom of making healthcare choice and the traditional fragmented health care systems by individual health care organizations in Taiwan. One major reason for Taiwan <span class="yellow">people</span>'s hospital shopping preferences was that Taiwan <span class="yellow">people</span> usually believe the bigger the facility, the better capacities a facility has no matter on any aspect from medical professionals to tangible medical equipment and plants. And this fallacy made the public want to overuse the facility with high-tech medical services no matter if it fits their needs. From the health policy and management perspectives, therefore, the health care providers were encouraged to market their services as a new corporate identity and brand strategy [37], including offering tangible resources such as books, libraries, medical equipment, and intangible resources such as knowledge and information exchanges (education) and reputation sharing one another among PCCN members. Furthermore, through the process of marketing resource exchanges, therefore, each PCCN could establish the images of "one system, one brand and quality" for the public and for the health care providers. It also makes it be more visible to the public.
The five integration infrastructures of network management were constructed as a conceptual framework in this study to help to portray how the PCCN members have done. The survey instrument development was described in the following.<br><br>Survey instrument development: integration infrastructures and measurements of partnerships
Based on the five integration infrastructures of network management, the structured questionnaire were derived from extensive literature reviews.
Governance infrastructure
Governance assumes the broad responsibility for organizational goals and survival and involves the series process of setting and monitoring organizational goals and strategy development through a board of representatives [38]. Governance or administrative integration infrastructure in establishing network partnerships refers to administrative structures (or responsibilities) created to facilitate communication, clear lines of authority, accountability, and responsibility for <span class="yellow">patient</span> care services; to negotiate budgets and financial trade-offs; and to present a cohesive, consistent message in interactions with external agencies and the community [29,39-41] and most important for members in contract agreements, to manage participation [33]. From a multidisciplinary perspective, Mitchell and Shortell [42] applied the concepts of governance and management characteristics in effective community health partnerships. The construct of governance involved several tasks, including setting priorities for strategic goals, choosing the membership composition, obtaining the necessary financial resources, and setting up the accountability systems, and so on. The construct of the management refers to the tasks of engaging and maintaining organizational members' interest in a shared vision and mission, providing appropriate structures and coordination mechanisms for the specified strategies, promoting constructive conflicts and managing destructive conflicts, implementing information systems to monitor the dynamics, adjusting the leadership in the overall membership, and so on. The issues of governance and administrative integration in the PCCNs could include [2,38,40,41,43-47]:
• planning the shared visions and missions
• determining the shared service strategies, cooperation priorities, policies and principles
• identifying the information needed and how to get it
• organizing the network dynamics and member roles
• leading and managing the conflicts and communication
• designing and controlling the shared network performance systems, including indicator settings, feedbacks, and accountability.<br><br>Clinical infrastructure
The idea of care integration begins through such public programs that include social workers in public welfare departments, caseworkers in mental health, or nurses in public health departments. In the late 1980s, care integration was deemed necessary for the streamlining of care and negotiating the maze of long-term care services. At that time, it was referred to as service coordination or case management, or in other related terms [29]. The purpose of care integration is to work directly with <span class="yellow">patients</span> and their families over time to help them arrange and manage the complex resources that <span class="yellow">patients</span> may need to maintain health and independent functioning. At the same time, care integration is used to achieve the most cost-effective use possible of scarce resources, by steering <span class="yellow">patients</span> to the health, social, and support services most appropriate for them at a given time [29]. Conrad and Dowling [33] pointed out that to coordinate and integrate <span class="yellow">patient</span> care relies on connecting <span class="yellow">patient</span> services at the different stages of the <span class="yellow">patient</span> care processes. Care coordination in integrated networks can be achieved through integration of training programs and some clinical services, provision of complementary clinical capabilities, clinical geographic proximity design, clear role definition of each institution, commitment and flexibility of leaderships and medical staffs, and the support of a large referring physician groups embracing the affiliation concepts [48]. The issues of clinical integration in the PCCNs could include [48-50]:
• planning and differentiating target markets based on the clinical services of the network members
• uniting individual clinical professionals for clinical project planning
• designing <span class="yellow">patient</span>-centered care or case management teams
• establishing committees responsible for <span class="yellow">patient</span>-centered case report meetings, case referral, transfer, and tracing, file management (record and information exchanges), clinical quality management (quality assurance, improvement, risk and malpractice management, and utilization review), and medical continuing education and on-job education.<br><br>Marketing infrastructure
Marketing integration refers to how to work together as a whole both from the provider and <span class="yellow">patient</span> perspectives. One of the case reports interviewing developing integrated delivery system or networks realized that the most important thing is how an integrated system or network is promoted and what is promoted for the consumers [51], including focusing on product development, making sure the branding holds together, marketing directly to consumers, demonstrating values to consumers, and even conducting marketing research to make efforts for the long term. In a health care network with several organizational members and target <span class="yellow">patients</span>, the marketing infrastructure in PCCNs here refers to provider members' marketing, meaning the resource sharing and market development in a PCCN as a whole. The issues of the marketing integration in the PCCNs could include [37,52-54]:
• sharing the literature and facility publications among the network members
•uniting public promotions such as united activities, electronic and paper media for enhancing the network reputation as "one system, one brand and quality"
• differentiating target markets of the network for competing in the medical industry.<br><br>Financial infrastructure
Comprehensive, flexible, and adequate financing is a goal of the ideal continuum of care. That component is the most critical and challenging to manage under the changes in the health care delivery environment. Gillies et al. [30] suggested that integrating financial management across operating units adds the greatest value to systems or organizations. In one case study, Bramson et al. [55] also showed that reducing costs through joint purchasing by the radiology departments of a vertically integrated health system could yield substantial savings. The issues of the financial integration in the PCCNs could include:
• budgeting
• uniting equipment, medical materials, and drug purchasing and routine administrative stuff management
• pooling recruitment funds
• designing a financial risk and sharing mechanism.<br><br>Information infrastructure
Information is an essential component of an organization. A complete information system can help an organization to integrate its individual units and efficiently manage the continuum. The ideal information system for a continuum of care was conceived of and formed in the mid-1980s [56]. During the late 1980s, computer technology began to make an information system feasible and affordable through new computer chips with expanded capability and networking technology. In the 1990s, the individual services of the continuum upgraded their information systems to combine clinical, financial, and utilization data [29]. Some studies have argued that the quality of information systems can drive costs down, because a good information system can give physicians easy electronic access to complete the documentation of the <span class="yellow">patients</span>' clinical records, better inform them about reimbursement and capitation issues, help them easily associate and manage cases together, and achieve a higher level of professional satisfaction [57,58]. Using Inova Health System, an integrated delivery system in northern Virginia, as an example, Wager, Heda, and Austin [59] showed that by developing a health information network within an integrated delivery system, Inova can have a clinical transaction system for hospitals and other entities, a data repository for decision support and outcome management, a managed care information system to support managed care and capitation contracts, and greater capability to acquire physicians. The issues of information coordination include [60-68]:
• establishing an electronic medical record system, regional information network for <span class="yellow">patient</span> clinical and administrative data, clinical service arrangements and administrative work
• uniting the system information management and web pages.
The structured questionnaire was developed with the wording of practical managerial actions based on the five concepts just mentioned. There were 19 survey items on governance infrastructure, 25 on clinical infrastructure, 13 on marketing infrastructure, 20 on financial infrastructure, and 7 on information infrastructure. All 84 items were, simultaneously, applied to examine the relationships of the clinic's peer members and the relationship of clinic and hospital members in a PCCN, and it resulted in a total of 168 survey questions. The detailed information of the item questions was listed in Table 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The structured questionnaires were drafted from previous literatures and then examined by two academic professors for theoretical accuracy. Then one pilot study was pre-tested for the PCCN pioneers (i.e., 92 network clinic members) and 116 hospital providers which have partner relationships with other health care organizations (i.e., hospitals, clinics, long-term care facilities). The wordings and meanings of each question item were revised to assure content validity. The Cronbach α values for the five integration constructs – governance, clinical, marketing, finance, and information infrastructure were 0.946, 0.958, 0.932, 0.944, and 0.898 for the measures of clinic-clinic member relationships; and 0.945, 0.949, 0.916, 0.948, and 0.896 for the measures of clinic-hospital member relationships.<br><br>
Study subjects
To find the member partnership, we sent questionnaires to 1,557 individual clinics which had belonged to PCCNs for at least one year, based on information contained in the Taiwan Primary Community Care Network List (Bureau of National Health Insurance 2003, 2004 and 2005).
We let clinic members in all PCCNs point out how they coordinate with their peer clinic members and hospital members within a PCCN because individual clinic members could be better informants than hospital members, which need to deal with multiple clinic relationships and therefore might find it hard to describe the coordination involvement one by one with clinic members. Moreover, networks form for various reasons and it might lead to the various involvements by individual network members (i.e., hospital and clinic members). Therefore, using the participating clinics as individual survey units, the results could portray the overall dynamics and processes more authentically and detailed throughout all PCCNs in the demonstration project.
Nine hundred and twenty-eight clinics responded (59.6 %), with 239 clinics in the Taipei region, 165 in the northern region, 241 in the central region, 108 in the southern region, 150 in the Kao-Ping region, and 15 in the eastern region of Taiwan. Ten clinics had not mentioned their practicing locations. There is no statistically significant difference in geographical distribution between the respondents and the study population (χ2 = 4.208, p > 0.05).<br><br>Analytical techniques
The data was first analyzed descriptively with frequency counts (percentage) for each survey item, instead of using mean as a statistical method, because the variation among the respondents may not represent the normal distribution and it might ignore the extreme values for the respondents' answers. To compare how the respondents perceived the strength of integration existing in clinic-clinic and clinic-hospital relationships, paired t-tests were performed for individual survey items, using the original numerical scores.<br><br>
Results
Profiling the partnerships in Taiwan PCCNs: governance infrastructure
With regard to the governance infrastructures, the frequency was counted for each survey item with recalculated scales: disagree (Likert scale 1 and 2), fair (Likert scale 3), and agree (Likert scale 4 and 5) with individual items. In clinic-clinic relationship (Table 2), the majority of clinic members agree that the determined deals were obeyed (Table 2, item 1: 88.69%), the goals and strategies of members were well-understood (Table 2, item 16: 79.74%), and the united principals for individual members were developed (Table 2, item 15: 79.42%). The higher percentages were also found in clinic-hospital relationship in the same items (Table 2). On the other hand, establishing fair coordination mechanism (Table 2, item 11: 27.91%), designing and employing the network performance indicators (Table 2, item 3: 21.23%), and establishing communication models and channels (Table 2, item 12: 19.94%) still occupied higher percentages not developed and deserved to been made the focus of more efforts in the future. Paired t-test analyses for all individual survey items of governance infrastructure showed that the deals obeyed (Table 2, item1) and plans and goals controlled (Table 2, item 2) were achieved more in clinic-clinic relationships than those in clinic-hospital relationships; however, the design of network performance indicators (Table 2, item 3), development of disintegration policy and principals (Table 2, item 8), and the establishment of fair coordination mechanism (Table 2, item 11) were reached more in clinic-hospital relationships than those in clinic-clinic relationships.<br><br>Profiling the partnerships in Taiwan PCCNs: clinical infrastructure
Examining the extent of clinical infrastructure for network members, establishing two-directed <span class="yellow">patient</span> referral systems and <span class="yellow">patient</span> referral information files (Table 3, items 35 & 37) and uniting medical continuing education and on-job education (Table 3, item 34) were shown at a highly implemented rate in clinic-clinic (more than 70%) and clinic-hospital (more than 80%) relationships. On the other hand, network members had higher percentages (more than 40%) not to think about the possible integration mechanisms including establishing committees to deal with medical malpractice (Table 3, item 44), planning and differentiating clinical market areas (Table 3, item 20), and designing <span class="yellow">patient</span>-centered case management teams (Table 3, item 22). Overall, there was better clinical integration involvement for all the described items in clinic-hospital relationships than those in clinic-clinic relationships within a network in this study (see Table 3, paired t-tests, p < 0.05).<br><br>Profiling the partnerships in Taiwan PCCNs: marketing infrastructure
For marketing planning, the clinics had better integrated marketing activities with their respective hospitals than with peer clinic members within PCCNs for all studied items (Table 4, paired t-test, p < 0.05). Examining the clinic-clinic relationships, uniting social activities (Table 4, item 53), sharing the individual facility reports for updated services (Table 4, item 46), public promotion (Table 4, item 54), and uniting and joining the facility activities (Table 4, item 51) were the top four marketing works done among clinic members (more than 60% implemented rate); and those items also showed a higher implemented rate (more than 70%) between clinic and hospital members.
On the other hand, facility assets such as reports (Table 4, item 49), and professional literatures and books (Table 4, item 45) were not well-shared among clinic members ("never-thinking" rate: 42.13%). In addition, uniting the network publication could make more efforts in the future ("never-thinking" rate in item 50: 39.98%). The room for clinic-hospital partnership to think about acting was kind of different from those in the clinic-clinic relationship. In addition to the uniting publication that can be encouraged to improve the clinic-hospital relationship (Table 4, item 50: 27.48%), cooperating in research projects (Table 4, item 52: 25.00%) and identifying and differentiating target markets (Table 4, item 57: 24.57%) had still more opportunities to be focused on in the future.<br><br>Profiling the partnerships in Taiwan PCCNs: financial infrastructure
The PCCN members were found to have a lower extent of financial integration as evidenced by higher percentage of ''never thinking'' scale about the survey items on almost all items (see Table 5). Slightly more integration (that is, ''acting'' rate) was found in only four items both in clinic-clinic relationships and in clinic-hospital relationships, including uniting budget planning (Table 5: item 58), sharing places, materials, and equipment (Table 5: item 68), uniting budgeting for certain services (Table 5: items 72), and designing the resource distribution principals based on the whole network goals (Table 5: item 77).
Further examining the financial infrastructure in clinic-clinic relationship and clinic-hospital relationship, paired-t tests revealed that clinic-hospital partnerships were involved more in places, materials, and equipment sharing and maintenance (Table 5, items 62 and 68) (p < 0.05) and higher financial infrastructure coordination exists in clinic-clinic relationships (Table 5, items 58, 59, 63–65, 72, 74, 75, and 77) (p < 0.05).<br><br>Profiling the partnerships in Taiwan PCCNs: information infrastructure
There was significantly greater integration of information in clinic-hospital than clinic-clinic relationships in all items in this category (Table 6, paired t-tests, p < 0.001). The greatest integration was found in electronic <span class="yellow">patient</span> records (Table 6: item 78), followed by information integration for <span class="yellow">patient</span> data (Table 6: item 79) and clinical service arrangements (Table 6: item 81). The lowest level of integration in information infrastructure was found in administrative works such as registration, billing and so on (Table 6: item 82, ''never-thinking'' rate more than 50%) within network members.<br><br>
Discussion
In this study, we surveyed 943 clinics that had belonged to Taiwan PCCNs for more than a year to understand the nature and extent of integration to which they and their associated PCCN members (clinics and hospitals) had in governance, clinical, marketing, financial, and information infrastructures. It was found a wide variance in the kind and degree of integration among them and a lot of room for better integration (Table 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
From the governance perspective, we found lower integration was found in the establishment of fair coordination mechanism (Table 2: item 11) among member clinics and member hospitals. Coordination could be viewed from different perspectives, including the use of standardized languages and forms, organizational rules and procedures, the establishment of common rules, policies, and procedures, and the monitoring through memos, reports, and a computerized information system [69,70]. Facing the cumbersome integration processes, it suggests that each PCCN's headquarters should become actively involved and clarify the authority, responsibility and accountability of individual members, identify the potential conflict sources, and publicize the rules and regulation of network integration dynamics covering decision making processes, market planning, clinical teamwork designs, and financial reports of individual network members. These actions could enhance the trust and respect of network members one another and could improve the small extent of integration found in this study about the mechanisms for communication models and channels in the PCCNs (Table 2: item 12). From the network management perspective, communication could occur between the various entities such as between hospital and clinics, primary care physicians and specialists, managers and clinical professionals, and even among the clinical professionals in the network. To develop effective and timely communication channels was the key for the management of integrated organizations [30-32] and could alleviate the tensions that sometimes occur in the dynamics of the multi-organizations. In this study, it was found a low level of involvement of medical teams in medical projects, <span class="yellow">patient</span>-centered case management, and case report meetings among the network members (Table 3: item 21, 22, and 23) from a clinical integration perspective. Several researchers have addressed that clinical integration providing a process of medical management, care management, case management, and <span class="yellow">patient</span> management designed to transform the traditionally fragmented delivery system into a more cohesive system [71], and lead to higher service quality and assure financial objectives [72,73]. More attention could be paid to these activities in the future. In addition, it was also found less integration in planning and differentiating clinical market areas (Table 3, item 20) among the network members in the category of clinical infrastructure. This may result from the existing specialty diversities in individual PCCNs, which might not need to involve planning and differentiating market area based on the members' clinical services at the early stage of network development.
There was more involvement in marketing efforts in clinic-hospital relationships than in clinic-clinic relationships. Generally speaking, hospitals have more resources (i.e., money, <span class="yellow">human</span> resources, materials, and physical assets) than clinics, which might explain the stronger marketing involvements between the clinic and hospital members, including the library sharing (books and literatures), facility brochure dissemination, public promoting, and medical research cooperation. These integration efforts also meet the expectation of the national health authority for resource sharing and medical quality image enhancement among the health care providers.
Financial infrastructure was found to be the least integrated, with most items never considered. Perhaps the only reason for the higher score of budget planning activities (Table 5: items 58 and 77) was that BHNI required each PCCN to design and determine its budgeting arrangement in advance before joining the demonstration project. While slightly more financial involvement was made among network members (Table 5: items 68, 72 & 73), possibly due to similar needs, there remains a lot of room for financial integration in the future.
There was a need for networks to develop electronic information systems, though creating and managing an integrated information system involves very detailed work. Most of the clinics surveyed have focused more on the individual public members' administrative works such as filing <span class="yellow">patient</span> medical records, collecting and managing network <span class="yellow">patient</span> clinical data, and scheduling clinical services, which were required by the BNHI. The factors for the health care managers to adopt the integrated clinical information systems include the decision of make or buy, adoption leadership, adoption objectives, implementation leadership, phased versus simultaneous implementation, parallel systems, information technology implementation policies and practices, use levels and resistance, and realized benefits and return on investment calculation [66], which might be very cumbersome and time-consuming. It suggests that the network partners might be engaged, firstly, more in simpler network cooperation such as the administrative systems for <span class="yellow">patient</span> admission to the network members and establishing united web pages for <span class="yellow">patients</span> to access their family physicians and network members for medical and public promotion purposes. And for further integrated information investments, efforts must be redirected for network members to work together to define the approach to specific classes of integration for the long term [74].<br><br>Conclusion
This study tried to portray and trace how the facility <span class="yellow">participants</span> were involved in the Taiwan PCCNs. It was found that Taiwan PCCNs' members had higher involvement in the governance infrastructure, which was usually viewed as the most important for establishment of core values in PCCNs' organization design and management. There existed a higher extent of integration of clinical, marketing, and information infrastructures among the hospital-clinic member relationship than those among clinic members within individual PCCNs. The financial infrastructure was shown the least integrated relative to other functional infrastructures at the early stage of PCCN formation. Page [43] argued that networks form and grow for various reasons, however, only some of them could be compatible with the iterative processes of collaboration. Some <span class="yellow">participants</span> in the PCCNs may simply seek short-term economic gains and have little interest in joint learning and continuous improvement. From an organizational design perspective, the old phrase proposed by the wisdom of the saying about developing the integrated organizations (networks) should be – "coming together is the beginning, and working together is the success." Page [43] examined the virtual provider organizations such as physician-hospital organizations and pointed out the issue of the provider attitudes and behaviors as the critically successful continuous improvements in the health care environments. A wide variance of degree of network integration in Taiwan PCCNs still leaves room to improve.
In this study, the thoroughly surveyed items, that is, the potential network design content, were employed. In addition to provide how the network members have done their initial work at the early stage of network forming in this study, the detailed surveyed items, the concepts proposed by the managerial and theoretical professionals, could be also a guide for those health care providers who have a willingness to join multi-organizations. It suggests that health care providers could take more detailed looks about those surveyed items and give some possible opportunities to create the potential actions. Further research could be empirically done to explore the relative influence of these integration mechanisms on the effectiveness of organizational partnerships.
The partnerships within each PCCN represent various relationships that depend on how much the members are engaged in the projects. In addition to the macro concepts including governance, clinical, marketing, financial, and information infrastructures explored in this study, other managerial issues for integrated organizations were also suggested such as formation of an integrated cultural atmosphere, <span class="yellow">human</span> resources management, physician involvement, mission and commitment establishment, from micro organizational behavior perspective [30-32,34,36,75,76]. Micro managerial and longitudinal research designs could be employed to more precisely catch the never completing integration efforts in the future.<br><br>Abbreviations

Abstract
A recombinant phage, SpC3, containing a 17 kb genomic DNA insert representing approximately 60% of the 3' portion of the <span class="yellow">sheep</span> collagen alpha 2 gene, was evaluated by electron microscopic R loop analysis. A minimum of 17 intervening sequences (introns) and 18 alpha 2 coding sequences (exons) were mapped. With the exception of the 850 base pair exon located at the extreme 3' end of the insert, all exons contained 250 base pairs or less. The total length of all the exons in SpC3 was 3,014 base pairs. The length distribution of the 17 introns ranged from 300 to 1600 base pairs; together, all of the introns comprised 14,070 base pairs of SpC3 DNA.

It is a major extracellular constituent of tissues such as bone, tendon, skin and lung where, because of its great tensile strength, it plays an important <br><br> role in tissue structure and function. The polypeptides comprising type I <br><br> collagen are synthesized in long, precursor forms, referred to as pro al(I) and pro a2 chains,1 each containing approximately 1500 amino acid residues (1). <br><br> 1 The terminology for the primary translation products of the various <br><br> collagen messenger RNAs is still in a state of flux. It is known that al(I) and a2 chains are synthesized in precursor forms; these are currently termed pro al(I) and pro a2 chains (1). However, recent studies (43,44) have shown that the actual primary translation product of al(I) mRNA is somewhat larger <br><br> than the pro al(I) chain; this translation product has been termed a "pre-pro al(I) chain." Although the corresponding "pre-pro a2 chain" likely exists, it has not yet been characterized. For simplicity, therefore, until the <br><br> proper terminology for the primary translation product is clarified, we have <br><br> chosen to use the terms "al(I)" and "a2" to refer to the type I collagen mRNAs and collagen structural gene sequences. <br><br> ?) IRL Press Umited, 1 Falconberg Court, London W1V 5FG, U.K. <br><br> Volurne 8 Number 10 1980 <br><br> 2241 <br><br> Nucleic Acids Research <br><br> There is increasing evidence that the quantities of al(I) and a2 <br><br> chains produced by cells may be regulated, in part, at the genomic level <br><br> (1). However, to understand the processes which mediate their expression, <br><br> it is necessary to understand the structural organization of these collagen genes and the various enzymes that modify the collagen chains after its <br><br> synthesis (1). As an initial approach to this problem, we have recently <br><br> isolated a recombinant <span class="yellow">bacteriophage</span>, termed SpC3, containing approximately 60% of the a2 gene for type I collagen. Partial characterization of this <br><br> a2 gene demonstrated that, like most other structurally evaluated eukaryotic genes, the coding sequences are interspersed with intervening sequences (2). The present study further characterizes this portion of the a2 <br><br> gene by utilizing electron microscopic R loop analysis to map the coding regions (exons) and intervening sequences (introns) contained within the <span class="yellow">sheep</span> genomic insert of SpC3. The data suggests that the structural <br><br> organization of this portion of the a2 collagen gene represents 3 kb of coding information that is interspersed in a complex fashion with 17 introns over 17 kb of genome. <br><br> MATERIALS AND METHODS <br><br> Isolation and characterization of a2 collagen recombinant clone, SpC3. <br><br> The <span class="yellow">sheep</span> a2 collagen recombinant clone, SpC3, containing a portion of the <span class="yellow">sheep</span> a2 gene, was isolated as previously described (2). Briefly, <br><br> high molecular weight fetal <span class="yellow">sheep</span> liver DNA was extracted by the method of Blin and Stafford (3), and 15-20 kb DNA fragments, resulting from partial Eco RI digestion, were isolated and ligated to the left and right arms of Charon 4A. The recombinant DNA was then packaged in vitro and the <span class="yellow">sheep</span> <br><br> genomic library amplified (4-6). Screening of the <span class="yellow">sheep</span> genomic library was <br><br> conducted utilizing [32 P]-labeled fetal <span class="yellow">sheep</span> tendon type I collagen cDNA and <br><br> several positive recombinant phages were isolated. One recombinant, containing a 17 kb <span class="yellow">sheep</span> genomic insert, was demonstrated to have coding sequences corresponding to 60% of the 3' end of a2 mRNA. Prior studies showed that the insert in SpC3 was not due to ligation of noncontiguous restriction fragments and/or genetic rearrangement during the cloning process (2). Electron mi croscopy. <br><br> To visualize the recombinant <span class="yellow">bacteriophage</span> DNA structure complementary to a2 collagen mRNA, 1 iig of SpC3 DNA was lyophilized with 1 ig or 100 ng of mRNA <br><br> to give DNA:mRNA ratios of 1:1 and 10:1, respectively. These were then dissolved in 10 i1 of R loop buffer [70% (v/v) deionized formamide, 0.1 N-[tris (hydroxy<br><br> 2242 <br><br> Nucleic Acids Research <br><br> methyl)methyl] glycine (tricine)-NaOH, pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, and 0.01 M ethyl<br><br> enediaminetetraacetate (EDTA)], incubated in sealed capillary tubes at 520 for 14 hr (7), and then diluted 1:10 with R loop buffer. Two spreading methods were used to subsequently prepare the hybrids for visualization in the electron microscope. <br><br> 70% formamide method. Immediately before spreading onto a deionized <br><br> water hypophase, the nucleic acid mixtures were diluted an additional 10-fold in R loop buffer and cytochrome c, 100 vg/ml, was added. <br><br> Urea-formamide method.   The nucleic acid solutions were spread using a modification of the method of Westphal and Lai (8,9). The hyperphase contained 55% formamide, 2.6 M urea, 0.009 M EDTA, 0.09 M tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, and the nucleic acid mixture (approximately 0.1 to 1.0 ig/ml). <br><br> The mixture was heated at 40? for 30 sec, placed in ice water, and then allowed to reach room temperature. Cytochrome c, 100 pg/ml, was added immediately before spreading onto a deionized water hypophase. <br><br> The nucleic acid-protein films from both methods were absorbed onto <br><br> parlodion-coated grids, stained with uranyl acetate (10), dehydrated in 90% ethanol and rotary-shadowed with platinum-palladium (80:20) at an angle of 50. Micrographs were taken with a Siemens Elmiskop 101 electron microscope at an original magnification of 10,000 and an accelerating voltage of 60 kv. Nucleic acid lengths were measured at a final magnification of 43,000 with a <br><br> Hewlett-Packard 9810A calculator equipped with a 9864A digitizer using pBR322 and fX-174 double and single stranded DNA, respectively, as internal length standards. <br><br> Approximately 10,000 hybrid molecules were screened for these studies; approximately 200 represented molecules containing unambiguous regions <br><br> appropriate for quantitative analysis. The mean lengths of each intron and exon were determined for each method and the data expressed as mean ? <br><br> standard deviation. Nucleic acid lengths of < 50 base pairs could not be <br><br> accurately determined using the methods outlined above. Thus, in the cases <br><br> where introns or exons were of this length or less, accurate error estimates could not be made. <br><br> Bi ohazard precauti ons. <br><br> The construction and screening of the <span class="yellow">sheep</span> genomic library together with amplification of pCg45 and preparation of high titre lysates of chimaeric <br><br> Charon 4A were performed under the physical and biological containment levels specified by the NIH guidelines for recombinant DNA research (11). <br><br> 2243 <br><br> Nucleic Acids Research <br><br> RESULTS <br><br> Location and orientation of the intervening and a2 mRNA coding sequences in the SpC3 recombinant DNA. <br><br> Hybridization of fetal <span class="yellow">sheep</span> tendon type I collagen mRNA to SpC3 DNA <br><br> yielded a complex R loop pattern in the region where the <span class="yellow">sheep</span> genomic insert was expected to be ligated to the arms of the lambda vector, Charon 4A. To <br><br> confirm that these hybridization events were restricted to the inserted <span class="yellow">sheep</span> DNA fragment, duplex DNA strands on both sides of this hybridization area were measured. Using pBR322 as an internal length standard, the left arm of the phage was found to contain 21,780 ? 1500 bp, and the right arm, 11,950 ? <br><br> 1030 bp, corresponding to the report values for the left and right arms, respectively, of Charon 4A DNA (5,6). <br><br> The hybridization of SpC3 to a2 mRNA resulted in the destabilization of <br><br> the inserted helical duplex DNA fragment such that one DNA strand was displaced (Figure 1). Occasionally, the displaced DNA strand was mostly absent, probably due to fragmentation induced by accidental mechanical shearing. This event considerably enhanced the visualization and ordering of the introns. <br><br> As the a2 mRNA annealed to complementary DNA regions present in one <br><br> DNA strand, numerous single-stranded loops resulted. These loops, referred to as introns, represented DNA sequences not complementary to the mRNA. Although, by convention, introns are usually sequentially labeled 5' to 3', an opposite order had to be employed in this case as SpC3 does not contain the sequences coding for the 5' end of <span class="yellow">sheep</span> a2 mRNA. Infrequently, all introns <br><br> were clearly observed within the same hybrid molecule (Figure 1). The largest introns were towards the left arm of Charon 4A and were more clustered than the introns at the opposite end of the hybrid. Thus, much of the genetic <br><br> information coding for the a2 mRNA was contained in that half of the hybrid attached to the right arm. <br><br> A small non-hybridized tail was consistently found in the region where <br><br> the right arm of the phage was ligated to the <span class="yellow">sheep</span> genomic insert (Figure 1). This tail likely corresponded to the 3' poly A sequence of the a2 mRNA. At <br><br> the extreme 5' end of the insert, a variable length was often observed for the remaining unhybridized mRNA strand. This was most likely due to the size heterogeneity of the a2 mRNA used in these studies. <br><br> Size determination and comparative analysis of SpC3 introns. <br><br> Although localization of exon and intron sequences was possible with both the 70% formamide and urea-formamide spreading methods, the probability of <br><br> detecting unambiguous regions in a hybrid molecule was far greater with the <br><br> 2244 <br><br> Nucleic Acids Research <br><br> A                                B ',:  '14 .0. <br><br> 13 <br><br> 7 1 <br><br> -5 13 <br><br> .  .   . .   ,4                     x2%.

From these measurements we concluded that the length of the a2 collagen genetic regi?on in SpC3 was 17,084 bases long with only 3,014 bases actually coding for a2 mRNA. Therefore, only 18% of the mapped 17 kb <span class="yellow">sheep</span> genetic insert actually contained a2 structural information. <br><br> DISCUSSION <br><br> The organizational structure of the a2 collagen gene is complex. A minimum of 17 introns interrupt the 3 kb of ca2 genetic information interspersed as 18 exons over 17 kb of <span class="yellow">sheep</span> DNA. With the exception of exon "a" located at the extreme 3' end of the inserted a2 gene, all other mapped exons are rather small, exhibiting a size distribution range of 50 to 250 bp. In <br><br> contrast, the intron sizes range from 340 to 1540 bases occupying a total <br><br> of 14 kb. Thus, the DNA region containing the 3 kb of a2 collagen genetic information is 5.6 fold longer than the corresponding co2 mRNA sequences. <br><br> Although the total number of introns present within the 60% 3' portion <br><br> of the a2 <span class="yellow">sheep</span> gene was determined to be 17, variation in the precise number <br><br> TRANSRIPTlO <br><br> A                          5w                r <br><br> 1 "2a4  133  112s  11.17  0. 3O 2  715  6.2  313  04  4.2B  3.51  2.2  12 <br><br> EXON0            p  o    n         5  Ik         h     f     d 4  .  b   <br><br> WPM300       16   16  14   13  12  11  10  9   6  7  6  5  4  3   2   1 <br><br> B <br><br> 110   16     4.2  13111  112n  1113104  3.6    gm74  2 6.  4 4 2  3.2  22  in <br><br> 1  a1m03  133  1.2 11   10  01 341  6. 1   117  6.2 4  12  417  3I5'm 2  <br><br> DM00  1    q5    p  0    n   m  I  k.   j    i   h  g  f     d  c   b     a 147306   17   16   15  14  13  12  11  10  9   a  7  6  5  4  3   2   1 <br><br> 175 17.0 16.6& 16'5.5 15.0 14.5 14. 13.5 13.0 12.5 12.0 11.5 11 10.5M 10.0 9.5 9.0 8. 5.0 71 7.0 6.5 6. 5.5 50 4.5 4.0 3.5 3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 <br><br> KILOBASE <br><br> Fiue3      Organization of 60% of the 3' end of the <span class="yellow">sheep</span> a2 collagen gene.

Arrows represent the approximate location of intron-exon junctions. All values are presented as kilobase pairs. <br><br> 2249 <br><br> Nucleic Acids Research <br><br> of introns present in individual hybrid molecules was observed. The reason <br><br> for this may be due to size heterogeneity of the a2 mRNA used as a complementary probe. Although the a2 mRNA was extensively purified (2), some degradation was likely present. It is also possible that additional introns exist that are too small to be detected by electron microscopic R loop analysis. The most likely a2 genetic regions containing such introns are exons "g" and "m". Small <br><br> "protrusions" were sometimes observed within these exons that could represent small introns. Very small introns have been reported for tRNA genes (12,13), <br><br> and it will be necessary to sequence these regions of SpC3 to determine if such introns are present within the a2 <span class="yellow">sheep</span> genome. <br><br> The existence of mRNAs comprised of sequences complementary to noncontiguous regions in a DNA genome was first described for <span class="yellow">adenovirus</span> (14,15) and <br><br> simian virus (16,17) genes. Similar observations were soon reported for eukaryotic genes, including serum albumin (18), conalbumin (19), fibroin (20), s<br><br> globin (21,22), growth hormones (23,24), immunoglobulin (25), lysozyme (26), <br><br> ovalbumin (27-29), ovomucoid (30), rRNA (31-34), tRNA (12,13), and vitellogenin (35). The precise number or occurrence of introns within these genes does not seem to follow any clear pattern. However, the genes for albumin, conalbumin, <br><br> lysozyme, ovalbumin, and ovomucoid exhibit a structural organization comparable to the a2 collagen gene. All of these genes are composed of numerous small <br><br> exons, usually less than 250 base pairs, and introns which show a large size variation within an individual gene. Within all of these genomes, the DNA <br><br> regions required for coding structural formation are 4 to 7 times longer than the corresponding mRNA coding sequences. <br><br> As with the a2 collagen gene, a large unique exon at the extreme 3' end <br><br> is also present in the ovalbumin gene (36,37). In the a2 gene, this exon was 800 to 900 nucleotides in length, while in the ovalbumin gene the exon contained 1,030 base pairs. Interestingly, this ovalbumin exon contained 634-650 base pairs ot DNA sequence to the 3' side of the terminator <br><br> triplet, suggesting the ovalbumin mRNA has a large untranslated region at the 3' end. <br><br> The consistent appearance of a small non-hybridized tail, approximately 100 nucleotides in length, in the region where the right arm of the phage was ligated to the <span class="yellow">sheep</span> genomic insert of SpC3 very likely corresponded to the <br><br> 3' poly A sequence of the a2 mRNA. This would suggest that the a2 mRNA coding sequence terminates very near or at this point in the genome. Previously published biochemical evidence (2) obtained from restriction mapping and Southern blot analysis using [32P]-labeled <span class="yellow">chick</span> a2 cDNA probe supports <br><br> 2250 <br><br> Nucleic Acids Research <br><br> this observation. <br><br> It is unclear what role introns play in genetic expression. However, <br><br> it is known that these sequences are tranncribed as part of larger precursor mRNAs and the introns are then excised and the fragmented mRNA chains <br><br> covalently rejoined (38). Some evidence has recently accumulated demonstrating the existence of precursor a2 mRNAs (39,40). However, if the introns in the a2 gene are transcribed in their entirety, as has been <br><br> demonstrated for the introns in ovalbumin and globin (41,42), much larger precursor a2 mRNAs may exist than those reported to date. For if the re<br><br> mainder of the a2 collagen gene has a structural organization comparable to the 60% 3' portion that has been analyzed, it is probable that the a2 <br><br> collagen gene in its entirety is dispersed throughout a 30 kb DNA segment. <br><br> ACKNOWLEDGMENTS <br><br> We thank Dr. John Dahlberg and Frances Loebenstein, Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, for the generous use of a <br><br> Siemens Elmiskop 101 electron microscope; Dr. Ursula Heine and Benjamin Elliott, Laboratory of Viral Carcinogenesis, National Cancer Institute, for the use of a Hewlett-Packard calculator equipped with a digitizer and a Denton vacuum <br><br> evaporator, and Drs.
