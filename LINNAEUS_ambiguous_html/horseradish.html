Abstract
Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) was originally described as a non-histone chromosomal protein and is required for transcriptional gene silencing and the formation of heterochromatin. Although it is localized primarily at pericentric heterochromatin, a scattered distribution over a large number of euchromatic loci is also evident. Here, we provide evidence that <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> HP1 is essential for the maintenance of active transcription of euchromatic genes functionally involved in cell-cycle progression, including those required for DNA replication and mitosis. Depletion of HP1 in proliferating embryonic cells caused aberrant progression of the cell cycle at S phase and G2/M phase, linked to aberrant chromosome segregation, cytokinesis, and an increase in apoptosis. The chromosomal distribution of Aurora B, and the level of phosphorylation of histone H3 serine 10 were also altered in the absence of HP1. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we further demonstrate that the promoters of a number of cell-cycle regulator genes are bound to HP1, supporting a direct role for HP1 in their active transcription. Overall, our data suggest that HP1 is essential for the maintenance of cell-cycle progression and the transcription of cell-cycle regulatory genes. The results also support the view that HP1 is a positive regulator of transcription in euchromatin.<br><br>INTRODUCTION
Chromatin in higher eukaryotes is subdivided into different functional compartments termed heterochromatin and euchromatin (1). Heterochromatin differs from euchromatin in its DNA composition, replication timing, condensation throughout the cell cycle, and its ability to silence euchromatic genes placed adjacent to or within its territory, often described as position-effect-variegation (PEV) (2).
Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) was the first protein identified in <span class="yellow">Drosophila melanogaster</span> as a heterochromatin-associated protein (3); the corresponding gene has been cloned from a number of organisms and is highly conserved from <span class="yellow">yeast</span> to <span class="yellow">human</span> (4). Polytene chromosome staining showed that, in <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span>, HP1 is distributed mainly in pericentric heterochromatin, telomeric heterochromatin, the banded small fourth chromosome (5–8), as well as ∼200 individual loci scattered throughout the euchromatic chromosomal arms (5). The gene encoding HP1 in <span class="yellow">D.melanogaster</span>, Su(var)2-5, was isolated as a suppressor of PEV (9–11). The protein contains a highly conserved motif, the chromo (chromatin organization modifier) domain, similar to Polycomb (Pc), a repressor of homeotic genes (12). The association between HP1 and pericentric heterochromatin is believed to occur via the chromo domain of HP1 and the N-terminal tail of histone H3 methylated at lysine 9 (13,14), generated by histone methyltransferase-Su(var)3-9, a partner of HP1 in pericentric heterochromatin (15). The C-terminal chromo ‘shadow’ domain of HP1 interacts with other silencing complexes to suppress local transcriptional activity (15–18). However, studies of HP1 chromosomal distribution also showed that HP1 does not always co-localize with lysine 9 methylated histone H3 or Su(var)3-9, especially in euchromatic regions (19–21); in some cases, HP1 is found directly bound to DNA (22,23). All these features argue for distinct roles for HP1 in chromatin and in epigenetic gene regulation.
HP1 is believed to be an essential structural protein protecting the integrity of chromosomes during cell division (8,24). Swi6, the homolog of HP1 in <span class="yellow">fission yeast</span>, is dispensable for survival, but its deletion results in lagging chromosomes during anaphase, and a high rate of chromosome loss (25,26). Mutations of HP1 in <span class="yellow">D.melanogaster</span> result in late larval lethality, chromosome breakages/loss, telomere fusion and a high frequency of cells with abnormal anaphase (8,27). Null alleles of the HP1 functional partner in <span class="yellow">mice</span> (SUVAR39) also showed various chromosomal defects (28), supporting a conserved role for heterochromatin proteins in the regulation of chromosome dynamics during cell-cycle progression. However, the mechanism(s) involved remains to be understood.
In this study, we utilized <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> embryonic Kc cells and an RNA interference (RNAi)-based approach to demonstrate that HP1 plays an important role at S phase and G2/M phases during the cell cycle. We further show that nearly one-third of known/predicted cell-cycle regulators require HP1 to maintain their active transcription. These genes include MCMs, Orc4, CDC45L, INCENP, Aurora B, CAF1, Bub1, Bub3 and a few other cell-cycle regulators. ChIP analysis suggests that HP1 plays a direct role in their transcription. Therefore, the results of this study provide an alternative explanation for the specific role of HP1 in the regulation of chromatin dynamics and in cell-cycle progression.<br><br>MATERIALS AND METHODS
RNAi in Kc cells
<span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> Kc cells were routinely cultured at 25°C in Schneider <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal <span class="yellow">calf</span> serum, 160 μg/ml penicillin, 250 μg/ml streptomycin, and 4 mM l-glutamine. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of HP1 was generated by incubation of single-stranded RNA in annealing buffer (100 mM potassium acetate, 30 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mM magnesium acetate) for 3 min at 95°C and then placed in a beaker with water at 75°C and allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. The detailed procedure of RNAi was carried out according to the established protocols (). Briefly, Kc cells were seeded in a six-well dish using serum-free medium at 1 × 106 cells/ml. HP1 dsRNA (5 μg/ml) was added to the cultured Kc cells. After 60 min at room temperature, 2 ml of medium containing 10% serum was added to each well and the plates transferred to 25°C for up to 8 days. Western blotting and RT–PCR were carried out using the extract/total RNA isolated from control and dsRNA-treated cells on days 2, 6 and 8.<br><br>Cell-cycle and apoptosis analysis
The procedure for flow cytometric analysis of Kc cells followed that in the manual provided with the BrdU flow kit (BD PharMingen). The cells were fed with BrdU for 4 h, then scraped and collected. Fluorescence was measured using a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson). Data collection and analysis were performed using CellQuest software.<br><br>Electrophoresis and immunoblotting
Cell extracts (15 μg) were fractionated by 10% SDS–PAGE, then transferred to Hybond-P PVDF membranes (Amersham) and probed with primary antibodies (CIA9), and secondary antibodies (anti-<span class="yellow">rabbit</span> or anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> <span class="blue">horseradish</span> peroxidase-conjugated IgG), obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories. Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used for signal detection.
For the analysis of H3 ser10 phosphorylation, we used whole-cell extracts from 700 000 Kc cells (control and RNAi at day 8). Western blotting was performed using polyclonal antibodies against ser10-phosphorylated histone H3 at a dilution of 1:1000 (Upstate). Kc control cells arrested in mitosis by incubation in 25 µM colchicine (Sigma) for 24 h were also analyzed for comparison.<br><br>Immunofluorescence
Kc cells were seeded onto polylysine slides, fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. The incubation with primary antibodies was carried out in blocking solution for 1 h.
For staining of mitotic cells, the cells were permeabilized using PBST (PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100) and stained with polyclonal antibody against <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> Aurora B at 1:200 dilution and monoclonal <span class="yellow">mouse</span> at anti-β-tubulin 1:300 dilution (Chemicon International) as primary antibodies. Secondary antibodies were anti-<span class="yellow">rabbit</span> coupled with Alexa 488 (1:500) and anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> coupled to Alexa 546 (1:500) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon). Images were acquired using a confocal LSM510 META microscope (Zeiss). Stacks of images were analyzed using the IMARIS 4.0 program (Media cybernetics, Carlsbad, CA).<br><br>Antibodies
Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies of HP1 (<span class="yellow">rabbit</span> #192 and #187, 5 μg) and 5 μg of polyclonal anti-HA antibodies (Sigma) were used in each ChIP reaction. The specificity of the HP1 polyclonal antibodies was determined using various approaches, including western blotting assay, immunofluorescence staining and immunoprecipitation to pull down HP1 (data not shown). The monoclonal antibody HP1–CIA9 (5) was used at a dilution of 1:20 in immunoblotting assays.<br><br>Microarray analysis and RT–PCR
Total RNA was isolated from control and HP1-depleted Kc cells at day 8 using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA labeling and microarray data analysis followed the standard protocol from Affymetrix. We used ANOVA (P < 0.001) to assess the expression confidence for each gene.
For RT–PCR analysis, poly(A)+ mRNA was purified with the Oligotex Direct mRNA kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified poly(A)+ RNA was reverse transcribed using the Thermoscript kit (Invitrogen). The cDNA was then used for PCR amplification for 35 cycles with gene-specific primers. PCR products were scanned after electrophoretic separation with a Typhoon Scanner, quantified using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences) and normalized for amplification of the Actin5c transcript. The sequence of primers used for RT–PCR and ChIP analysis are provided in the Supplementary Material.<br><br>ChIP
ChIP was performed according to Orlando et al. (29) and the protocol provided by Upstate () with some modifications. In brief, 1–2 × 108 Kc cells were prepared and fixed in 1% formaldehyde. Nuclei were isolated according to a standard procedure in Current Protocols (), then resuspended in 1.7 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS and protease inhibitors) and sonicated using a Branson sonifier 250. Chromatin fractions in the size range 0.2–0.8 kb were used to perform immunoprecipitation experiments. We used 5 μg affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies (#192 and #182 for HP1; HA antibody for control) and 1 ml of <span class="yellow">salmon</span> sperm DNA/protein-A-agarose (Upstate) pre-cleared chromatin lysate in each reaction. The mixture was then rotated at 4°C overnight and the recovered beads were washed twice with 1 ml of Low salt buffer (Upstate), once with High salt buffer (Upstate), once with LiCl buffer (Upstate) and twice with TE at 4°C for 8 min. ChIP DNA was extracted according to the standard procedures (29).<br><br>
RESULTS
Depletion of HP1 in <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> Kc cells
Various chromosomal defects in the cell cycle have been observed in embryos or larval tissues of <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> HP1 mutants (8,27). However, the presence of maternally loaded HP1 in embryos and the lethality of HP1 mutants at late larval stages have so far precluded a systematic study of the role of HP1 in cell-cycle regulation. Therefore, we used <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> Kc cells, a cell line derived from <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> embryos, as a model system to address this problem. HP1 transcripts were depleted using an RNAi-based approach (see Materials and Methods). The reduction in HP1 expression was measured both by RT–PCR and by western blotting analysis (Figure 1A). A significant reduction in the HP1 expression was already evident after 2 days treatment with HP1 dsRNA. Cells at day 8 showed a reduction in HP1 of ∼90% (Figure 1A) and were therefore used in all subsequent experiments.<br><br>Cell-cycle progression at S and G2/M phase is altered in the absence of HP1
The impact of HP1 loss on the cell cycle of Kc cells was determined using cell-cycle profile analysis of HP1-depleted and control cells. The percentage of cells in S phase was determined by BrdU incorporation, and total DNA content by 7-amino-actinomycin (7-AAD). The results showed that the depletion of HP1 (day 8) caused a decrease in S-phase cells of at least 4-fold, and a 2-fold decrease in G2/M-phase cells (Figure 1B), although no significant effect was found at the G1 phase. In addition, depletion of HP1 caused a greater than 7-fold increase in the number of apoptotic cells. These results, therefore, confirm that HP1 is an important regulator during the cell cycle, especially at the S and G2/M phases.<br><br>Cell-cycle regulators require HP1 to maintain their active transcription
To ask whether the cell-cycle defects were due to changes in the transcription of genes functionally involved in S phase and the G2/M phase, we next assessed global changes in gene transcription following depletion of HP1. Expression profile analysis was performed using total RNA isolated from both HP1-depleted Kc cells and control Kc cells, and an Affymetrix <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> chip. For each experiment, we used total RNA isolated from two independent HP1-depleted and control samples, and at least two independent experiments were performed.
The microarray analysis showed that loss of HP1 function in Kc cells resulted in alterations in transcription of >500 genes: ∼400 genes were down-regulated and ∼120 genes were up-regulated (>1.5-fold, ANOVA). The function of these genes ranged from cellular enzymes, signal transduction molecules, and membrane and cell structural proteins, to nucleic acid-binding proteins and cell-cycle regulators (Figure 2A). At the chromosomal level, the genes targeted by HP1 appeared to be distributed along all euchromatic chromosomal arms (data not shown), supporting a global role of HP1 in euchromatic gene regulation (20).
Among 60 known/predicted genes associated with DNA replication function, 15 were down-regulated in the absence of HP1 (Figure 2B). These included McM2, McM5, McM6 and CDC45L, which are required for processive DNA replication and correct chromosome condensation (30–32). Other genes involved in DNA replication, such as components of the origin recognition complex (Orc)—Orc4, Caf1, Gnf1, Dref1, DNA polymerase-γ and Tam—were also down-regulated (Figure 2B). Aurora B and inner centromere protein (INCENP), known to be required for kinetochore assembly, chromosome condensation and bipolar chromosome attachment during mitosis (33), also showed a reduction in transcription. A similar loss of transcription was observed in Bub1 and Bub3 (Figure 2B), encoding mitotic checkpoint control proteins (34,35). Loss function of Bub1 has been shown to cause chromatin bridges to extend between the two separating groups of chromosomes, and extensive chromosome fragmentation in anaphase cells (35).
We confirmed the changes in the transcription of cell-cycle regulators using semi-quantitative RT–PCR, which gave results consistent with the microarray analysis. In addition, cell-cycle regulator genes, such as McM3, McM7 and Asp (abnormal spindle), were also confirmed to be down-regulated (Figure 2C). Collectively, these results demonstrate that HP1 is indeed involved in the regulation of transcription of cell-cycle regulators.<br><br>HP1 is required for Aurora B distribution and histone H3 phosphorylation
INCENP is localized to the centromeric region of chromosomes at metaphase and the spindle midzone at anaphase, which then targets Aurora B, a kinase essential for histone H3 ser10 phosphorylation, to these sites (36). Loss of function of both these ‘chromosomal passenger’ proteins causes abnormal chromosomal segregation at metaphase, as well as certain cytokinesis defects (36,37). The loss of transcription of both INCENP and Aurora B after depletion of HP1, therefore, raised the possibility that localization of Aurora B (Figure 3 and data not shown) may be altered. Staining of HP1-depleted Kc cells with anti-Aurora B antibodies indeed revealed an altered localization of Aurora B and, in a number of cases, a complete loss of Aurora B (Figure 3A). Consistent with the loss function of Aurora B, the spindles in the metaphase cells were also disorganized, with a large number of cells showing an altered prometaphase chromosome alignment (Figure 3A). Some showed extensive chromosome fragmentation (Figure 3B), or the presence of a third spindle pole-like structure as indicated by beta-tubulin (Figure 3A). At telophase, we observed defective separating cells with an extra cell envelope-like structure without nuclei (Figure 3A). Chromatin bridges or lagging chromatids at telophase were also evident in some cells (Figure 3C); however, in some cases, localization of Aurora B appeared not to be affected, arguing that other pathways are possibly involved.
We next analyzed changes in histone H3 serine 10 phosphorylation, since the loss of transcription of INCENP is known to affect localization of Aurora B (33), which is essential in the regulation of histone H3 phosphorylation (36). Total cell extracts from HP1-depleted Kc cells were analyzed by western blotting (Figure 3D). The results indeed showed a severalfold reduction in H3 ser10 phosphorylation after depletion of HP1, consistent with the functional disruption of INCENP and Aurora B in the absence of HP1.<br><br>HP1 directly targets genes encoding cell-cycle regulators in euchromatin
To test whether the loss of transcription of genes involved in DNA replication and mitosis was a direct effect of the loss of HP1, we performed a ChIP analysis to determine whether HP1 is physically associated with these genes. Chromatin lysates from formaldehyde-fixed Kc cells were sonicated into small chromatin fragments (0.2–0.8 kb) and immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies against <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> HP1. As a control, we used a mock precipitation (beads only) and polyclonal antibodies against HA. Our ChIP results showed that known transposable elements distributed in heterochromatin, such as F-element, TART and 1360 (7,38), were all enriched in HP1 binding (Figure 4), which is also consistent with a previous study (20).
Using the same ChIP DNA material, we then attempted to determine whether HP1 was enriched in genes involved in DNA replication. Primers were designed to cover the promoter regions of selected genes. The results showed that McM3, McM5 and Tam were all enriched in HP1 binding (Figure 4). However, McM7 appeared to be HP1-negative, although its transcription was also affected by the loss of HP1 function. Genes essential for mitosis, such as Aurora B, were also HP1-positive (Figure 4). These results demonstrate that these cell-cycle regulator genes are directly targeted by HP1 in their promoter regions.<br><br>
DISCUSSION
In this study, we used microarray and RT–PCR techniques to demonstrate that transcription of cell-cycle regulators is misregulated in the absence of HP1. Certain defects in S phase may be a direct consequence of the loss of transcription of DNA replication genes such as McM2, McM5, McM6, CDC45L, Orc4 and others, since these genes have been functionally implicated in the initiation of DNA replication and/or the progression of replication forks (39). Depletion or mutation of these genes has been shown to result in DNA damage (32), the blockage of replication forks (39), increased chromosome loss/genome instability, and defective condensation (30).
The reduction in the number of cells in G2/M phase may be a consequence of the reduction in transcription or functional disruption of INCENP, Aurora B, Bub1, and Bub3 (34,36). Chromosome segregation defects, such as chromosome fragmentation and chromatin bridges in anaphase/telophase cells, and certain cytokinesis defects in HP1-depleted cells, mimic the phenotype of cells with loss function of INCENP, Aurora B or Bub1 (35–37). The mislocalization of Aurora B in the absence of HP1 is also consistent with the loss of transcription and functional disruption of INCENP (37), and the reduction in Aurora B transcription may be partially responsible for the observed chromosomal defects, including loss of histone H3 phosphorylation at serine 10.
HP1 is also known to physically interact with certain components of replication complexes such as ORCs and MCMs (30,40,41), with the inner centromere protein INCENP (42) and the chromatin assembly factor CAF1 (43) promoting delivery of HP1 to heterochromatin sites (44). Loss of HP1 is, therefore, expected to cause disruption to such HP1-associated complexes, and will partially contribute to the chromatin/chromosomal defects in HP1 mutants (8,27) and HP1-depleted Kc cells. It is therefore well possible that the loss of transcription of these cell-cycle regulator genes, and consequent disruption of HP1 functional complexes or heterochromatin structure, all contributed to the cell-cycle defects observed.
The ChIP assay supports the hypothesis that the loss of transcription of cell-cycle regulator genes is a direct effect of the lack of HP1. Aurora B, McM3, and McM5 were all bound by HP1 at their promoter regions, although other cell-cycle regulators, such as McM7, were HP1-negative, implying that the altered transcription in these genes might be a secondary effect of the loss of HP1.
A previous study in <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> Kc cells (20) employed an approach based on the ectopic expression of a fusion protein of HP1 with a prokaryotic DNA adenine methyltransferase and identified a number of methylated targets in the genome. In this study, MCM3 and MCM5 were not found to be methylated, indicating lack of association with HP1. On the other hand, heterochromatin repeats, such F-element and 1360, were consistently found to be HP1-enriched both here and in the previous study. It remains to be determined whether these discrepancies are due to the different experimental systems used. However, we note that the previous study was performed using a cDNA array, while we observe binding of endogenous HP1 at the promoter of these genes. Similarly, another study using chromatin immunoprecipitation in larvae also showed few HP1-positive genes that were not detected in Kc cells by the Dam ID approach (21).
A large number of genes affected by the loss of <span class="yellow">D.melanogaster</span> HP1 in larval tissues (21) seem to be different from that in embryonic Kc cells. The change in the transcription of Aurora B and few cell-cycle regulators reported in this study is also not found among the HP1-affected genes at larval stage (21). This may be due to specific role(s) of HP1 in different stages of development. Alternatively, it is also possible that the impact of HP1 in the transcription of cell-cycle regulators in proliferating cells is underestimated when performing the analyses on larval tissues, and thus on mixed populations of both proliferating and differentiating/differentiated cells.
HP1 is generally known as a transcriptional repressor, as supported by several lines of evidence: silencing of a euchromatic reporter gene in heterochromatin requires HP1 (10,11), tethering of HP1 next to a euchromatic reporter gene causes silencing (45), and the repression of genes within euchromatic region 31 bound by HP1 is relieved in the absence of HP1 (46). In contrast, genes in heterochromatin, known as heterochromatic genes, such as light and rolled, seem to require HP1 to maintain their active transcription (47,48). The level of transcription of heterochromatic genes was dramatically reduced in a mutated HP1 background (47–49). It was therefore proposed that HP1 may function as a positive regulator of transcription of these genes (50,51), although the exact regulation mechanism remains unclear. A study of heat-shock genes found that HP1 is associated with RNA transcripts in the coding region, and is also a positive regulator of their transcription (52,53). The chromatin association of HP1 at the promoter region of active euchromatic genes demonstrated from this work and others, and its independence from histone H3K9 methylation (21), all suggest that mechanism whereby HP1 modulates transcription of euchromatic genes is potentially distinct from its role in heterochromatin formation.
Collectively, the results of this study demonstrate that HP1 plays an essential role in cell-cycle progression, and support the view that HP1, in addition to its role in heterochromatin, can act as a positive transcriptional regulator of euchromatic genes.<br><br>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL

<h3>pmcA1526545</h3>B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) isoforms in systemic lupus erythematosus: disease activity correlates better with blood leukocyte BLyS mRNA levels than with plasma BLyS protein levels
Abstract
Considerable evidence points to a role for B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) overproduction in <span class="yellow">murine</span> and <span class="yellow">human</span> systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Nevertheless, the correlation between circulating levels of BLyS protein and disease activity in <span class="yellow">human</span> SLE is modest at best. This may be due to an inadequacy of the former to reflect endogenous BLyS overproduction faithfully, in that steady-state protein levels are affected not just by production rates but also by rates of peripheral utilization and excretion. Increased levels of BLyS mRNA may better reflect increased in vivo BLyS production, and therefore they may correlate better with biologic and clinical sequelae of BLyS overexpression than do circulating levels of BLyS protein. Accordingly, we assessed peripheral blood leukocyte levels of BLyS mRNA isoforms (full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS) and plasma BLyS protein levels in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with SLE, and correlated these levels with laboratory and clinical features. BLyS protein, full-length BLyS mRNA, and ΔBLyS mRNA levels were greater in SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> (n = 60) than in rheumatoid arthritis <span class="yellow">patients</span> (n = 60) or normal control individuals (n = 30). Although full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS mRNA levels correlated significantly with BLyS protein levels in the SLE cohort, BLyS mRNA levels were more closely associated with serum immunoglobulin levels and SLE Disease Activity Index scores than were BLyS protein levels. Moreover, changes in SLE Disease Activity Index scores were more closely associated with changes in BLyS mRNA levels than with changes in BLyS protein levels among the 37 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> from whom repeat blood samples were obtained. Thus, full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS mRNA levels are elevated in SLE and are more closely associated with disease activity than are BLyS protein levels. BLyS mRNA levels may be a helpful biomarker in the clinical monitoring of SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>.<br><br>Introduction
B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS; a trademark of <span class="yellow">Human</span> Genome Sciences, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA) is a 285-amino-acid member of the tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily [1-3]. A causal relation between constitutive overproduction of BLyS and development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like illness has incontrovertibly been established in <span class="yellow">mice</span>. BLyS-transgenic <span class="yellow">mice</span> often develop SLE-like features as they age [3-5], and SLE-prone (NZB × NZW)F1 (BWF1) and MRL-lpr/lpr <span class="yellow">mice</span> respond clinically to treatment with BLyS antagonists (decreased disease progression and improved survival) [3,6].
Considerable inferential evidence points to a role for BLyS overproduction in <span class="yellow">human</span> SLE as well. Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated elevated circulating levels of BLyS in 20–30% of <span class="yellow">human</span> SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> tested at a single point in time [7,8]. Moreover, a 12-month longitudinal study documented persistently elevated serum BLyS levels in about 25% of SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> and intermittently elevated serum BLyS levels in an additional 25% of <span class="yellow">patients</span> [9]. Remarkably, circulating BLyS levels did not correlate with disease activity (measured using the SLE Disease Activity Index [SLEDAI]) in these cross-sectional or longitudinal studies [7-9]. Although a statistically significant correlation between circulating BLyS levels and SLEDAI has been appreciated in a more recent 24-month longitudinal study of 245 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> (with >1,700 plasma samples analyzed) [10], the correlation remains weak.
The limited correlation between circulating BLyS protein levels and disease activity in these studies may have exposed an inadequacy of the former to reflect faithfully endogenous BLyS overproduction. In addition to the rate of BLyS protein production, several other factors (for example, utilization and excretion) can affect circulating BLyS protein levels. Although there are no practicable means of directly measuring in vivo BLyS production per se in <span class="yellow">humans</span>, the level of BLyS mRNA may serve as a better surrogate marker of in vivo BLyS production than does the level of BLyS protein. Candidate BLyS mRNA isoforms include the full-length BLyS mRNA isoform, which encodes the full-length protein, and the alternatively spliced ΔBLyS mRNA isoform, which encodes a protein with a small peptide deletion [11]. (ΔBLyS does not bind to cells expressing BLyS receptors, and therefore it has no agonistic activity. Moreover, ΔBLyS can form heterotrimers with full-length BLyS, thereby actually functioning as a dominant-negative antagonist of BLyS activity.)
In this report we demonstrate that peripheral blood leukocytes from SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> express elevated mRNA levels of both full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS relative to those levels expressed by <span class="yellow">patients</span> with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or by normal control individuals. In the SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>, both full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS mRNA levels are more closely associated with disease activity (SLEDAI) than are BLyS protein levels. Accordingly, BLyS mRNA levels may be a helpful biomarker in the clinical monitoring of SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>.<br><br>Materials and methods
General details
This study was approved by the institutional review boards of the University of Southern California and the Scripps Research Institute. All <span class="yellow">participants</span> gave their written informed consent before participation in this study.<br><br><span class="yellow">Participants</span>
<span class="yellow">Patients</span> receiving outpatient medical care at the rheumatology clinics of the Los Angeles County + University of Southern California Medical Center were recruited into the study. Diagnoses of SLE (n = 60) or RA (n = 60) were based on established clinical criteria [12]. Healthy control individuals (n = 30) were recruited from Los Angeles County + University of Southern California Medical Center and University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine personnel. No exclusions were made on any basis other than an inability to give informed consent. Each <span class="yellow">patient</span>'s sex, race, age, and medications at the time of the phlebotomy were recorded (Table 1).
Based solely on the <span class="yellow">patient</span>'s willingness to donate a second blood sample, repeat blood samples were collected from 37 of the SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> 147–511 days (median 371 days) after collection of the first samples. These <span class="yellow">patients</span> were not selected on the basis of any demographic, clinical, or laboratory feature.
Clinical disease activity for the SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> was assessed using the SLEDAI [13] and using a modified SLEDAI that excludes the contribution of anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies from the total score. Each <span class="yellow">patient</span>'s medical chart was reviewed for results of standard clinical laboratory tests within the previous or subsequent 1-month period.<br><br>Plasma BLyS determination
Whole venous blood was centrifuged to yield plasma and a buffy coat. The plasma was harvested, stored at -70°C, and assayed for BLyS levels by ELISA [8,14] using Fab fragments of the capture antibody rather than the whole antibody to reduce assay interference by rheumatoid factor. The lower limit of detection in this assay is 0.3 ng/ml. For statistical purposes, plasma samples with BLyS concentrations below the lower limit of detection were assigned a value of 0.25 ng/ml.<br><br>Blood BLyS mRNA determination
The buffy coat from centrifuged whole blood was harvested, added to RNAlater™ (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) at a 1:4 vol/vol ratio for RNA stabilization, stored at -70°C, and assayed for full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS mRNA levels by real-time PCR. Total RNA was purified from buffy coat samples using RNAeasy miniprep kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), and contaminating genomic DNA was removed by DNAse-I digestion. One-tenth volume of total RNA was used as template in the first-strand cDNA reaction using oligo-dT and the Superscript III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Duplicate samples of cDNA were amplified with primers against β-actin, full-length BLyS, or ΔBLyS: β-actin sense 5'-CGAGAAGATGACCCAGATCATGT-3'; β-actin anti-sense 5'-GGCATACCCCTCGTAGATGG-3'; full-length BLyS sense 5'-GCAGACAGTGAAACACCAACTATAC-3'; ΔBLyS sense 5'-CAGAAGAAACAGGATCTTACACAT-3'; and full-length BLyS/ΔBLyS anti-sense 5'-TGCCAGCTGAATAGCAGGAATTAT-3'.
A 165 bp amplicon for β-actin was PCR-amplified using the 7900 HT ABI Prism machine (Qiagen) with annealing at 65°C. A 296 bp amplicon for full-length BLyS was PCR-amplified, with annealing at 64°C. A 270 bp amplicon for ΔBLyS was PCR-amplified with annealing at 61°C. The annealing conditions for full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS were determined so that each primer set remained specific to the respective BLyS isoform and yielded a PCR efficiency similar to those of cloned cDNA standards. Melting curve analysis revealed a single peak for each gene amplified. The threshold cycle (Ct) values for each reaction were determined using Sequence Detection System software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Results are presented as ratios of full-length BLyS or ΔBLyS mRNA to β-actin mRNA, which were calculated using the following formulae:

BLyS was bound to microtiter plates by first coating the plates with streptavidin and then adding biotinylated recombinant BLyS. Using these plates as the capture reagent, plasma samples were incubated, and <span class="blue">horseradish</span> peroxidase-conjugated anti-<span class="yellow">human</span> IgA/IgM/IgG (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL, USA; 1:20,000 final dilution) or <span class="blue">horseradish</span> peroxidase-conjugated anti-<span class="yellow">human</span> IgG (Southern Biotechnology; 1:10,000 final dilution) were used as the detector reagents.<br><br>Statistical analysis
All analyses were performed using SigmaStat software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Results that did not follow a normal distribution were log-transformed to achieve normality. Parametric testing between two matched or unmatched groups was performed using the paired or unpaired t test, respectively. Parametric testing among three or more groups was performed using one-way analysis of variance. When log-transformation failed to generate normally distributed data or the equal variance test was not satisfied, nonparametric testing was performed using the Mann–Whitney rank sum test between two groups and by Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance on ranks among three or more groups. Correlations were determined using Pearson product moment correlation for interval data and using Spearman rank order correlation for ordinal data or for interval data that did not follow a normal distribution. Nominal data were analyzed using χ2 analysis-of-contingency tables.<br><br>
Results
Elevated plasma BLyS levels and blood levels of full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS mRNA isoforms in systemic lupus erythematosus <span class="yellow">patients</span>
Previous reports of elevated circulating BLyS levels in SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> were based on a BLyS ELISA that utilized a whole (unfragmented) capture anti-BLyS monoclonal antibody [7-9]. Since the publication of these reports, it has been recognized that the presence of rheumatoid factor can potentially interfere with the assay and lead to spurious overestimation of the true circulating BLyS levels (<span class="yellow">Human</span> Genome Sciences, Inc.; unpublished observations). To mitigate potential interference from rheumatoid factor, the BLyS ELISA has been modified and the capture anti-BLyS monoclonal antibody is now utilized as a Fab fragment. Despite the changes in the ELISA format, our findings are entirely consistent with those of the previous reports. Plasma BLyS levels were significantly greater in the SLE group than in either RA or normal control group (P < 0.001; Figure 1a). Arbitrary assignment of the 95th percentile value among the normal control individuals as the upper limit of 'normal' revealed that two of the 30 normal control individuals, 15 of the 60 RA <span class="yellow">patients</span>, and 29 of the 60 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> harbored elevated plasma BLyS levels (P < 0.001).
Overexpression of BLyS in SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> was also established by measuring BLyS mRNA levels normalized to β-actin mRNA levels in peripheral blood leukocytes (buffy coats). The geometric mean full-length BLyS mRNA and ΔBLyS mRNA levels among the SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> were each significantly greater than those among the RA <span class="yellow">patients</span> and normal control individuals, respectively (P < 0.001 for each; Figure 1b,c). Arbitrary assignment of the 95th percentile values for full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS mRNA levels among the normal control individuals as the upper limits of 'normal' revealed that two of the 30 normal control individuals, four of the 60 RA <span class="yellow">patients</span>, and 20 of the 60 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> had elevated full-length BLyS mRNA levels (P < 0.001), and that two of the 30 normal control individuals, three of the 60 RA <span class="yellow">patients</span>, and 19 of the 60 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> had elevated ΔBLyS mRNA levels (P < 0.001). Levels of full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS mRNA strongly correlated with each other (r = 0.703; P < 0.001) in the SLE cohort, and plasma BLyS levels also correlated significantly with levels of each BLyS isoform (r = 0.429, P < 0.001; and r = 0.290, P = 0.024, respectively). Among these SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>, none of the measured BLyS parameters correlated with <span class="yellow">patient</span> age, sex, race, or daily dose of corticosteroids (data not shown). Because the racial composition of the normal cohort was not as predominantly Hispanic as were those of the RA and SLE cohorts, we assessed the BLyS parameters in the respective Hispanic subpopulations. As for the entire populations, values for SLE were significantly greater than those for either RA or normal controls (P ≤ 0.004; data not shown).<br><br>Correlations between BLyS parameters and plasma immunoglobulin levels
BLyS is a potent B cell survival factor [15-21], and administration of exogenous BLyS to <span class="yellow">mice</span> leads to B cell expansion and hypergammaglobulinemia [1]. Previous studies with numbers of SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> greater than were included in the present study documented a modest but significant correlation between serum levels of BLyS and IgG [8,10]. In our SLE cohort of limited size, plasma BLyS levels failed to show significant correlations with plasma levels of total immunoglobulin, IgG, or IgA. In contrast, full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS mRNA levels correlated significantly with each (Figure 2). (None of the BLyS parameters correlated with plasma IgM levels.) The absence of significant correlation between plasma BLyS levels and the immunoglobulin parameters also persisted when just the 53 <span class="yellow">patients</span> with detectable plasma BLyS levels were considered (r = -0.133, P = 0.346 for total immunoglobulin; r = -0.048, P = 0.734 for IgG; and r = 0.033, P = 0.817 for IgA).<br><br>Correlations between BLyS parameters and disease activity
Previous studies either have failed to demonstrate a significant correlation between disease activity and circulating BLyS levels [7-9] or have detected only a weak correlation between the two [10]. Consonant with those studies, we identified no significant correlation between plasma BLyS levels and SLEDAI in our cohort of 60 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> (Figure 3a). The failure to demonstrate a significant correlation cannot be attributed to a skewing of the results by the <span class="yellow">patients</span> in whom plasma BLyS levels were below the limit of detection, because no significant correlation was detected among the 53 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> in whom plasma BLyS levels were in the detectable range (r = 0.185, P = 0.183). In contrast, a significant correlation between SLEDAI and full-length BLyS mRNA levels was readily discernible (Figure 3b). A trend toward a correlation between SLEDAI and ΔBLyS mRNA levels was also observed, although it did not achieve statistical significance (Figure 3c).
A component of the SLEDAI is the presence of circulating anti-dsDNA antibodies. Because circulating BLyS levels may affect the presence and/or titers of circulating anti-dsDNA antibodies [7-10], we assessed correlations between the individual BLyS parameters and a modified SLEDAI that excludes any consideration of anti-dsDNA antibodies. As with the unmodified SLEDAI, the modified SLEDAI did not correlate with plasma BLyS levels (Figure 3d) either among the SLE cohort overall or among the 53 <span class="yellow">patients</span> in whom plasma BLyS levels were in the detectable range (r = 0.160, P = 0.252), but it significantly correlated with full-length BLyS mRNA levels (Figure 3e) and exhibited a trend toward correlation with ΔBLyS mRNA levels (Figure 3f). Thus, the stronger correlations between BLyS mRNA levels and disease activity cannot solely be explained by any effects that BLyS may have on anti-dsDNA antibodies per se.
Moreover, among the 37 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> who were evaluated on two separate occasions, trends toward correlation were appreciated between changes in the unmodified or modified SLEDAI and changes in full-length BLyS or ΔBLyS mRNA levels but not changes in plasma BLyS levels (Figure 4). These results cannot be ascribed to changes in medications taken by the <span class="yellow">patients</span>, because changes in neither disease activity nor in any of the BLyS parameters correlated with changes in the doses of corticosteroids or cytotoxics taken by the <span class="yellow">patients</span> (data not shown). The failure to demonstrate a meaningful association between changes in SLEDAI score and changes in plasma BLyS protein levels cannot be attributed to a skewing of the results by the <span class="yellow">patients</span> in whom plasma BLyS levels were below the limit of detection, because the absence of association between the two persisted among the 27 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> in whom plasma BLyS levels were in the detectable range in both samples (r = -0.069, P = 0.727 for plasma BLyS versus unmodified SLEDAI; r = -0.020, P = 0.919 for plasma BLyS versus modified SLEDAI).<br><br>Lack of correlation between levels of BLyS mRNA isoforms and percentages of individual leukocyte cell types
Among cells in peripheral blood, BLyS is predominantly expressed by cells of the myeloid lineage (monocytes and neutrophils) [1,14,22,23]. Accordingly, a shift in the differential leukocyte count away from lymphocytes to monocytes and/or neutrophils could substantially alter BLyS mRNA results. Because of the limited amount of blood we were permitted to obtain from the SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> (consequent to the high prevalence of anemia among these <span class="yellow">patients</span>), we were unable to purify the individual leukocyte populations for BLyS mRNA analysis. Nevertheless, to demonstrate that the elevated BLyS mRNA levels in SLE did not simply reflect a shift in differential leukocyte count, we assessed the correlations between the individual BLyS parameters on the one hand and the percentages of blood neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes on the other. No correlations were appreciated (Figure 5).<br><br>Presence of anti-BLyS autoantibodies in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with systemic lupus erythematosus
The poorer correlation between plasma BLyS protein levels and disease activity compared with that between BLyS mRNA levels and disease activity was striking. <span class="yellow">Patients</span> with SLE frequently develop autoantibodies against self-antigens, and so some of the SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> might have harbored autoantibodies to BLyS. Such autoantibodies could have complexed with BLyS and enhanced its clearance, thereby masking BLyS overproduction. Alternatively, such autoantibodies might have sterically blocked the epitopes recognized by the detecting antibodies in the in vitro ELISA. In this case, measured BLyS levels would have been spuriously reduced, again masking BLyS overproduction.
In our cohort, IgA/IgM/IgG anti-BLyS antibodies were detected in six out of the 60 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>. Such autoantibodies were also detected in two out of 60 RA <span class="yellow">patients</span> and in one out of 30 normal control individuals, demonstrating that anti-BLyS autoantibodies are not restricted to SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>. IgG anti-BLyS autoantibodies were detected in 3 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> but in no RA <span class="yellow">patients</span> or normal control individuals.<br><br>
Discussion
Elevated blood levels of BLyS protein and mRNA are well described features of <span class="yellow">human</span> SLE [7-9]. We confirmed these observations in our study and extended them by documenting increases not just in levels of full-length BLyS mRNA but also in levels of ΔBLyS mRNA (Figure 1). Of note, BLyS mRNA levels were elevated in SLE but not in RA, raising the possibility that BLyS overproduction in SLE is systemic whereas BLyS overproduction in RA may be more focused to the affected arthritic joints [24]. The modestly elevated plasma BLyS protein levels in RA <span class="yellow">patients</span> may reflect, at least in part, release of locally overproduced BLyS into the circulation.
The relationship between circulating BLyS protein levels and disease activity was addressed in several previous studies, but significant correlations between the two measures did not emerge [7-9]. In the largest study to date, a 2-year longitudinal study of 245 <span class="yellow">patients</span> in which more than 1,700 plasma samples were analyzed, a significant but weak correlation between the two was appreciated [10]. In the present study, a significant correlation between plasma BLyS protein levels and disease activity was again not realized (Figure 3a,d).
The weak, at best, correlation between circulating BLyS levels and disease activity is seemingly rather surprising. There is a clear-cut association in BlyS transgenic <span class="yellow">mice</span> between BLyS overexpression and development of SLE-like features [3-5], and treatment of SLE-prone <span class="yellow">mice</span> with BLyS antagonists retards the progression of disease and improves survival [3,6]. Moreover, development of precocious glomerular pathology in autoimmune-prone <span class="yellow">mice</span> correlates strongly with circulating BLyS levels [25].
The likely explanation for the weak correlation between circulating BLyS levels and disease activity in <span class="yellow">human</span> SLE is not that disease activity in SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> is insensitive to the degree of BLyS overproduction. Rather, a more tenable explanation is that circulating BLyS levels in <span class="yellow">human</span> SLE do not always accurately reflect excessive endogenous BLyS production. We can identify at least three nonmutually exclusive mechanisms to explain a dissociation between the two.
First, SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> frequently develop autoantibodies to a myriad of self-targets (for example, erythrocytes, lymphocytes). Indeed, we detected circulating IgA/IgM/IgG anti-BLyS autoantibodies in 10% (6/60) of the tested SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>, and we detected circulating IgG anti-BLyS autoantibodies in 5% (3/60). These percentages may be underestimates of the true prevalence of anti-BLyS autoantibodies, because some of these autoantibodies may be saturated in vivo with circulating BLyS, rendering them incapable of binding to BLyS in the in vitro detection assay. We do not yet know whether the anti-BLyS autoantibodies are functionally neutralizing but, regardless, such autoantibodies could enhance the clearance of BLyS and/or interfere with in vitro detection of BLyS, thereby masking endogenous BLyS overproduction.
Second, increased urinary excretion of BLyS has been reported in SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>, especially among those with clinically overt renal involvement [26]. At least four of the <span class="yellow">patients</span> we studied manifested nephrotic-range proteinuria (≥3 g/24 hours), and so urinary loss of BLyS was probably substantial in at least these <span class="yellow">patients</span>. A validated assay for urinary BLyS detection has not yet been developed so we were unable to quantify urinary BLyS levels. Once an assay for urinary BLyS levels is validated, we should be able to assess the effect of urinary BLyS excretion on circulating BLyS levels.
Third, BLyS promotes in vivo expansion of B cells [1]. Freshly isolated SLE B cells, despite intact surface expression of BLyS receptors, bind less biotinylated BLyS ex vivo than do freshly isolated normal B cells [27]. Although other interpretations are possible, the most likely explanation is that BLyS receptors on B cells in SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> are occupied in vivo by soluble BLyS. Accordingly, it is likely that BLyS receptors expressed by the expanded B cell population do bind BLyS and remove it from the circulation, resulting in a homeostatic pathway that modulates the effects of BLyS overproduction on circulating BLyS levels. Indeed, circulating levels of BLyS rise with peripheral blood B cell depletion and fall with re-emergence of peripheral blood B cells in rituximab-treated RA or SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> [28,29], highlighting this inverse relationship between circulating BLyS levels and B cell load. Moreover, one of the hallmarks of active disease in <span class="yellow">human</span> SLE is the increased percentages of activated B cells and plasma cells in peripheral blood [30-34], probably reflecting increased systemic numbers of activated B cells and plasma cells. Although not yet formally tested, differential BLyS receptor expression by these cells compared with expression by nonactivated B cells may result in increased peripheral BLyS utilization, further dampening the effects of BLyS overproduction on circulating protein levels.
To circumvent these confounding processes, we used BLyS mRNA levels as a surrogate marker of endogenous BLyS production. Overall, the correlations between disease activity and either full-length BLyS or ΔBLyS mRNA levels were much stronger than that between disease activity and BLyS protein levels (Figures 3 and 4). This was the case regardless of whether we used the standard SLEDAI or the modified SLEDAI as a measure of disease activity. These correlations were not spurious ones consequent to shifts in percentages of leukocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood, because BLyS mRNA levels did not correlate with percentages of blood neutrophils, monocytes, or lymphocytes (Figure 5).
A similar pattern was observed between plasma immunoglobulin levels and the BLyS parameters, with plasma levels of total immunoglobulin, IgG, and IgA correlating significantly with full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS mRNA levels but not with plasma BLyS levels (Figure 2). These significant correlations between full-length BLyS or ΔBLyS mRNA levels and plasma immunoglobulin levels again highlight the greater ability of BLyS mRNA levels, compared with plasma BLyS protein levels, to reflect ongoing BLyS overproduction.
At present, it is not known whether soluble ΔBLyS protein is present in the circulation of SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> or of normal individuals. Although full-length BLyS protein is readily cleaved and released from cells transfected with a vector containing <span class="yellow">murine</span> full-length BLyS, ΔBLyS protein is not cleaved or released from <span class="yellow">murine</span> ΔBLyS transfectants [11]. Given the strong similarities between <span class="yellow">murine</span> and <span class="yellow">human</span> full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS, it is likely that <span class="yellow">human</span> soluble ΔBLyS protein is also not cleaved from the cell surface and released into the circulation. Moreover, soluble ΔBLyS protein is not released from cells transfected with a vector containing just the extracellular domain of <span class="yellow">human</span> ΔBLyS (which encodes the soluble protein; A.L. Gavin, unpublished observations). Whether this reflects rapid intracellular degradation of soluble ΔBLyS or some other impediment to its release remains unknown. Regardless, if the inability to release soluble ΔBLyS in vitro faithfully recapitulates in vivo biology, then the stronger associations between SLE disease activity and full-length BLyS or ΔBLyS mRNA levels compared with that between SLE disease activity and BLyS protein levels could not be attributable to interference by biologically inactive (inhibitory) ΔBLyS protein in the BLyS protein detection ELISA. Importantly, even if soluble ΔBLyS protein is present in the circulation and is detected by the BLyS protein detection ELISA, then the stronger correlations between SLE disease activity and full-length BLyS or ΔBLyS mRNA levels than that between disease activity and total BLyS (including ΔBLyS) protein levels suggest that full-length BLyS and/or ΔBLyS mRNA levels may operationally serve as useful biomarkers of disease activity in SLE. Although the complexity and labor intensiveness associated with quantitative real-time PCR may render measurement of BLyS mRNA levels impracticable for routine clinical practice, such measurement could readily be incorporated into clinical trials and yield valuable information.
Longitudinal observations in large numbers of SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> will be necessary to establish or refute the utility of full-length BLyS and/or ΔBLyS mRNA to subserve this clinically vital function.
Although expression of the two major BLyS isoforms was highly coordinate among SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>, there were several <span class="yellow">patients</span> in whom ΔBLyS mRNA levels were markedly greater than or less than the expected values based on full-length BLyS mRNA levels (data not shown). This raises the possibility that dysregulation of ΔBLyS may contribute to overall BLyS dysregulation in at least some SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>. It is known that interferon-γ, interleukin-10, interferon-α, and CD154 can upregulate full-length BLyS mRNA levels [14,22,35], but it is not known what effects these or other cytokines/cell-surface structures have on ΔBLyS expression. Further investigation of the regulation of ΔBLyS and the differential expression of BLyS isoforms is certainly warranted.
Although the associations between full-length BLyS and/or ΔBLyS mRNA levels and disease activity in SLE were usually strong when the SLE cohort was analyzed in aggregate, there were several SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> in whom BLyS mRNA levels were quite high despite little objective ongoing disease activity, and there were several SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> in whom BLyS mRNA levels were low despite considerable ongoing disease activity. One must recognize that the bulk of the pathogenic autoimmune responses probably takes place in the spleen and lymph nodes, rather than in the peripheral blood, where myeloid lineage cells (for example, dendritic cells) produce BLyS and support B cell survival and expansion [36]. Local BLyS production in the secondary lymphoid tissues will be more important to the development and maintenance of an autoimmune response than will remote BLyS levels in the circulation. Because at least some autoreactive B cells may be more sensitive to BLyS-mediated survival signals than non-autoreactive B cells [37,38], local increases in BLyS production could preferentially promote expansion of autoreactive B cells. These cells, in turn, could activate autoreactive T cells by presenting autoantigen to them, and some of the autoreactive B cells would respond to T cell derived signals and mature into (pathogenic) autoantibody secreting plasma cells. In contrast to <span class="yellow">murine</span> studies, in which investigators can readily harvest and analyze lymphoid and myeloid lineage cells from any site (for example, spleen, bone marrow), such is not the case for <span class="yellow">human</span> studies. Peripheral blood is the only site readily accessible for <span class="yellow">human</span> studies, and it is possible that, at least in some <span class="yellow">patients</span>, BLyS mRNA levels in circulating leukocytes do not reflect local BLyS production in the secondary lymphoid tissues.
One must also recognize that disease activity in SLE is not solely driven by B cells. Systemic inflammation and SLE flares can be triggered via B cell independent means. Not all SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> treated with a B cell depleting course of rituximab experience clinical remission [39], strongly pointing to the importance of non-B cells in disease pathogenesis/maintenance. Conversely, not all pathogenic B cells necessarily require high levels of BLyS to effect their pathogenicity. <span class="yellow">Murine</span> studies have unequivocally documented B cell subpopulations that do not depend upon BLyS for their survival [40-42]. Although <span class="yellow">mice</span> completely devoid of BLyS have reduced numbers of mature B cells and harbor reduced levels of immunoglobulin, these reductions are incomplete. Thus, it is possible that some SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> harbor pathogenic B cells that are relatively insensitive to BLyS and could drive considerable disease activity even in the context of low endogenous BLyS production. Conversely, <span class="yellow">patients</span> with high BLyS mRNA levels may be those <span class="yellow">patients</span> whose disease is strongly driven by BLyS and may be especially helped by BLyS antagonist therapy. Future clinical trials should be able to establish whether the BLyS mRNA levels are good predictors of response to such agents.<br><br>Conclusion
Plasma total immunoglobulin, IgG, and IgA levels and disease activity (as measured by SLEDAI) in SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> correlate more closely with peripheral blood leukocyte levels of BLyS mRNA than with plasma levels of BLyS protein. These findings suggest that BLyS mRNA levels better reflect in vivo BLyS production than do circulating BLyS protein levels, and may be a useful biomarker in the clinical monitoring of SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>. These findings also support the premise that BLyS overexpression not only promotes development of disease but also actively contributes to the ongoing maintenance of disease in SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>. This reinforces the rationale underlying clinical trials with BLyS antagonists in SLE.<br><br>Abbreviations

<h3>pmcA2453154</h3>A Novel Role of the NRF2 Transcription Factor in the Regulation of Arsenite-Mediated Keratin 16 Gene Expression in <span class="yellow">Human</span> Keratinocytes
Abstract
Background
Inorganic sodium arsenite (iAs) is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant and is associated with an increased risk of skin hyperkeratosis and cancer.<br><br>Objectives
We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of the keratin 16 (K16) gene by iAs in the <span class="yellow">human</span> keratinocyte cell line HaCaT.<br><br>Methods
We performed reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, luciferase assays, Western blots, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays to determine the transcriptional regulation of the K16 gene by iAs. We used gene overexpression approaches to elucidate the nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2 related factor 2 (NRF2) involved in the K16 induction.<br><br>Results
iAs induced the mRNA and protein expression of K16. We also found that the expression of K16 was transcriptionally induced by iAs through activator protein-1–like sites and an antioxidant response element (ARE) in its gene promoter region. Treatment with iAs also enhanced the production and translocation of the NRF2 transcription factor, an ARE-binding protein, into the nucleus without modification of its mRNA expression. In addition, iAs elongated the half-life of the NRF2 protein. When overexpressed in HaCaT cells, NRF2 was also directly involved in not only the up-regulation of the detoxification gene thioredoxin but also K16 gene expression.<br><br>Conclusions
Our data clearly indicate that the K16 gene is a novel target of NRF2. Furthermore, our findings also suggest that NRF2 has opposing roles in the cell—in the activation of detoxification pathways and in promoting the development of skin disorders.<br><br><br><br>Inorganic sodium arsenite (iAs), a ubiquitous element, is one of the most toxic metals present in the natural environment (Bagla and Kaiser 1996). Arsenicals are found as naturally occurring constituents of soil, food, and drinking water (Wu et al. 1989; Yoshida et al. 2004), and exposure to iAs has been associated with a variety of disease outcomes, including disorders of the skin, urinary bladder, liver, and lung (Tchounwou et al. 2004). In particular, skin hyperkeratosis is a characteristic dermatologic lesion associated with ingestion of arsenic from contaminated groundwater (McLellan 2002; Yoshida et al. 2004). There is also a significant association between hyperkeratosis, nonmelanoma skin cancer (e.g., basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma), and Bowen disease (Col et al. 1999; Rossman et al. 2004). Furthermore, the pathologic features associated with arsenic-induced hyperkeratosis present as typical acanthotic types of psoriasis-like keratosis, characterized by the aberrant proliferation and terminal differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes (Lee et al. 2006). Many epidemiologic studies have shown that hyperkeratoses are the most frequent precursor lesions of some skin cancers (Bagla and Kaiser 1996; Col et al. 1999).
The keratins are the most prominent cytoskeletal proteins in keratinocytes and comprise a large family of proteins that form intermediate filament networks in all epithelial cell types (Moll et al. 1982). Keratin 16 (K16 ) and keratin 6 (K6) genes are constitutively expressed in a number of stratified epithelial levels, including the palmar and plantar epidermis (Moll et al. 1982). In skin diseases characterized by aberrant proliferation and differentiation, such as psoriasis and cancer, K16 is detectable at higher levels compared with normal tissue (Haider et al. 2006). Furthermore, the tissue-specific overexpression of wild-type K16 in the epidermis of transgenic <span class="yellow">mice</span> results in the hyperproliferation of keratinocytes and aberrant keratinization of cornified layers, leading to hyperkeratosis of the skin (Takahashi et al. 1994).
Nuclear factor erythoid-derived 2 related factor 2 (NRF2), a “cap ’n’ collar” basic leucine zipper transcription factor, regulates a transcriptional program that maintains cellular redox homeostasis and protects cells from oxidative stress and xenobiotic agents (Ishii et al. 2000; Moi et al. 1994). Several detoxifying and antioxidant genes, including glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1), and thioredoxin (TXN), are regulated by NRF2 through the antioxidant responsive element (ARE) in the respective promoter regions of these genes (McMahon et al. 2001; Wakabayashi et al. 2004). NRF2 is held in the cytoplasm by a cytoskeletal-associated specific inhibitory protein (kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1; KEAP1) under normal cellular redox state conditions, where it is continuously targeted by the proteasomal degradation pathway (McMahon et al. 2003). Upon exposure of the cell to oxidative stress or electrophiles, NRF2 can escape this KEAP1-mediated repression, translocate to the nucleus, and activate the expression of its target genes (Dinkova-Kostova et al. 2002; McMahon et al. 2003).
Recently, studies of Keap1–/–<span class="yellow">mice</span> have shown that NRF2 accumulates in the nucleus and constitutively activates the transcription of its target genes, even in the absence of stress signals (Wakabayashi et al. 2003). Most interestingly, however, the skin, esophagus, and forestomach of Keap1-deficient <span class="yellow">mice</span> show cornified layer and hyperkeratosis phenotypes. In addition, previous studies have also shown that the expression of NRF2 and ARE-controlled genes is induced by iAs in some cell types (Pi et al. 2003; Sakurai et al. 2005). Furthermore, histochemical analyses have indicated that the expression of K16 is increased in Bowen disease, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma induced by arsenicals (Yu et al. 1993). However, it remains to be determined whether NRF2 can regulate the transcriptional activation of K16 upon iAs exposure in <span class="yellow">human</span> keratinocytes. Hence, these findings prompted us to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of the K16 gene by iAs-induced NRF2 mediation.
Materials and Methods
Chemicals and reagents
A purified preparation of inorganic sodium arsenite (iAs; NaAsO2; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and added directly to the culture medium. A fresh iAs solution was prepared for each new experiment. Cycloheximide (CHX), dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO), and a protease inhibitor cocktail were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). CHX was dissolved in DMSO and stored –20°C until use.<br><br>Cells and culture conditions
The <span class="yellow">human</span> keratinocyte HaCaT cell line was obtained from N.E. Fusenig (German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany). Cells were maintained in monolayer cultures in 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37°C in Dulbecco’s modified Eagles medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal <span class="yellow">bovine</span> serum (FBS), 50 U/mL penicillin and 50 mg/mL streptomycin and nonessential amino acids (Gibco BRL, Paisley, UK).<br><br>RNA preparation and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis
We determined RNA expression levels by semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis as described previously (Sugioka et al. 2004). Total RNA was isolated from HaCaT cells using the GeneElute Mammalian Total RNA Kit (Sigma). The specific primers used for first-strand cDNA synthesis and PCR were as follows: K16 [forward, 5′-GAT GCT TGC TCT GAG AGG TC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CCA GCA AGA TCT GGT ACT CC-3′; Gene Bank accession no. NM_005557 (National Center for Biotechnology Information 2007)]; c-Jun (forward, 5′-CCT GTT GCG GCC CCG AAA CT-3′, and reverse, 5′-ACC ATG CCT GCC CCG TTG AC-3′; NM_002228); c-Fos (forward, 5′-TTT GCC TAA CCG CCA CGA TGA T-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTG CCG CTT TCT GCC ACC TC-3′; NM_005252); NRF2 (forward, 5′-AGA TTC ACA GGC CTT TCT CG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CAG CTC TCC CTA CCG TTG GA-3′; AF323119); KEAP1 (forward, 5′-CAG AGG TGG TGG TGT TGC TTA T-3′, and reverse, 5′-AGC TCG TTC ATG ATG CCA AAG-3′; NM_012289); TXN (forward, 5′-CAG GGG AAT GAA AGA AAG G-3′, and reverse, 5′-CAA GGT GAA GCA GAT CG-3′; NM_003329), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a loading control (forward, 5′-ACC ACA GTC CAT GCC ATC AC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA-3′, NM_002046). PCR products were separated on a 1.8% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide.<br><br>Western blot analysis
We performed Western blot analysis as described previously (Sugioka et al. 2004). Briefly, nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were extracted using the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For protein extraction, the cells were lysed in a buffer containing complete protease inhibitor cocktail. We measured protein concentrations using the DC Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, USA). Equal amounts of protein were then resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Bucks, UK). Immunoblotting was carried out with specific antibodies in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20. The primary antibodies were as follows: K16 (Neomarkers, Fremont, CA, USA), NRF2 and KEAP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), c-Jun (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA), and β-actin (Sigma). After washing, the membranes were probed with <span class="blue">horseradish</span> peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and developed by chemiluminescence using the ECL Plus Detection Kit (Amersham Biosciences).<br><br>Plasmids, transfections, and luciferase assays
<span class="yellow">Human</span> K16 promoter regions of varying lengths (pXK-1, 3, 4, 5-1, and 5-2) were provided by Y-N Wang (National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan). These DNA fragments were prepared from HaCaT cells and were ligated into the pXP-1 luciferase vector (Wang and Chang 2003). The p3xARE/Luc vector, harboring three tandem repeats of ARE, was donated by X.L. Chen (Discovery Research, AtheroGenics Inc., Alpharetta, GA, USA) (Chen et al. 2003). The wild-type NRF2 expression vector (WT-NRF2) was a gift from H.S. So (Wonkwang University School of Medicine, Korea) (So et al. 2006). NRF2 cDNA was subcloned into a pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA). For the transfection of reporter plasmids, we seeded HaCaT cells into six-well plates at a density of 80% the previous day. Cells were then transfected with a total of each luciferase reporter construct (2.5 μg) using LipofectAMINE plus (Invitrogen). To control for the efficiency of transfection, Renilla luciferase gene expression was monitored using either the pRL-CMV or pRL-TK vectors (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). For overexpression of WT-NRF2, we normalized the total plasmid concentration using the pcDNA3.1(+) empty vector. Thirty-six hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing either vehicle (PBS) or iAs for 6 hr. After iAs exposure, we harvested cells and analyzed them for luciferase activity using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega).
For the investigation of the role of NRF2 in regulating K16 gene expression, transfection of an NRF2 expression plasmid into HaCaT cells was carried out using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured in 100-mm plates 24 hr before transfection. The expression plasmid WT-NRF2 (15 μg) was then transfected into the cells for 48–60 hr. As a negative control, we used 15 μg of the pcDNA3.1(+) empty vector.<br><br>Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays (EMSA)
We extracted and measured nuclear proteins as described above. Nuclear protein/ DNA complexes were subjected to electrophoresis in nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels containing 2% glycerol in 0.25% Tris-borate/EDTA buffer and transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon transfer membranes (Amersham Biosciences) for detection using the Light-Shift EMSA kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, with minor modifications. We incubated 10-μg aliquots of nuclear extract with the DNA probe in a binding reaction buffer containing 10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.25 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.05% NP-40 detergent, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) for 30 min at room temperature. For supershift assays, 2 μg of either a polyclonal anti-NRF2 or an anti-c-Jun antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added with the nuclear protein for 2 hr at 4°C before the labeled oligonucleotide probe was added. Biotin-labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotides WT-K16ARE (–157/–132, 5′-GGGGAACCTGGAGTCAGCAGT-TAGGA-3′), containing an ARE site (–148/ –140, underlined) in the <span class="yellow">human</span> K16 promoter region, and Mut-K16ARE (5′-GGGGAA-CCTGGAGTCAaaAGTTAGGA-3′, mutated GC box in the ARE) were prepared by Fasmac (Kanagawa, Japan). A consensus ARE probe was purchased from Panomics, Inc. (Redwood City, CA, USA). For competition binding of the K16 ARE-complexes, we used an unlabeled AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide (5′-TATC-GATAAGCTATGAGTCATCCGGG-3′). The binding specificity was confirmed in each case by the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide.<br><br>CHX chase experiment
We investigated the posttranscriptional regulation of both the steady-state levels and half-life of the NRF2 protein by CHX chase analysis. Cells were incubated in serum-free medium in the absence or presence of iAs for 6 hr. The culture medium was then replaced with serum-free medium containing CHX (100 μg/mL). We prepared cell lysates at 0, 10, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min after iAs treatment. Whole-cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies against NRF2.<br><br>Statistics
All the data generated from at least three independent experiments and expressed as the mean ± SD were analyzed by the Student’s t-test. Statistical comparisons were made by logarithmic transformation of the normalized values. We considered p-values < 0.01 to be statistically significant.<br><br>
Results
K16 expression is induced by iAs in HaCaT cells
We wanted to determine whether the K16 mRNA is transcriptionally regulated by iAs, and treated HaCaT cells with this compound for various time periods over a range of doses. After treatment of HaCaT cells with 1–20 μM iAs, the expression of K16 mRNA was increased compared with the control at 6 hr (Figure 1A) but had declined to basal levels at 24 hr. The increase in the K16 protein levels after 6 hr of iAs exposure was just detectable at 10–20 μM, but a dose-dependent increase was more evident at 10 hr (Figure 1B). This enhancement of K16 expression had declined to basal levels at 24 hr.<br><br>Identification of the iAs responsive region in the K16 gene promoter
To investigate the mechanisms underlying the transactivation of the K16 gene by iAs, we first examined the response of the K16 regulatory region to this compound using a luciferase reporter gene assay. The dose-dependent activation of K16 transcription after iAs treatment was observed with a construct containing a 515-bp fragment of the K16 promoter (Figure 2A). To further elucidate the region containing the iAs responsive element, we examined a series of deletions of the 5′-flanking region of K16 gene. The ARE sequence in the pXK-5–1 vector contains an activator protein-1 (AP-1)–like element followed by a GC box. As shown in Figure 2B, an enhancement in the reporter activity levels was observed for the promoter constructs, pXK-1, 3, 4, and 5-1, in response to 20 μM iAs. A decline in reporter activity, however, depended on the number of AP-1–like sites, and the results for the pXK-5-1 construct show also that ARE is activated by iAs. In contrast, no significant activation was observed using a pXK-5-2 construct in response to 20 μM iAs.<br><br>Expression of AP-1 transcriptions factor and c-Jun production following iAs treatment
We examined AP-1 transcription factors c-Jun and c-Fos expression in iAs-treated HaCaT cells by semiquantitative RT-PCR. iAs-induced c-Jun expression was observed during the first 3 hr after treatment (data not shown). An appreciable induction of c-Jun was also confirmed after 6 hr, but this was down-regulated by 24 hr after iAs treatment (Figure 3A). In contrast, the expression of c-Fos was only transiently detectable at 3 hr (data not shown) but was not observed during the 6–24 hr period of this experiment. As shown in Figure 3B, iAs-enhanced c-Jun production can be observed in a dose-dependent manner at 6 hr, but it declines from 10 to 24 hr.<br><br>iAs potently induces the translocation of NRF2 and activates the ARE of the K16 promoter
The results of our reporter assays suggested that iAs stimulates not only the AP-1–like sites but also the ARE site within the K16 gene promoter in HaCaT cells (Figure 3). In addition, several oxidative stress agents and toxic chemicals, including iAs, have been reported to induce the expression of ARE-dependent genes in several cell types (Pi et al. 2003; Sakurai et al. 2005). On the basis of our observations and some recent reports, we thus hypothesized that iAs would have the ability to activate the ARE of the K16 gene promoter directly, resulting in the induction of K16 expression in HaCaT cells. To confirm that the K16 ARE indeed functions as an iAs-responsive transcriptional control element, we performed transient transfections of HaCaT cells with a p3xARE/Luc construct and then subjected these cells to iAs for 6 hr. As shown in Figure 4A, treatment of HaCaT cells with iAs results in a dramatic increase in ARE-driven promoter activity. Likewise, EMSA using a consensus ARE probe show that iAs-induced ARE-binding complexes increase markedly, in a dose-dependent fashion (Figure 4B). These results indicate that iAs has the ability to activate the ARE-driven genes. We performed further EMSA experiments using an ARE probe specific to the K16 proximal promoter region (WT-K16ARE) and found that K16ARE–nuclear protein complexes formation is augmented by iAs in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4C). Moreover, the formation of these complexes is specifically inhibited by the addition of excess unlabeled oligonucleotide competitor (Figure 4B,C), whereas an excess of an unlabeled AP-1 probe competes only marginally for K16ARE binding (Figure 4C).
The NRF2 transcription factor has been shown to bind to AREs upon translocation into the nucleus, resulting in the induction of ARE-mediated genes (Wakabayashi et al. 2004). To examine whether iAs induces and translocates NRF2 into the nucleus in HaCaT cells, we treated these cells with iAs for either 3 or 6 hr. As shown in Figure 4D, a dose-dependent accumulation of NRF2 protein was observed in the nucleus upon treatment with iAs for 6 hr. This was not observed in the parallel experiment performed over the 3-hr time course.
Supershift EMSA analysis using an NRF2 antibody showed that the iAs-induced and iAs-translocated NRF2 protein binds to the WT-K16ARE probe containing the ARE sequence of the K16 proximal promoter region (5′-GGAGTCAGC-3′) that comprises an AP-1–like site and a GC box, whereas the supershift of c-Jun was not observed (Figure 4E). To identify whether the GC box is dispensable for the iAs-stimulated binding activity of NRF2, we next performed EMSA analyses with either WT- or a Mut-K16ARE probe containing an intact AP-1–like element but a mutated GC box. As shown in Figure 4F, the K16ARE–nuclear protein complexes and supershifted bands that were enhanced by iAs treatment were largely abolished by the addition of the Mut-K16ARE probe.<br><br>iAs stabilizes the NRF2 protein
We examined the effects of iAs treatment on the function of KEAP1 in HaCaT cells. Treatment with iAs did not alter the expression levels of KEAP1 mRNA or protein over either a 3 or 6 hr time course (Figure 5A). Next, we examined the effects of iAs on the expression of NRF2 mRNA in HaCaT cells. Exposure to iAs did not significantly alter the steady-state levels of NRF2 mRNA (data not shown). Production of NRF2 protein, however, was observed to increase in both a dose-and time-dependent manner (Figure 4D). To further examine the stabilization of NRF2 protein by iAs, we monitored the decay of basal and iAs-induced NRF2 proteins after inhibition of protein synthesis by CHX (Figure 5B). The results of this analysis revealed that the NRF2 protein levels decrease by approximately 50% within 30 min of treatment with CHX in cells that had not been exposed to iAs. Only trace amounts of NRF2 are then detectable after 60 min of exposure to CHX in these cells. The HaCaT cells were then pretreated with iAs for 6 hr before their exposure to CHX in a similar timecourse experiment. The levels of NRF2 in these iAs-treated cells were again found to decrease by about 50%, but only after 120 min of CHX exposure.<br><br>NRF2 plays a crucial role in the regulation of K16 gene expression in HaCaT cells
To confirm the functional role of NRF2 in the induction of K16 gene expression by iAs, we investigated whether the expression of K16 mRNA is induced by the overexpression of NRF2 (WT-NRF2) in HaCaT cells. We also investigated the expression of the detoxification gene TXN, which is highly induced by a variety of oxidative stimuli through NRF2-mediated ARE transactivation (Kim et al. 2001). The expression of TXN gene in untransfected cells after treatment with iAs was stronger than that of the control cells (Figure 6A). When the cells were transfected with WT-NRF2 and then treated with or without iAs, the expression of TXN mRNA was augmented markedly compared with the empty-vector control. Similarly, the expression of K16 mRNA was also induced in cells transfected with WT-NRF2 in the absence or presence of iAs. We next performed a transient transfection of HaCaT cells with the pXK-5–1 luciferase vector together with the WT-NRF2 vector. The overexpression of NRF2 in increasing concentrations resulted in significant enhancement of the ARE-mediated K16 promoter activation (Figure 6B).<br><br>
Discussion
In the present study, we showed for the first time that iAs induces the transcriptional activation of K16 in the <span class="yellow">human</span> keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT, through the ARE present in its gene promoter. It has been reported previously that treatment with iAs enhances the production and translocation of NRF2 into the nucleus in several cell types. However, until now it has remained uncertain whether the induction of NRF2 by iAs mediates the transcriptional activation of the K16 gene in keratinocytes. In our current experiments, we demonstrated that iAs elongates the half-life of the NRF2 protein, which results in its increased expression levels. Furthermore, this iAs-induced NRF2 protein was shown to bind to the ARE sequences in the promoter region of the K16 gene. Finally, by overexpressing NRF2, we have clarified that its induction is involved in not only the gene expression of the detoxification gene TXN, but also in the upregulation of K16 expression in HaCaT cells through the ARE in the K16 gene promoter. These experiments indicate an important and novel function for NRF2 in the regulation of K16 in keratinocytes and also help to further explain the molecular mechanisms underlying arsenic-mediated epidermal hyperkeratosis.
In our present experiments, the expression levels of K16 mRNA and protein were indeed found to be enhanced by iAs in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1). In addition, luciferase assays of the K16 promoter revealed that iAs enhances its activity in a dose-dependent fashion, which is stimulated by AP-1–like sites and an ARE (Figure 2). The promoter of the <span class="yellow">human</span> K16 gene was recently cloned and sequenced, and several AP-1–like sites were found within the –515-bp region of the gene (Wang and Chang 2003). AP-1 transcription factor can be formed by the dimerization of either Jun or Jun/Fos family members (Eferl and Wagner 2003). In the present study, the increased expression of c-Jun, but not c-Fos was evident in the nuclei of HaCaT cells after iAs treatment (Figure 3). Our findings thus suggest that the activation of c-Jun/AP-1 is one of the essential steps in the regulation of K16 gene expression by iAs exposure in HaCaT cells.
It has been well documented that the ARE core sequence includes an AP-1–like binding site (TGAC/GTCA), followed by a GC box (Rushmore et al. 1991; Xie et al. 1995). We have found in our current analyses that the AP-1–like site within the K16 promoter region from –148 to –140 bp (5′-GGAGTCAGC-3′) resembles a consensus ARE sequence. Recent studies have shown that AREs can be specifically bound by complexes of several basic-leucine zipper transcription factors, including NRF2 (Ishii et al. 2000; Moi et al. 1994). NRF2 heterodimerizes with either AP-1 or small MAF (MAFG, MAFK, and MAFF) proteins (MAF, v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog) and binds to the ARE to induce the transcription of ARE-mediated genes (Motohashi et al. 2002). In the present investigation, EMSA and supershift assays showed that the NRF2 proteins in the nuclei bind to the ARE sequences of K16 promoter region after iAs exposure. iAs-induced c-Jun, however, does not bind to this ARE (Figure 4E). c-Jun may thus act on other AP-1 sites within the K16 promoter region. These results also suggest that other heterodimer partners of NRF2 are involved in the ARE regulation of K16 promoter region underlying iAs-mediated the K16 gene expression. Gel shifts with an K16Mut-ARE probe (harboring a mutation in the ARE GC box) clearly show that the ARE sequence in the K16 promoter, particularly the terminal GC dinucleotide, is essential for mediating iAs-induced K16 transactivation and NRF2 binding (Figure 4F). Several investigations have suggested that the GC nucleotides within the ARE are essential for both the basal and oxidative stress–induced activities of the ARE-related genes, NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone 1 (NQO1) and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) (Wasserman and Fahl 1997; Wild et al. 1998). Our current results are consistent with these earlier studies in showing that the formation of the iAs-responsive NRF2/ARE complexes is reduced by a mutation in the GC box. Collectively, our present observations reveal a new molecular mechanism in which iAs-induced K16 gene expression is also regulated by activation NRF2/ARE pathways.
It has been widely accepted that oxidative stress disrupts sequestration of NRF2 by KEAP1, permits NRF2 translocation to the nucleus, and transactivates the expression of various NRF2-mediated genes (Dinkova-Kostova et al. 2002; McMahon et al. 2003). Our present study showed that iAs elongates the half-life of the NRF2 protein but has no effects upon KEAP1 expression (Figure 5). Other studies have also demonstrated that the production of NRF2 is increased by various inducers via posttranscriptional control (Nguyen et al. 2003; Stewart et al. 2003). Several earlier reports also indicated that either oxidative stress or antioxidant substances stabilize the expression of the NRF2 protein, either by directly modifying the cysteine residues on KEAP1 to disrupt the NRF2/KEAP1 complex (Dinkova-Kostova et al. 2002) or by facilitating the release of NRF2 through the phosphorylation of the NRF2/KEAP1 complex (Bloom and Jaiswal 2003). These findings are largely consistent with our present finding that iAs stabilizes the expression of NRF2 in HaCaT cells by elongating the protein half-life.
Recently, Wakabayashi et al. (2003) demonstrated that NRF2 accumulates in the nucleus at constitutively high levels and produces various cytoprotective genes in embryonic fibroblast- and liver-derived Keap1-null <span class="yellow">mice</span>. Surprisingly, these Keap1-deficient <span class="yellow">mice</span> also show a thicker stratum corneum epidermis, abnormal keratinization, and cornification in the esophagus and forestomach (hyperkeratosis). K6 was found to be strongly expressed in the esophageal epithelium of these <span class="yellow">mice</span>. These results indicate that K6 is also a target gene of NRF2. In addition, the promoter of the K6 gene bears a remarkable sequence similarity to the K16 promoter (Jiang et al. 1993). Therefore, we examined whether K16 gene expression is also regulated by NRF2. In the present study, the gene expression and transactivation of K16 were dramatically induced by transfection with WT-NRF2 via in HaCaT cells, clearly demonstrating that NRF2 acts as a direct transcriptional regulator of the K16 gene (Figure 6). In addition, we also showed that transfection of HaCaT cells with WT-NRF2 induces the expression of detoxification gene TXN (Figure 6A). NRF2 may thus have a major role to play in the development of hyperkeratosis, whereas the expression and induction of NRF2 is implicated in cell protection against a variety of genotoxic and cytotoxic effects. Hence, based on these results and on the findings from studies of Keap1 knockout <span class="yellow">mice</span>, iAs may both cause hyperkeratosis and induce detoxification enzymes via the modification of NRF2. Given that there are both beneficial and adverse effects of NRF2 activity, caution will therefore be needed when using antioxidants for prevention and therapy. Although further investigations are needed, we believe that our findings provide important clues for the design of future therapies for arsenic-mediated hyperkeratosis and for treatments involving the molecular targeting of NRF2.<br><br>Conclusion
Our findings clearly demonstrate that the induction of the K16 gene in <span class="yellow">human</span> keratinocytes by iAs depends on NRF2 activation. Our results thus represent a valuable initial effort to elucidate the relationship between the K16 gene and the NRF2 transcription factor, which may be responsible for hyperkeratosis.<br><br>
<h3>pmcA2636784</h3>Tissue remodeling: a mating-induced differentiation program for the <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> oviduct
Abstract
Background
In both vertebrates and invertebrates, the oviduct is an epithelial tube surrounded by visceral muscles that serves as a conduit for gamete transport between the ovary and uterus. While <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> is a model system for tubular organ development, few studies have addressed the development of the <span class="yellow">fly</span>'s oviduct. Recent studies in <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> have identified mating-responsive genes and proteins whose levels in the oviduct are altered by mating. Since many of these molecules (e.g. Muscle LIM protein 84B, Coracle, Neuroglian) have known roles in the differentiation of muscle and epithelia of other organs, mating may trigger similar differentiation events in the oviduct. This led us to hypothesize that mating mediates the last stages of oviduct differentiation in which organ-specific specializations arise.<br><br>Results
Using electron- and confocal-microscopy we identified tissue-wide post-mating changes in the oviduct including differentiation of cellular junctions, remodeling of extracellular matrix, increased myofibril formation, and increased innervation. Analysis of once- and twice-mated females reveals that some mating-responsive proteins respond only to the first mating, while others respond to both matings.<br><br>Conclusion
We uncovered ultrastructural changes in the mated oviduct that are consistent with the roles that mating-responsive proteins play in muscle and epithelial differentiation elsewhere. This suggests that mating triggers the late differentiation of the oviduct. Furthermore, we suggest that mating-responsive proteins that respond only to the first mating are involved in the final maturation of the oviduct while proteins that remain responsive to later matings are also involved in maintenance and ongoing function of the oviduct. Taken together, our results establish the oviduct as an attractive system to address mechanisms that regulate the late stages of differentiation and maintenance of a tubular organ.<br><br><br><br>Background
Most internal organs, including the vascular and respiratory systems and the gastro-intestinal and urinary-genital tracts are comprised of a single epithelial tube or a network of tubes. Tubular organs serve as conduits for the transport of gases, liquids, or solutes, and serve as barriers between biological compartments. To create tubes with specific flow and barrier properties, the morphology of the tube must be precisely specified during development and modulated by physiology. To accommodate specific physiological roles, tissue-specific programs for differentiation are employed at the last stages of development. While much is known about the molecular and cellular basis of tube formation [1-6], little is known about the mechanisms that regulate the late stages of differentiation in which organ-specific specializations arise.
The conservation of genes and similarity in tubular organ design across taxa make <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> an excellent model for understanding organogenesis in higher animals. In <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span>, the best understood tubular organs from a developmental point of view are the trachea and salivary gland. Studies of these organs reveal a general program for tubular organ development, in which combinatorial expression of global patterning genes specifies positions within the embryo for the subsequent activation of tissue-specific early genes and transcription factors. This program results in the activation of downstream genes involved in terminal differentiation of organ-specific specializations such as the cuticle that lines the tracheal lumen [1,2,4,7-9].
The <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> female reproductive tract is another tubular system, consisting of the uterus and a common oviduct (the main tube) that branches into two lateral oviducts. Regional differences in function are observed along the length of the tract, with egg activation occurring largely at the proximal end, in the lateral oviducts, and fertilization occurring at the distal end, in the uterus [10,11]. Unlike other tubular organs, little is known about the development of the female reproductive tract. However, regional differences in function suggest the presence of region-specific differentiation programs within the female reproductive tract.
In <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span>, mating induces changes in female behavior and physiology via molecules transmitted in the seminal fluid. These changes are rapid and lead to a mated female state which is profoundly different from the unmated female state. While an unmated female lays few eggs and readily accepts the courtship efforts of a male, a mated female exhibits increased egg-laying and actively rejects males [12-19]. Microarray studies of whole <span class="yellow">flies</span> reveal that the changes in egg-laying rate are accompanied by a change in gene expression. Within three hours of mating there is an increase in expression of a small number of genes [20,21]. Rapid changes in gene expression, as well as protein abundance, have also been observed in the female reproductive tract [22,23].
In the upper reproductive tract (lateral and common oviducts, hereafter, oviduct), mating induces an increase in immune related transcripts and down regulates transcription factors involved in cell growth and differentiation. At the protein level mating induces increased abundance of proteins associated with muscle assembly and function and cytoskeletal proteins associated with epithelial morphogenesis [23]. Since many of these mating-responsive proteins act in late differentiation pathways of muscle and epithelia elsewhere (e.g. Bent, Muscle LIM protein 84B(Mlp84B), Neuroglian (Nrg), Coracle (Cora)), we hypothesize that mating triggers similar differentiation in the oviduct. To test our hypothesis we characterized the ultrastructure of oviduct epithelia and muscle, as well as the pattern of innervation before and after mating. We then examined the effect of different mating regimes on oviduct mating-responsive cytoskeletal proteins and on female reproductive output. Our results suggest that active tissue remodeling takes place in the oviduct epithelia and musculature in response to mating. Furthermore, we found a striking increase in innervation of the oviduct after mating.
Our results show that the reproductive tract is an attractive system to address mechanisms that regulate the late stages of tissue differentiation in a tubular organ. Unlike other tubular organs, the last differentiation stage of the oviduct is triggered by an extrinsic cue (mating). This makes it possible to experimentally control the onset of differentiation, with an opportunity to independently examine the effects of mating and age. In addition, it allows us to examine processes essential for reproduction.<br><br>Results
Mating induces changes in oviduct lumen
Our previous molecular profiling showed that mating promotes changes in actin-based cytoskeletal molecules and suggests that mating triggers molecular changes and tissue remodeling in the female reproductive tract that mediate its progression to a mature functional stage [23]. To gain insight into the mechanisms that underlie this progression, we used light and electron microscopy to determine the morphological status of the oviduct in unmated and mated 3-day old females.
In nearly all mated reproductive tracts processed for microscopy (8/9), an egg was located in one of the lateral oviducts, whereas an egg was never observed in the oviduct of unmated reproductive tracts (5/5) (Figure 1). This observation is consistent with previous studies that report increased ovulation and egg-laying at 6 h post-mating [24]. In all unmated reproductive tracts examined, the region between the lateral oviducts and the middle of the common oviduct was either tapered or constricted, whereas this region appeared relaxed in the mated reproductive tract (Figure 1A and 1D). These observations raise the possibility that the lumen is narrow in the unmated oviduct and larger in the mated oviduct. To address this possibility, we collected serial 1 μm longitudinal sections through the reproductive tracts of unmated and mated females and stained these sections with toluidine blue to survey the appearance of the lumen along the entire length of the oviduct (Figure 1B and 1E). Our examination reveals that, in unmated reproductive tracts, the lateral oviduct lumen has an irregular shape, while the common oviduct lumen appears straight. Moreover, in all the unmated reproductive tracts sectioned, we detected patches of darkly stained material in the lumen of the lower common oviduct. In the mated reproductive tract, the lumen of the upper oviduct (defined as the lateral oviduct and upper part of the common oviduct) has an irregular shape, and the lumen of the lower oviduct (defined as the lower part of common oviduct) appears straight. In addition, the lumen of the lower oviduct appears wider in mated than unmated reproductive tracts (Figure 1C and 1F). Interestingly, darkly stained material was not detected in the oviduct lumen of mated females. This observation appears to be consistent with the description made by Mahowald et al. [25], who reported that the oviduct lumen of unmated females is nearly filled with an intima-like matrix and that this matrix is reduced after mating.
Because 3-day-old mated females lay eggs, it is unclear whether the lack of lumenal material and increase in lumen size in mated females occurred before or after the passage of eggs. We suggest that mating directly or indirectly induces morphological changes in the oviduct that facilitate egg passage through the duct. Taken together, our observations lead us to propose that the oviduct lumen is closed and/or obstructed in the unmated reproductive tract, and that mating induces changes in the epithelia and/or muscle that "open" the oviduct lumen.<br><br>Initial formation of cell-cell junctions in oviduct epithelia is mating-independent
To determine whether mating induces specific morphological changes in the oviduct epithelia post-mating, we next examined the ultrastructure of the oviduct epithelia in unmated and mated reproductive tracts. Since molecular profiling demonstrates that proteins associated with cellular junctions such as α- and β-Spectrin (Spec), Cora, and Nrg [23] increase post-mating, we first determined the status of the cellular junctions in the oviduct epithelia of unmated females, and whether these junctions change post-mating. In <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span>, most ectodermally derived epithelia (such as the epidermis and trachea), with a few exceptions, are joined apically by a belt-like adherens junction called the zonal adherens junction (ZA) followed basally by a septate junction (SJ) [26]. Our analysis reveals that the oviduct is lined, along its entire length, by a monolayered epithelium comprised of squamous-type cells. Although region-specific differences in morphology were observed, all oviduct epithelia examined, in both unmated and mated females, are joined along their lateral membranes by an extensive SJ and lack an apical ZA (Figure 2). SJs and ZAs form complete belts that surround the epithelial cell, thus making these junctions easily visible in transverse sections through the epithelium. Because ZAs were not detected in our transverse sections through the oviduct, this implies that ZAs never formed, or developed earlier and were lost (Figure 2D). Interestingly, we did not detect any ultrastructural differences in the SJs at 6 h post-mating, but we did uncover differences in SJ ultrastructure in different regions of the oviduct.
Based on their ultrastructure, two types of SJs, smooth and pleated, can be distinguished in <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> [26]. Smooth SJs are distinguished by the lack of visible septae and the appearance of electron dense material in the intercellular space, while pleated SJs are distinguished by the ladder-like appearance of septae. In the lateral oviducts and upper common oviduct, septa were not detected in the SJ, thus these SJs represent smooth SJs or an immature stage of pleated SJ (Figure 2A, 2A', 2A"). In contrast, a ladder-like arrangement of septae was often visible in the SJs of the lower common oviduct (Figure 2C'), thus these SJs can be classified as pleated. Unlike the smooth-like SJs of the upper oviduct, the pleated SJs of the lower oviduct are followed basally by spot type adherens junction (spot AJs) (Figure 2B, 2B'; additional file 1). Further analysis is necessary to determine if the SJs of the upper and lower oviduct represent different types or different developmental stages. Our findings demonstrate that the initial formation of SJs, as well as spot AJs in the lower oviduct, are mating-independent. This raises an interesting question. Why are SJ proteins such as Cora and Nrg up-regulated post-mating if SJs are formed prior to mating? It is possible that the increased expression of SJ proteins is associated with functional changes in polarized secretion post-mating. Recent studies have shown that SJs play an unexpected role in regulating the apical secretion of specialized extracellular matrix molecules in the trachea [27,28], and that these molecules are important regulators of lumen size.<br><br>Mating modulates apical secretory activity in the oviduct
Given the presence of extensive SJs in the oviduct and the role of SJs in regulating apical secretion of extracellular matrix molecules in other epithelia (e.g. trachea), we asked if mating modulates apical secretion in the oviduct epithelia. Our ultrastructural analysis reveals that different regions of the oviduct display different apical membrane morphology (i.e microvilli or pleats) (see Figures 2 and additional file 2A and 2A), but all epithelia are covered by an electron dense apical extracellular matrix (AECM) and a thin layer of cuticle. We found that mating induces ultrastructural changes in the AECM and cuticle in both the upper and lower oviduct. In the upper oviduct of the unmated female, the AECM varies in thickness along the apical surface (Figure 3A). Some areas have little AECM, while other areas are covered by a distinct layer of AECM (~1–2 μm in thickness; Figure 3B). However, the AECM of mated females is more evenly distributed along the apical surface, (~2 μm in thickness; Figure 3E). Strikingly, the AECM and cuticle of mated females have a ruffled appearance, suggesting that the AECM and cuticle have increased in surface area (Figure 3F). Electron dense granules up to ~1.5 μm in diameter were occasionally observed in both the AECM and cell cytoplasm (Figure 3F). Although further analysis is needed to determine the role of these granules in the oviduct epithelia, it is possible that these granules participate in the secretion and deposition of the AECM. Taken together, our findings suggest that polarized secretion via the AECM, while ongoing in the upper oviduct of the unmated female is enhanced and/or modulated post-mating.
Post-mating changes in AECM ultrastructure are also observed in the lower common oviduct. However, unlike the AECM of the upper oviduct, the AECM of the lower oviduct is well developed prior to mating. In the lower oviduct of the unmated female, the AECM consists of an amorphous electron dense material and is unevenly distributed, forming a thick, bulbous layer above the plasma membrane in some regions (additional file 2). Matrix-like material is also observed in the lumen, but this material is more electron dense than the AECM (additional file 2A and 2A). In the mated female, the AECM is flattened against the plasma membrane and is uniformly distributed along the apical surface (additional file 2B and 2B). Matrix-like material was not observed in the center of the lumen, but small pools of very electron dense material were detected in the spaces between the epithelial folds (additional file 2C and 2C). This may explain why lumenal matrix was not detected at the light microscopic level in the mated female oviduct (see Figure 1E and 1F). Taken together, our observations suggest that the lower common oviduct is a site of active apical secretion in both mated and unmated females, and that matrix secretion, particularly in the lumen, is reduced post-mating. These findings raise the intriguing possibility that the AECM and lumenal matrix function as a plug in the lower oviduct, and that mating induces the breakdown of this plug.<br><br>Mating induces changes in hemi-adherens junctions in upper oviduct
In addition to modulating secretion at the apical membrane, mating induces changes at the basolateral membrane. In many epithelia, one of the last steps of differentiation is the development of a layer of extracellular matrix (ECM) called the basal lamina that covers the apical and/or basal membranes and the concomitant development of hemi-adherens junctions (HAJs). HAJs connect the cell cytoskeleton with the ECM and are formed at virtually all cell surfaces that contact an ECM. HAJs can be distinguished at the ultrastructural level as a patch-like, electron dense undercoat of the plasma membrane that opposes the basal lamina ([26]; Figure 3G, 3H). In the <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> embryo, the HAJs and basal lamina are formed at the same time [26]. Because the basal lamina is established at a time when the majority of extracellular matrix molecules are actively secreted [26,29], this suggests that the formation of HAJs is tightly coordinated with the secretion of the ECM.
One of the most striking post-mating changes observed in the oviduct epithelia was the appearance of numerous HAJs along the basolateral membrane in the upper oviduct (Figure 3). The importance of HAJs, particularly in the upper oviduct, is underscored by the extensive infolding of the basolateral membrane that is observed in both unmated and mated females (Figure 3A and 3E). The infolded membrane gives rise to a highly branched intercellular space that is filled with an ECM (Figure 3C and 3G). This ECM is contiguous with the basal lamina that surrounds the epithelia. Few HAJs were observed in the upper oviduct of the unmated female, and these were largely restricted to the basal membrane, and not observed along the basolateral infolding (Figure 3C). In contrast, numerous HAJs appear along the basolateral infolding post-mating in this region of the oviduct (Figure 3F–3H). In addition, the intercellular space appears wider post-mating (Figure 3C–3D and 3G–3H), suggesting that mating induces increased secretion and/or deposition of the ECM in this cellular compartment and brings the ECM to a threshold concentration that can support the development of HAJs. HAJs were also detected along the basal membrane, but they were not detected along the apical membrane even though this membrane was covered by an ECM. Interestingly, while the basolateral membrane forms very shallow folds in the lower oviduct (see additional file 2), HAJs were observed along this membrane in unmated reproductive tracts (data not shown), thus suggesting that the epithelia is more differentiated in this region of the oviduct, and that the differentiation of the upper and lower oviduct may be under different control.<br><br>Muscle differentiation is enhanced post-mating
While we uncovered post-mating changes in the oviduct epithelia that might facilitate its transition to a high egg-laying state, this transition may also be mediated by changes in oviduct muscle properties and/or activity. The oviduct is lined by circular muscle fibers with supercontractile characteristics [30]. Our previous studies showed that mef2 and mlp84B genes that regulate muscle differentiation, are expressed and increased post-mating in the oviduct, as well as in the sperm storage regions of the reproductive tract [22,23]. This suggests that mating induces muscle differentiation in the reproductive tract. Muscle differentiation is characterized by the assembly of myofilaments into bundles called myofibrils. As muscles differentiate, myofibrils and z-bodies appear simultaneously, and increase in number until the cytoplasm is filled with myofibrils [31]. Like epithelia, one of the last steps of muscle differentiation is the secretion of a basal lamina that surrounds the muscle fiber. To determine if mating induces structural changes in muscles (such as increased myofibrils) we examined the ultrastructure of muscle fibers in the upper and lower parts of the oviduct. Our analysis revealed that, in both unmated and mated reproductive tracts, the muscles of the lower oviduct are highly differentiated as evidenced by the high density of myofibrils, well developed and aligned z-bodies, and secretion of a thick, electron dense basal lamina (Figure 4E and 4F). In contrast, muscle fibers in the lateral oviducts and upper common oviduct appear less differentiated than muscles in the lower common oviduct, as evidenced by the lesser density of myofibrils and z-bodies, and little or no basal lamina (Figure 4A and 4B). Moreover, the muscles of the upper oviduct appear more differentiated in the mated than in unmated reproductive tracts (Figure 4A–4D). Interestingly, we observed neighboring muscle fibers in different states of differentiation in the lateral oviducts in both unmated and mated reproductive tracts, but not elsewhere in the oviduct (Figure 4B). These results suggest that mating enhances the rate of muscle differentiation in the upper oviduct, and that muscle differentiation is delayed in the upper as compared to the lower oviduct. The increased muscle differentiation in the upper oviduct is not dramatic and likely reflects the short post-mating period examined in this study. The delayed differentiation of the upper oviduct muscles resembles the delay in the onset of development between the adult thoracic muscles and abdominal muscles during metamorphosis [32]. Since the ovaries and the other parts of the reproductive tract are known to have different segmental origins [33], we hypothesize that different parts of the oviduct develop at different rates or begin development at different times.<br><br>Increased innervation in the oviduct post-mating
Nerve-muscle interactions play an important role in regulating adult muscle development and refining the final pattern of innervation [34,35]. Given that oviduct muscle differentiation is enhanced post-mating, we predicted that mating either directly or indirectly induces changes in innervation. To address this prediction, we quantified the number of nerve terminals or boutons innervating the lateral oviducts and common oviduct in unmated and mated reproductive tracts. Studies of oviduct innervation in <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> reveal that the <span class="yellow">fly</span>'s oviduct receives aminergic, peptidergic and glutamatergic input [30,36-39]. In both larval and adult <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span>, different types of boutons are formed by neurons that express different neurotransmitters and modulators [40-42]. By similarity to the boutons described at the larval and adult neuromuscular junction, Middleton et al. [30] report that the <span class="yellow">fly</span>'s oviduct is innervated by glutamatergic type I boutons and tyraminergic/octopaminergic type II boutons. Rodgriguez-Valentin et al. [43] further report that the oviduct type II boutons co-express octopamine and glutamate. The neurons that give rise to the type I innervation have not been identified. However, it is well established that type II innervation arises from octopaminergic neurons located in the abdominal ganglion [30,43]. In addition, it has been shown that some or all of these neurons express a GAL4 insertion line for the bullwinkle (bwk) gene [43]. Bwk encodes a HMG-box containing putative transcription factor [44]. To determine if mating induces any changes in the number of type I and II boutons innervating the oviduct muscles, we used the pan-neural marker, anti-HRP to label all oviduct boutons in unmated and mated females. To distinguish between type I and II boutons we used an antibody against the Disc Large (DLG) protein [45]. Type I boutons were identified by their DLG postsynaptic staining and large size (> 8 μm in diameter) (Figure 4G), while type II boutons were distinguished by their absence of DLG staining and smaller size (< 2 μm) (Figure 4H). We find that type I and II boutons innervate the lateral oviducts and common oviduct, and that the type I innervation is restricted to a few axons that run parallel to the length of the oviduct, while the type II innervation is more widespread. We quantified the number of boutons in the lateral oviducts and common oviduct and observed a 74% increase in bouton number in the lateral oviduct and a 66% increase in the common oviduct post-mating (Figure 4I). More over, we observed no significant change in the number of type I boutons in the lateral oviduct and common oviduct. However, we detected a 1.5-fold increase in the number of type II boutons in the lateral oviduct and a 1.8-fold increase in type II innervation in the common oviduct. Dramatic increases in bouton growth are also observed during development. For example, a ten-fold increase in bouton number is observed at the neuromuscular junction during the larval period [46]. To determine if the increase in type II innervation was specific to mating or reflected normal growth in 3 day-old females, we quantified type I and II innervation in the oviducts of 5 day-old unmated females. We found no significant difference in type I and II innervation in unmated 3 day-old and 5-day-old females, indicating that mating, either directly or indirectly, induces a dramatic increase in type II innervation (Figure 4I). To determine if the post-mating increase in innervation is unique to the oviduct, we asked if mating induces a global change in innervation. We quantified bouton number in the adult ventral midline muscles of the 5th abdominal segment. These muscles are innervated by boutons that increase in number during metamorphosis [47]. No significant difference in bouton number was detected at these muscles in unmated and mated females (additional file 3). Though further analysis is needed, this suggests that the post-mating increase in innervation is oviduct-specific. Because the type II boutons are octopaminergic, the increased type II innervation may result in increased octopamine (OA) release in the oviduct. In support of this possibility, we have preliminary evidence that OA is released in the oviduct post-mating (Heifetz and Wolfner, in preparation). Studies in locust and <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> demonstrate that OA inhibits oviduct contraction, while glutamate activates oviduct contraction [30,43,48]. In <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span>, electrical stimulation of the posterior abdominal nerve gives rise to a series of muscle contractions in the oviduct followed by a period of muscle fatigue or relaxation [43]. This pattern of muscle contraction and relaxation may facilitate the proper movement of the egg through the oviduct. In their study of bwk expressing neurons that innervate the oviduct, Rodriguez-Valentin et al. [43] show that OA and glutamate interact to produce the pattern of oviduct contraction and relaxation described above. It is therefore possible that the post-mating increase in type II innervation in the oviduct plays an important role in the increased rate of ovulation and egg-laying observed post-mating.<br><br>Female mating history affects the enrichment of cytosekeletal proteins in the oviduct
To gain insights into the role of cytoskeletal protein enrichment ([23]; additional file 4) in mediating the morphological changes detected in this study, we examined the effect of different mating regimes on cytoskeletal protein abundance. We focused on a subset of mating-responsive cytoskeletal proteins with well established roles in the differentiation of muscle and epithelia. These include: (i) Mlp84B which regulates the late differentiation pathway of muscle [49]; (ii) Cora and Nrg which are required for the formation of septate junctions in epithelia [50], and (iii) Hu-li tai shao (Hts), also known as adducin-like protein, which functions in assembly of the cytoskeletal network. Na+ pump α subunit (ATPα), another protein associated with septate junctions in epithelia, is not a mating-responsive protein and was used as a control. Using western blots, we first determined the abundance of the cytoskeletal proteins in oviducts of 3-day-old unmated and mated females at 6 hrs post-mating. We confirmed the proteomic results of Kalpenikov et al. [23] and found that mating increases the abundance of all proteins, except ATPα in mated oviducts relative to their abundance in unmated oviducts (Figure 5A).
To determine whether the increased abundance of mating-responsive proteins persists for longer times post-mating, we examined oviducts of 10-day-old females that mated once at 3 days of age, and calculated the abundance of the mating-responsive proteins relative to their level in oviducts of 3-day-old unmated females. We found no change or a slight increase in the relative abundance of all cytoskeletal proteins except Mlp84B at 7 days post-mating (Figure 5A). Strikingly, the level of Mlp84B declines by 7 days post-mating to the level observed prior to mating. Thus Mlp84B levels rise and fall after mating, while the epithelial-related proteins rapidly rise and are maintained at a high level after mating. This raises the possibility that a second mating might trigger an increase in Mlp84B protein expression as observed in 3-day-old females at 6 h post-mating. To test this possibility, females were mated twice (once at day 3, and once on day 10 of age), and their oviducts were examined at 6 hrs after the second mating. We calculated the abundance of the cytoskeletal proteins in the twice mated oviducts relative to their abundance in oviducts of 3-day-old unmated females. Our results show that a second mating has little or no effect on Mlp84B abundance. Thus, Mlp84B may represent a class of mating-responsive proteins that is only needed after the first mating. Interestingly, the effect of the second mating on the epithelial-related mating-responsive proteins appears to be different for each protein. While Cora levels drop to the level observed in 3-day-old unmated females, Nrg and Hts are maintained at a high level.
To determine if the changes in cytoskeletal protein abundance are mating-dependent we measured their abundance in the oviducts of unmated 5- and 10-day-old females. We calculated their abundance relative to their level in oviducts of unmated 3-day-old females (Figure 5B). We rationalized that if the change in cytoskeletal protein abundance is mating-dependent we will not see similar changes in unmated females. We observed a slow increase in the relative abundance of all mating-responsive proteins with time post-eclosion (Figure 5B). Because unmated females lay more eggs as they age (see additional file 5C) one possible interpretation of the increased level of cytoskeletal proteins in unmated females is that these proteins are associated with an intrinsic program for oviduct maturation and that mating accelerates this process to maximize egg-laying efficacy. Alternatively, it is possible that the slow increase in protein abundance observed in unmated females is due to the passage of eggs through the oviduct.
Taken together, our results suggest that mating is essential to fine-tune the levels of the mating-responsive proteins examined in this study. Because the changes in cytoskeletal protein abundance are different in unmated and mated females, this suggests that the post-mating changes are mating-dependent. Furthermore, we suggest that these post-mating changes are linked to changes in oviduct function.<br><br>Early or prior mating increases fecundity
In <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span>, female fecundity decreases with age [51-54]. It has been proposed that this decrease is due, in part, to the loss of germline and somatic stem cells [55]. Since the expression of the oviduct cytoskeletal proteins examined in this study change with age and mating experience, the state of the oviduct may also play a role in fecundity. To separate the effects of age and mating, we measured the fecundity of females that mated twice, first at 3 days post-eclosion and again at 10 days, and compared that to the fecundity of females that mated once at 3 days and females that mated once at 10 days. Fecundity was measured as the number of eggs laid per day per female during the first three days after mating. Once-mated 3-day-old females laid nearly twice as many eggs as once-mated 10-day-old females during the three days examined (24.5 ± 0.7 versus 13.3 ± 0.9, p < 0.0001). Twice-mated 10-day-old females also laid about 50% more eggs than once-mated females of the same age (19.3 ± 0.9 versus 13.3 ± 0.9, p < 0. 0001), but about 20% fewer than laid by once-mated 3-day-old females during the three days examined (19.3 ± 0.9 versus 24.5 ± 0.7, p < 0.0001) (Figure 6A, see also additional file 5A and 5B). Thus, the difference in fecundity between once-mated 10-day-old and once-mated 3-day-old females is not a result of age alone. Rather the main determinant of fecundity at 10 days is whether there had been a prior mating at 3 days. We also calculated the fertility (number of adults eclosed) of once- and twice-mated females. Once-mated 3-day-old females are more fertile than once-mated 10-day-old females (69.5 ± 1.6% versus 56.1 ± 3.0%, p < 0.0001) and slightly more fertile than twice-mated 10-day-old females (69.5 ± 1.6% versus 62.7 ± 2.4%, p < 0.015) (Figure 6B, see also additional file 5D). Because there is no significant difference in fertility between once-mated and twice-mated 10-day-old females, this suggests that (1) a prior mating has no significant effect on the fertility of 10-day-old mated females and (2) fertility decreases with age. One intriguing interpretation of these results is that an early mating increases fecundity which partially compensates for the age-related decrease in fertility. Thus, cytoskeletal mating-responsive protein changes may be associated with structural changes in the oviduct that result in increased fecundity. This may counteract the effects of decreased fertility on the reproductive output.<br><br>
Discussion
Despite the use of <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> as a model system for organ-level biology and the emerging parallels between mammalian and <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> reproductive biology [56], this is the first integrative tissue-wide study of post-mating changes in the <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> oviduct. Our results provide several lines of evidence at the molecular, morphological and physiological levels suggesting that mating induces tissue-wide differentiation in the oviduct. Moreover, we identify ultrastructural changes in the mated oviduct that are consistent with the roles that some of the mating-responsive proteins examined in this study (e.g. Mlp84B, Cora, Nrg) are reported to play in muscle and epithelial differentiation elsewhere. For example, the increased abundance of Mlp84B, a major regulator of the late differentiation pathway of muscle [49] is consistent with the increased muscle differentiation in the upper oviduct post-mating (Figure 4A–4F). Similarly, the increased abundance of Cora and Nrg, molecules that are essential for SJ development and function [50] is consistent with the observation that SJs in the upper oviduct are immature and/or that mating induces changes in the apical extracellular matrix whose secretion may be regulated, in part, by SJs as occurs in the trachea [27,28]. Other post-mating changes that indicate that mating induces tissue-wide differentiation include increased HAJs along the basolateral membrane and increased innervation.
Analysis of protein abundance following different mating regimes (unmated, once-mated, twice-mated) gave us further insights into the possible roles that mating-responsive proteins play in the oviduct. For example, Mlp84B is only responsive to the first mating, while the epithelial proteins examined (Cora, Nrg and Hts) are responsive to the first and second mating. Furthermore, the response to the second mating is different from the response to the first mating. Taken together, these results suggest that Mlp84B is required for the final maturation of the oviduct, while the epithelial proteins examined are required for both the maturation and maintenance of the oviduct at a high functional state. Moreover, the post-mating pattern of Mlp84B supports the idea that the first mating induces the final maturation of the oviduct. The rise and fall of Mlp84B abundance after the first mating (Figure 5) parallels the expression pattern of Mlp84B during development where peaks in Mlp84B transcription occur during periods of embryogenesis and metamorphosis when muscle is differentiating [49].
Using different mating regimes we tested whether the first/early mating is essential for maintenance of high reproductive output in the second mating. Our results suggest that mating at an early age is essential to achieve maximum reproductive output (i.e. high fecundity and fertility). Since the first mating increases reproductive output (evidence from our mating regime experiments), it is likely that the ultrastructural changes detected in mated 3-day-old females lead to a highly functional oviduct.
We suggest that the final maturation of the oviduct includes a mating-dependent stage. We propose that during the first few days post-eclosion, the oviduct undergoes the first phase of differentiation, after which the oviduct is developmentally poised for a rapid response to an extrinsic cue (mating). Mating then triggers the second phase of maturation (tissue remodeling and modulation) which is essential for proper oviduct function (Figure 7). We further propose that the second phase of maturation consists of processes that are mating-independent and -dependent, and that both of these pathways are essential to produce a functional oviduct. For example, initial formation of SJs occurs prior to mating (mating-independent) while the increased apical secretion and development of HAJs are mating-dependent. The oviduct musculature is an example where both mating-independent and -dependent processes play a role. Muscles are highly differentiated in the lower oviduct prior to mating, while muscle differentiation is ongoing in the upper oviduct and increases after mating. Although the onset of muscle differentiation in both regions is mating-independent, the further differentiation of muscle in the upper oviduct is mating-dependent. Another possible interpretation of the role of mating on oviduct maturation is that mating accelerates and synchronizes processes that are essential for the functional maturation of the oviduct. It will therefore be interesting to examine the oviducts of older females to determine the status of oviduct maturation.
What is the benefit of mating-induced differentiation of the oviduct tissues? Unmated females are capable of laying eggs, albeit at a reduced rate as compared to mated females of the same age. One possible interpretation is that reproduction is energetically costly, thus delaying oviduct maturation until sperm is available is advantageous to the female. This may reflect the evolution of a mechanism to optimize reproductive capacity in early adulthood in short-lived animals.
In summary, we have identified events at the cellular, molecular and physiological levels that are part of an efficient and specific program for reproduction. <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> affords us the opportunity to uncover the signaling pathways that coordinate these events to produce a physiologically functional organ.<br><br>Methods
Flies
Wild-type Canton-S <span class="yellow">flies</span> were used for the fecundity/fertility experiments and confocal analysis. Wild-type Canton-S5 [57] <span class="yellow">flies</span> were used for electron microscopy. All <span class="yellow">flies</span> were kept in a 12 hrs light/dark cycle at 23 ± 2°C. Upon eclosion, females and males were collected on ice and held separately until 3 (females and males) or 10 (females) days of age.<br><br>Sample preparation
For all assays (unless described differently) unmated females were placed with 3-day-old unmated males and observed until mating initiated. At the end of mating, females were aspirated into fresh vials and held for 6 hrs. At 6 hrs after the start of mating, females were placed on ice for dissection. Previous molecular studies indicate changes in protein abundance at 3 hrs post-mating. We hypothesize that these molecular changes will translate into morphological changes in the next few hours. We chose to analyze the morphology of mated females at 6 h post-mating as opposed to later times post-mating because the changes observed at later times may be due, in part, to the high rate of eggs passing through the oviduct.<br><br>Electron microscopy
Reproductive tracts were dissected in Schneider's <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> medium (Sigma) on ice and processed for electron microscopy as described in [42]. Tracts were flat-embedded between two sheets of Aclar (Electron Microscopy Sciences), which allowed us to image the entire tract at the light microscopic level prior to sectioning. Sections were cut on a Reichart Ultracut microtome. One-μm thick sections were stained with 1% toluidine blue, and viewed with a Zeiss Axoplan microscope. Ultrathin sections (~100 nm) were mounted on formvar grids, stained with lead citrate, and viewed with a Philips/FEI Morgagni 268 TEM at 80 kV. Our analysis is based on 4 unmated samples and 3 mated samples. Two unmated samples were cut in the longitudinal plane and two additional unmated samples were cut in the transverse plane, while one mated sample was cut in the longitudinal plane and two additional mated samples were cut in the transverse plane. For longitudinal sections, the entire tract was re-embedded and cut. For samples cut in the transverse plane, the flat-embedded reproductive tract was divided into three regions: (1) lateral oviducts and upper common oviducts, (2) middle common oviduct, and (3) lower common oviduct. Each region was re-embedded and sectioned. It is beyond the scope of this paper to describe all three regions, and our analysis focuses on the uppermost and lowermost regions.<br><br>Immunocytochemistry
Reproductive tracts were dissected in Yamamoto's Ringer (10 mM MOPS; 80 mM NaCl; 10 mM KCL; 0.2 mM MgCl2; 0.1 mM CaCl2) with 5% (w/v) sucrose on ice, fixed in 4% paraphormaldehyde in PBS (phosphate-buffered saline; 0.85% NaCl, 1.4 mM KH2 PO4, 8 mM Na2 HPO4, pH 7.4) for 45 min and then washed in PBS. The reproductive tracts were then incubated in blocking solution (0.5% Triton x-100, 3% NGS, 0.1% BSA) for 2 hrs at room temperature. The following primary antibodies, reagents, and dilutions were used: Cy3-conjugated <span class="yellow">goat</span> anti-HRP, 1:200 (Jackson Immunochemicals, West Grove, PA); <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-Disc Large (DLG), 1:1000 (Developmental Hybridoma Bank), Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin, 1:200 (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes, Scotland). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Flour 488-conjugated <span class="yellow">Goat</span> anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span>, 1:200 and Alexa Flour 546-conjugated <span class="yellow">Goat</span> anti-<span class="yellow">rabbit</span>, 1:200 (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes, Scotland). Reproductive tracts were incubated with the different primary antibodies (diluted in PBS + 0.2% Triton x-100) for 2 hr at room temperature, washed with PBST, incubated with secondary antibodies for 2 hrs at room temperature and washed with PBS. Reproductive tracts of the different treatments were mounted with Antifade media [58] on a multi-well glass slide (Hendley-Essex, UK). For each treatment (unmated, mated) and antibody/reagent (HRP, DLG, phalloidin) a minimum of ten reproductive tracts from at least two independent biological replicates were prepared.<br><br>Confocal microscopy
Reproductive tracts were viewed with a Zeiss 510 laser scanning confocal microscope using 20× and 60× objective with additional zooming. Optical sections from different focal plans of each reproductive tract region (lateral oviducts, common oviduct, uterus) were collected and projected as a reconstructed three-dimensional image using LSM image browser (version 3,5,0,376) software. Image collections were identical for each of the different reproductive tract regions analyzed.<br><br>Quantitation of bouton number
To quantify the number of boutons in the lateral and common oviducts we used ImageJ software (1.37b, National Institutes of Health) to analyze confocal images of anti-HRP and anti-DLG labeled boutons in the oviduct. The number of boutons per unit area was quantified with the Particle Analysis Tool. Briefly, to differentiate between the boutons, the particle analysis tool requires the image to be a "binary" image (i.e., black or white), thus we first converted the images to gray scale. We then set a "threshold" range so that pixels in the image whose value lies in this range are converted to black; pixels with values outside this range are converted to white. We next defined a region of interest (ROI) within the oviduct to count particles (i.e. count boutons). This ROI was saved and served to measure the number of boutons per unit area in each treatment. For each oviduct we counted the number of anti-HRP and anti-DLG labeled boutons in two ROIs within the lateral oviducts and two ROIs in the common oviduct. One-way ANOVA (SPSS 15.0) was used to measure the difference in bouton number per unit area in different regions of the oviducts, in both unmated and mated females.<br><br>Quantitation of cytoskeleton proteins
Sample preparation
To evaluate the effect of mating on the abundance of the cytoskeleton proteins tested, females were: (i) aged for 3 days, mated with 3-day-old unmated males and their oviducts were dissected after 6 hrs post-mating (Once3); (ii) aged for 3 days, mated with 3-day-old unmated males and their oviducts were dissected after 7 days (Once3 day10); (iii) aged for 3 days, mated first with 3-day-old unmated males and held singly for 7 days. At 10 days of age, female were mated again with 3-day-old unmated males. Oviducts were dissected at 6 hrs post-second mating (Twice3&10). We also examined 5-day-old and 10-day-old unmated females (UM5, UM10 respectively).<br><br>SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting
For each mating regime, sixty oviducts were pooled and 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added as described in [59]. Samples were boiled, and then frozen at -20°C until loading. SDS-PAGE was performed on 12% polyacrylamide gels and western blotted as in [60]. Proteins were cross-linked to the filter. The following primary antibodies and dilutions were used: <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-Neuroglian (kindly provided by M. Hortsch) 1:250; <span class="yellow">Guinea pig</span> anti-Coracle (kindly provided by R.G. Fehon) 1:2500; <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-Mlp84B (kindly provided by M. Beckerle) 1:1000; <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-hts (1B1, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, DSHB) 1:75; <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-Na, K-ATPase (α5, DSHB) 1:100. Secondary antibodies included: anti-<span class="yellow">Guinea pig</span> IgG (peroxidase conjugated), anti-<span class="yellow">Rabbit</span> IgG and anti-<span class="yellow">Mouse</span> IgG (developed in <span class="yellow">goat</span>, Sigma, Israel) 1:10,000. Proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Piscataway, NJ).<br><br>Analysis
The developed film was scanned and the signal intensity (protein abundance) of each band was determined using ImageJ software (1.37d, National Institutes of Health). We evaluated protein abundance by measuring the mean gray value of a specific band and the background. The mean gray value of the background was then subtracted from that of the measured band. Relative protein abundance in mated oviduct vs. 3-day-old unmated oviduct was then calculated. Four independent biological replicates were prepared for each mating status. The reported abundance (see Figure 5) is the relative ratio (mated/unmated or unmated/unmated) of at least three replicates that showed the same trend.<br><br>
Examination of female reproductive output
Mating regimes
To evaluate the effect of mating on reproductive output females were treated as follows: (i) aged for 3 days and mated with 3-day-old unmated males (Once3); (ii) aged for 10 days and mated with 3-day-old unmated males (Once10); (iii) aged for 3 days, mated first with 3-day-old unmated males, held for 7 days and mated again with 3-day-old unmated males (Twice3&10). In all cases male and female pairs were observed to record mating initiation and termination.<br><br>Analysis
Following mating, females were aspirated into fresh vials, held singly and allowed to lay eggs for 6 hrs, then transferred daily (each 24 hrs) to fresh vials. The number of eggs laid and the number of eclosed adults were counted from vials created at 6 hrs, 1, 2 and 3 days post-mating. To ascertain the baseline of female egg-laying, we also included in our experiment unmated females that were kept in the same conditions as mated females. The number of eggs laid by unmated females was counted from vials created at 6 hrs, 1, 2 and 3 days after placing the females in the holding vials. In addition, we also recorded the pattern of unmated female egg-laying for 10 days.
To determine the effect of different mating regimes on female reproductive output (i.e. fecundity and fertility), we used One-way ANOVA (SPSS 15.0).<br><br><br><br>Abbreviations

<h3>pmcA2562362</h3>Host immunity in the protective response to vaccination with heat-killed <span class="yellow">Burkholderia mallei</span>
Abstract
Background
We performed initial cell, cytokine and complement depletion studies to investigate the possible role of these effectors in response to vaccination with heat-killed <span class="yellow">Burkholderia mallei</span> in a susceptible BALB/c <span class="yellow">mouse</span> model of infection.<br><br>Results
While protection with heat-killed bacilli did not result in sterilizing immunity, limited protection was afforded against an otherwise lethal infection and provided insight into potential host protective mechanisms. Our results demonstrated that <span class="yellow">mice</span> depleted of either B cells, TNF-α or IFN-γ exhibited decreased survival rates, indicating a role for these effectors in obtaining partial protection from a lethal challenge by the intraperitoneal route. Additionally, complement depletion had no effect on immunoglobulin production when compared to non-complement depleted controls infected intranasally.<br><br>Conclusion
The data provide a basis for future studies of protection via vaccination using either subunit or whole-organism vaccine preparations from lethal infection in the experimental BALB/c <span class="yellow">mouse</span> model. The results of this study demonstrate participation of B220+ cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α in protection following HK vaccination.<br><br><br><br>Background
<span class="yellow">Burkholderia mallei</span>, the etiologic agent of glanders, is a gram-negative, capsulated, non-motile, facultative intracelluar bacterium. Most known members of the Burkholderiaceae are resident in the soil; however, <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> is thought to be an obligate mammalian pathogen. <span class="yellow">Horses</span> are highly susceptible to infection and considered the natural reservoir for infection, although <span class="yellow">mules</span> and <span class="yellow">donkeys</span> are also susceptible [1]. Clinically, glanders in solipeds can present as either a chronic (<span class="yellow">horses</span>) or acute (<span class="yellow">mules</span> and <span class="yellow">donkeys</span>) form. Naturally acquired <span class="yellow">human</span> infection with <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span>, although not seen in the United States since 1945, has occurred rarely and sporadically among laboratory workers and those in direct contact with infected animals [2]. However, glanders is endemic among domestic animals in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Central and South America. The course of infection is dependent on the route of exposure. Direct contact with the skin can lead to a systemic infection. Inhalation of aerosol or dust containing <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> can lead to septicemic, pulmonary, or chronic infections of the muscle, liver and spleen. The disease has a 95% case fatality rate for untreated septicemic infections and a 50% case fatality rate in antibiotic-treated individuals [3].
There is no <span class="yellow">human</span> or animal vaccine available for glanders, and development of a partial or fully protective adaptive host response to the organism has not been well-defined. Previous studies with <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> and the host response have shown that a mixed immune response consisting of both Th1 and Th2-associated cytokines with a predominant IgG1 subclass does not correlate with protection [4]. Additional studies with passive transfer of monoclonal antibodies specific for <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> have correlated with early protection from infection [5]. Recent studies have also shown the Th1 cytokine IL-12 to mediate partial protection to non-viable <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span>-vaccinated <span class="yellow">mice</span> [6]. Thus, full correlates of protection mediated by the adaptive immune system against <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> remain to be fully elucidated.
In this series of studies, we sought to address the impact of depletion of the major effector lymphoid cell populations (B220+ B cells, CD4+ or CD8+ T cells) and key pro-inflammatory/Type 1 cytokines (IFN-γ or TNF-α) on survival in BALB/c <span class="yellow">mice</span> vaccinated with heat killed (HK) bacilli followed by an intraperitoneal (i.p.) challenge with live organism. In addition, studies investigating the effect of complement on opsonization of organism and antibody production were assessed. Heat killed bacteria were used as a model of vaccination to allow evaluation of <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> specific immune responses. The results of this study demonstrate participation of B220+ cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α in protection following HK vaccination.<br><br>Results
Heat-killed <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> vaccination mediates partial protection from lethal challenge
To begin to address this issue in an animal model of acute infection, we established that immunologically naive BALB/c <span class="yellow">mice</span> challenged i.p. with 2 × 107 CFU resulted in death by day 4–6, while i.p. immunization with 1 × 105 heat killed (HK) bacteria provided partial protection against a subsequent challenge. Two independent experiments resulted in similar findings of 40% survival for HK-vaccinated <span class="yellow">mice</span> with a mean survival time (MST) of 8 days versus 4 days in naïve <span class="yellow">mice</span> (Fig. 1). The administration of vaccines for <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> during an outbreak would mandate relatively rapid onset of protection for <span class="yellow">human</span> or veterinary use. Based on non-routine use and vaccine implementation in the course of an outbreak, a 14 day window was chosen for assessment of protection. Our results indicate that HK vaccination can afford partial protection to an otherwise lethal challenge of <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> by the i.p. route.<br><br>Effects of cell depletion on HK-vaccinated survival
To dissect the cellular basis for protection mediated by HK vaccination, 13 days after immunization with HK bacteria (day -1), and at day of challenge, <span class="yellow">mice</span> were dosed with antibodies to deplete CD4+, CD8+ or B220+ cells. Antibody depletion of CD4+, CD8+, or B220+ cells in these <span class="yellow">mice</span> was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis with depletion efficiencies for CD4, CD8, and B220 populations at 99.7%, 96%, and 95%, respectively, relative to <span class="yellow">mice</span> treated with isotype control monoclonal antibodies (data not shown). Our results demonstrated decreased survival rates in B220 (p = 0.3418), CD4+ (p = 0.5417) and CD8+ (p = 0.4684) antibody depleted <span class="yellow">mice</span>, compared to isotype control antibody, a finding that indicated a possible role for vaccine induced antibody production. When challenged with 2 × 107 CFU/<span class="yellow">mouse</span> by the i.p. route, loss of T cells resulted in reduced survival (50%) relative to the non-specific isotype control (Fig. 2). In contrast to the loss of T cells, depletion of B220+ cells resulted in 100% mortality relative to the non-specific isotype control (Fig. 2). To further evaluate the necessity of these effector cells in providing protection following HK vaccination, relatively resistant C57BL/6 <span class="yellow">mice</span>, deficient in mature B-cells (μMT), CD4 T-cells (CD4-/-) or CD8 T-cells (CD8-/-) were subjected to an identical HK vaccination and challenge regimen. Mature, B-cell-deficient <span class="yellow">mice</span> demonstrated a 50% decreased survival (p = 0.0888) compared to the wild-type <span class="yellow">mice</span> with an MST of 35.5 days (Fig. 3). CD4-/- and CD8-/- <span class="yellow">mice</span> exhibited a 60% (p = 0.1343) and 0% reduced survival, respectively (Fig. 3).<br><br>Effects of cytokine depletion on HK vaccination
Similar studies were performed to determine the role of IFN-γ or TNF-α in acute infection in BALB/c <span class="yellow">mice</span> immunized with HK bacteria. Six hours before challenge, <span class="yellow">mice</span> were dosed with antibodies that neutralize IFN-γ or TNF-α. Individual depletion of either TNF-α (p = 0.0145) or IFN-γ (p = 0.0446) resulted in 100% mortality with an MST of 3 and 2 days, respectively, compared to the HK-vaccinated isotype control <span class="yellow">mice</span> (Fig. 4). In contrast, 40% of HK-vaccinated, isotype control <span class="yellow">mice</span> survived to at least 12 days post-challenge (Fig 4). To further evaluate the host TNF-α response during an established <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> chronic infection, we infected 12 BALB/c <span class="yellow">mice</span> by the i.p. route with 1 × 106 CFU <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span>. One animal was terminally ill on day 37 post-infection. On day 42 post-infection, the remaining 11 <span class="yellow">mice</span> were dosed with either anti-TNF-α (n = 6), or control mAb (AFRC Mac 49) (n = 5). No further deaths were observed in the control mAb-treated <span class="yellow">mice</span>. Rapid mortality was observed in the anti-TNF-α-treated group, with all <span class="yellow">mice</span> dying within 7 days of treatment (p = 0.0023) relative to the isotype-treated controls (Fig. 5).<br><br>J774A.1 uptake of serum treated <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span>
Complement mediated uptake assays were performed to evaluate opsonization. Results indicated enhanced bacterial uptake in J774A.1 phagocytes inoculated with serum treated <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> (p = .0082), compared to <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> alone, while heat-inactivated serum produced uptake percentages similar to those prior to serum addition (Fig. 6). Taken together, these results imply an active role for complement components in the uptake of organism by macrophages.<br><br>Immunoglobulin production in HK vaccinated BALB/c <span class="yellow">mice</span>
We further characterized the ability of HK vaccination to induce a predominant IgG isotype by determining IgG2a/IgG1 ratios in i.p. and i.n. vaccinated BALB/c <span class="yellow">mice</span>. Pre (day 14 post vaccination) and post (day 2 post infection) exposure serum samples were obtained and evaluated for IgG isotype concentrations (Table 1). No appreciable differences in IgG pre-exposure levels were seen when comparing i.n. to i.p. vaccination. In addition, cobra venom factor-treated animals showed no significant differences to non-cobra venom factor-treated animals in IgG pre-exposure (challenge) levels. Conversely, isotype switching in the cobra venom factor treated animals was enhanced in post-exposure serum IgG2a (Table 1).<br><br>
Discussion
Recent studies have shown a key role in protection from lethal challenge for IFN-γ in non-vaccinated <span class="yellow">mice</span> from either NK and/or NKT cells following experimental exposure to <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> and <span class="yellow">B. pseudomallei</span> [7,8]. A similar protective role in the innate response to infection has been demonstrated for TNF-α in <span class="yellow">B. pseudomallei</span> infection [8]. The studies presented here are consistent with the essential role of these factors in the relative levels of protection conferred by vaccination with heat-killed <span class="yellow">B. pseudomallei</span> and would appear to be viable early markers for protection from lethal acute infection [9]. Currently, there are no fully protective vaccines against <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> or <span class="yellow">B. pseudomallei</span> in a <span class="yellow">murine</span> model, particularly for the sensitive BALB/c versus C57BL6 models. Previous studies have also demonstrated that both the humoral and cell-mediated arms are essential for protection from <span class="yellow">B. pseudomallei</span> infection [10]. Thus, loss or reduction of TNF-α and IFN-γ levels result in significantly reduced survival rates, substantiating previous reports of the role of these factors in protection against <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> [7]. Moreover, we demonstrate a role for sustained TNF-α production in the maintenance of host survival throughout the course of <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> infection. <span class="yellow">Mice</span> with an established <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> chronic infection rapidly lost the ability to control the growth of the bacillus upon neutralization of TNF-α. This would suggest a potential role for TNF-α in the maintenance of productive granulomas which may limit the spread of bacteria in chronically infected hosts, or, alternatively, in direct or indirect microbicidal or bacteriostatic activities at the sites of infection. Additional studies are underway to determine more precisely the role of TNF-α in host protection to <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span>.
Multiple innate and adaptive cell types may contribute to the production of IFN-γ in response to infection with <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> following vaccination. Our results with individual depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells suggests that both cell types may compensate for the functional loss of the other effector cell type in the production of this key cytokine. The effector role for IFN-γ in mediating protection against <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> may include both immunoregulatory and non-regulatory functions. Regardless, the requirement of IFN-γ, as demonstrated by administration of neutralizing antibody prior to infection, indicates that stimulation of IFN-γ response is a desirable goal for a <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> vaccine.
Similarly, B220-positive cells appear to play a role in protection following vaccination with heat-killed <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span>. Interestingly, this protective immunity, occurring in other intracellular pathogens, is not exclusively dependent on B cells [11]. Passive protection has been demonstrated against acute Burkholderia infection by monoclonal antibodies [5,12]. Protection against <span class="yellow">B. pseudomallei</span> infection by anti-LPS, capsular polysaccharide and proteins has been short-lived, suggesting that antibody production offers limited protection in the initial stages of infection by an as-yet-undefined mechanism [12]. We have shown that following depletion of B220+ cells, survival rates decreased as much as 100% relative to non-depleted controls and individual CD4/CD8-depleted <span class="yellow">mice</span> via the intraperitoneal route. Results from C57BL/6 <span class="yellow">mice</span> deficient in mature B-cells (μMT), CD4 T-cells (CD4-/-) or CD8 T-cells (CD8-/-) substantiate the requirement for B-cell involvement by evidence of μMT and CD4-/- decreased survival. The lack of an effective CTL response to vaccination did not appear to alter survival in what would appear to be a CD4/B-cell (humoral)-driven response. In CD4-deficient <span class="yellow">mice</span>, we have the additional potential variable that a CD4-dependent antibody response might also be inhibited during the vaccination phase relative to <span class="yellow">mice</span> treated with antibody immediately prior to and during the early phases of infection. Although not statistically significant, we did observe a decrease in survival in μMT (mature B cell) deficient <span class="yellow">mice</span> as early as day 9 post challenge, whereas CD4-deficient <span class="yellow">mice</span> produced similar results at day 32 post challenge, indicating a role for B cells independent of CD4 T cell help, perhaps through a T-independent mechanism of antibody production. Although CD8-/- C57BL/6 demonstrated no decreased survival in our HK-vaccinated model, a lack of potential endogenous protein production by HK <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> may have contributed to limited MHC-I presentation.
Complement associated studies revealed increased J774A.1 uptake of serum-treated <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span>. Complement-mediated uptake studies of <span class="yellow">B. pseudomallei</span> by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) suggest that capsule production contributes to resistance of phagocytosis by reducing C3b bacterial deposition [13]. Previous studies have demonstrated that a polysaccharide capsule is present in <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span>, [14,15] although in the present study enhanced uptake with serum-treated <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> was observed. Intracellular survival assays of complement mediated uptake of organisms were not performed in the present study, thus, the role of complement opsonization on intracellular survival is not fully resolved. Previous reports have demonstrated the ability of <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> to survive within macrophage without the aid of serum coating organisms [16]. Conversely, the idea of antibody mediated opsonization to facilitate macrophage activation and clearance of intracellular organisms may offer support to the role of B cells in an effective immune response. A possible protective mechanism may include HK vaccination induced production of opsonizing antibodies which may aid in complement mediated uptake, thereby limiting the initial bacterial threshold below a lethal level.
Immunoglobulin responses to HK vaccination resulted in modest levels of IgG1 following 2 weeks post vaccination, while post-exposure levels were indicative of efficient class switching to a favorable IgG2a isotype. Importantly, cobra venom factor treatment of animals at time of vaccination did not alter their ability to produce immunoglobulin. In fact, cobra venom factor treated animals resulted in higher IgG2a levels when compared to non-treated. Complement activation can modulate both the primary and secondary immune responses and has been shown to enhance secondary immune responses to vaccination [17]. The current results suggest that cobra venom factor treatment may affect the modulation of the immune response to <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> infection through B cell activation and/or memory B cell generation.<br><br>Conclusion
In summary, our results provide a basis for future studies of protection via vaccination using either subunit or whole-organism vaccine preparations from lethal infection in the experimental BALB/c <span class="yellow">mouse</span> model. Understanding and defining the role of B cells in adaptive <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> immunity will likely be fundamental to the design of an efficacious vaccine and important goals of future research.<br><br>Methods
Bacterial strain and <span class="yellow">mice</span>
<span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> strain ATCC 23344 (China 7) was cultured on Luria-Bertani agar supplemented with 4% glycerol (LB+4%G) agar plates for 48 h at 37°C. Isolated colonies were sub-cultured to LB+4%G broth, and cultures were incubated at 37°C until optical density readings at 600 nm (OD600) reached an exponential phase of growth. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation, washed and re-suspended in sterile 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) to obtain the desired CFU/ml. To obtain HK inoculums, bacterial suspensions were incubated at 85°C for 3 h and stored at 4°C until use. The absence of live <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> organisms in the HK preparations was confirmed after plating 10% of the total inoculums (v/v) and incubating these at 37°C for 48 h. All procedures were performed under a class II biosafety cabinet in a biosafety level 3 laboratory. Female, 6- to 8-week-old, BALB/c <span class="yellow">mice</span> (n = 5–7) were obtained from Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc. (Indianapolis, Indiana). Female, 6- to 8-week-old, C57BL/6 <span class="yellow">mice</span> deficient in mature B-cells (μMT), CD4 T-cells (CD4-/-) and CD8 T-cells (CD8-/-) and wild-type <span class="yellow">mice</span> were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine).<br><br>Vaccination and challenge
BALB/c and C57BL/6 <span class="yellow">mice</span> were grouped and vaccinated with 0.5 μg of HK <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> (without adjuvant) by i.p. injection using a 25-gauge syringe. Two weeks post HK vaccination <span class="yellow">mice</span> were injected i.p. with 2 × 107 CFU/100 μl of live <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> (~20 LD50) [18]. Complement depleted animals were challenged with 2.5 × 104 CFU/50 μl (~0.25 LD50) by intranasal (i.n.) route. Aliquots from the inoculums were plated to confirm the infecting dose. All procedures and animal protocols used in this study were approved by the Biosafety and IACUC committees at UTMB and conducted in either BSL-3 or ABSL-3 laboratories.<br><br>Cell and cytokine depletions
Acute in vivo cell/cytokine depletion was performed with monoclonal <span class="yellow">rat</span> anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> CD4 (GK1.5), CD8α (53-6.7) or B220 (RA3-6B2) obtained from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN) by methods similar to those we have previously described [19]. Functional grade purified <span class="yellow">rat</span> anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> interferon-gamma (IFN-γ, AN-18) was obtained from eBioscience (San Diego, CA) and purified anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α, MP6-XT3) from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). IFN-γ and TNF-α antibodies were injected i.p. 6 h prior to challenge, 200 μg per <span class="yellow">mouse</span> in 200 μl PBS or at later time points as indicated. <span class="yellow">Rat</span> IgG isotype control was obtained from Southern Biotech (Birmingham, AL) and administered i.p. on day of challenge, 200 μg/<span class="yellow">mouse</span>. <span class="yellow">Rat</span> anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> CD4, CD8α and B220 were injected i.p. twice, 1 day prior to challenge and on day of challenge, with an equivalent dosage sufficient to deplete T or B cells from 6 × 108 bone marrow cells per injection. The efficiency of depletion at time of infection for CD4+, CD8+, and B220+ cells was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis immediately prior to infection.<br><br>Complement depletion with cobra venom factor
<span class="yellow">Mice</span>, six to seven per group, were vaccinated i.p. with 1 × 105 CFU of nonviable <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> cell preparation in a total volume of 0.1 ml. Two weeks later, 24 h and 1 h before challenge, complement depleted <span class="yellow">mice</span> were treated i.p. with 12.5 units total cobra venom factor (Quidel Corporation Speciality Products, San Diego, CA) in 0.1 ml of PBS. Complement depletion was confirmed prior to challenge by micro-titer hemolytic complement activity (CH50) assay as previously described [20].<br><br><span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> J774A.1 uptake assays
J774A.1 cells were seeded (5 × 105) onto Corning costar 24 well plates (Corning, NY) with DMEM and incubated overnight at 37°C with 5% CO2. Bacterial suspensions were incubated at 37°C for 45 minutes supplemented with 2% <span class="yellow">mouse</span> serum from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO.), heat inactivated <span class="yellow">mouse</span> serum (56°C 30 minutes), or bacteria alone and then added at an MOI of 10:1 to J774A.1 cells in triplicate. Inoculated wells were centrifuged at 800 g for 2 minutes and incubated for 2 hours at 37°C with 5% CO2 followed by a PBS wash (×2) and 2 hour incubation with 250 μg/ml kanamycin. Wells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by serial 10-fold dilutions plated on LBG plates and incubated at 37°C for 2 days. Colony forming units were enumerated and uptake expressed as a percentage of initial inoculating dose ± SEM.<br><br>Antibodies and flow cytometry
Flow cytometric analysis was performed on 0.1-ml blood samples transferred to micro centrifuge tubes containing 90 μl of acid citrate dextrose (ACD) solution. Red blood cells were lysed using ACK-lysing buffer (Biosource International, Inc., Camarillo, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Antibodies used for analysis of surface markers included: FITC-conjugated <span class="yellow">rat</span> anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> CD45R/B220 (RA3-6B2, BD Pharmingen San Diego, CA) for B cells; FITC-conjugated <span class="yellow">rat</span> anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> CD8α (53-6.7) and CD4 (GK1.5, BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) for CD8+ or CD4+ cells, respectively. Samples evaluated for CD4+ and CD8α+ cells were also incubated with biotin-conjugated <span class="yellow">hamster</span> anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> CD3e (145-2C11) monoclonal antibody (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) and subsequently with streptavidin APC Cy7. Isotype-matched, non-specific controls were assayed in parallel (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Surface staining was performed according to previously published protocols [21]. Following cell staining, the samples were fixed with 2% buffered paraformaldehyde overnight prior to analysis by flow cytometry. Samples were analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer with BD CellQuest Pro software.<br><br>Antibody assays
Immunoglobulin subclass IgG1 and IgG2a titers in <span class="yellow">mice</span> were determined by a whole bacterial cell ELISA performed in 96-well, Immulon 2 HB, round-bottom plates (Dynex Technologies). <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> antigen was diluted in 0.1 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.5) and 50 μl of diluted cells placed into wells. Plates were stored overnight at 4°C. The plates were washed with washing solution (1× PBS, 0.05% Tween 20), and incubated with 100 μl of blocking solution (1× PBS, 1% <span class="yellow">bovine</span> serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at 37°C. Dilutions of <span class="yellow">mouse</span> sera were made with blocking solution in duplicate and plates were incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Following incubation, plates were washed and 50 μl of anti-Ig-<span class="blue">horseradish</span> peroxidase subclass conjugate, diluted accordingly to manufacturer's instructions (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc. Birmingham, Ala.), was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. After washing, 50 μl of 2,2'-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzthizoline)-6-sulfonate (ABTS) peroxidase substrate (KPL, Inc., Gaithersburg, Maryland) was added to each well and plates incubated for 25 min at room temperature. The amount of bound antibody was determined colorimetrically by absorbance at 405 nm.<br><br>Statistical analysis
Survival curves were calculated by Kaplan Meier survival analysis with log-rank tests between groups using GraphPad Prism (V.4.03 for windows). Statistical analysis was generally performed with the paired Student's t-test. P value ≤ 0.05 was considered significant.<br><br>
