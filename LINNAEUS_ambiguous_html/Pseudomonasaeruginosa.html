Abstract
Fungi and oomycetes are the causal agents of many of the most serious diseases of plants. Here we report a detailed comparative analysis of the genome sequences of thirty-six species of fungi and oomycetes, including seven plant pathogenic species, that aims to explore the common genetic features associated with plant disease-causing species. The predicted translational products of each genome have been clustered into groups of potential orthologues using Markov Chain Clustering and the data integrated into the e-Fungi object-oriented data warehouse (http://www.e-fungi.org.uk/). Analysis of the species distribution of members of these clusters has identified proteins that are specific to filamentous fungal species and a group of proteins found only in plant pathogens. By comparing the gene inventories of filamentous, ascomycetous phytopathogenic and free-living species of fungi, we have identified a set of gene families that appear to have expanded during the evolution of phytopathogens and may therefore serve important roles in plant disease. We have also characterised the predicted set of secreted proteins encoded by each genome and identified a set of protein families which are significantly over-represented in the secretomes of plant pathogenic fungi, including putative effector proteins that might perturb host cell biology during plant infection. The results demonstrate the potential of comparative genome analysis for exploring the evolution of eukaryotic microbial pathogenesis.<br><br>Introduction
Fungi and oomycetes are responsible for many of the world's most devastating plant diseases including late blight disease of <span class="yellow">potato</span>, caused by the oomycete pathogen <span class="yellow">Phytophthora infestans</span> and <span class="yellow">rice</span> blast disease caused by the ascomycete fungus <span class="yellow">Magnaporthe grisea</span>, both of which are responsible for very significant harvest losses each year. The enormous diversity of crop diseases caused by these eukaryotic micro-organisms poses a difficult challenge to the development of durable disease control strategies. Identifying common underlying molecular mechanisms necessary for pathogenesis in a wide range of pathogenic species is therefore a major goal of current research. Approximately 100,000 species of fungi have so far been described, but only a very small proportion of these are pathogenic [1]. Phylogenetic studies have, meanwhile, shown that disease-causing pathogens are not necessarily closely-related to each other, and in fact are spread throughout all taxonomic groups of fungi, often showing a close evolutionary relationship to non-pathogenic species [2], [3]. It therefore seems likely that phytopathogenicity has evolved as a trait many times during fungal and oomycete evolution [1] and in some groups may be ancestral to the more recent emergence of saprotrophic species. A significant effort has gone into the identification of pathogenicity determinants– individual genes that are essential for a pathogen to invade a host plant successfully, but which are dispensable for saprophytic growth [4], [5]. However, far from being novel proteins encoded only by the genomes of pathogenic fungi, many of the genes identified so far encode components of conserved signalling pathways that are found in all species of fungi, such as the mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases [6], adenylate cyclase [7] and G-protein subunits [8]. The MAP kinase pathways, for example, have been studied extensively in the budding <span class="yellow">yeast</span> <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> and trigger morphological and biochemical changes in response to external stimuli such as starvation stress or hyperosmotic conditions [9]. In pathogenic fungi, components of these pathways have evolved instead to regulate the morphological changes associated with plant infection. For example, appressorium formation in the <span class="yellow">rice blast fungus</span> <span class="yellow">Magnaporthe grisea</span>, stimulated by hard, hydrophobic surfaces is regulated by a MAP kinase cascade [10]. This pathway deploys novel classes of G-protein coupled receptors not found in the genome of <span class="yellow">S. cerevisiae</span> [11], but the inductive signal is transmitted via a MAP kinase, Pmk1, that is a functional homologue of the <span class="yellow">yeast</span> Fus3 MAP kinase where it serves a role in pheromone signalling [10]. Similarly, conserved metabolic pathways such as the glyoxylate cycle and amino acid biosynthesis are also important for pathogenesis [12]–[14]. This may in some cases reflect the nutritional environment the pathogen encounters when growing in the host plant tissue, and in others shows the importance of simple metabolites for pathogenic processes, such as the role of glycerol as a compatible solute for generating turgor pressure in the appressorium of <span class="yellow">M. grisea</span> [15]. It is undoubtedly the case, however, that identification of such genes has also been a consequence of the manner in which these studies have been carried out, often using <span class="yellow">yeast</span> as a model organism to test hypotheses concerning the developmental biology and biochemistry of plant pathogenic species.
Other pathogenicity factors identified to date have been shown to be involved in functions associated with host infection, such as plant cell wall degradation, toxin biosynthesis and protection against plant defences [reviewed in 5]. Identification of a pathogenicity factor generally involves making a mutant fungal strain with a non-functioning version of the gene by targeted gene deletion and assaying the ability of the mutant to cause disease. Therefore, most pathogenicity factors identified so far, have been validated in only a small number of genetically tractable pathogenic fungi, such as <span class="yellow">M. grisea</span> and the <span class="yellow">corn</span> smut <span class="yellow">Ustilago maydis</span> and many of the advances in understanding the developmental biology of plant infection have occurred in these model pathogens [16], [17]. However, there are severe limitations to studying pathogenicity by mutating one gene at a time and working predominantly with a hypothesis-driven, reverse genetics approach. Many virulence-associated processes, for instance, such as the development of infection structures and haustoria, are likely to involve a large number of gene products and so there is likely to be redundancy in gene function. One example of this is cutinase, a type of methyl esterase that hydrolyses the protective cutin layer present on the outside of the plant epidermis. Cutinase was excluded as a pathogencity factor for <span class="yellow">M. grisea</span> on the basis that a mutant strain containing a non-functional cutinase-encoding gene was still able to cause <span class="yellow">rice</span> blast disease [18]. However, sequencing of the <span class="yellow">M. grisea</span> genome has shown the presence of eight potential cutinase-encoding genes implicated in virulence [19]. Additionally, targeted gene deletion is not feasible in many important pathogens and the normal definition of fungal pathogenicity cannot be applied in the case of obligate biotrophs, such as the powdery mildew fungus <span class="yellow">Blumeria graminis</span>, which cannot be cultured away from living host plants. Therefore, new approaches are needed to identify genes that are vital for the process of pathogenicity. These include high-throughput methods such as microarray analysis, serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), insertional mutagenesis, proteomics and metabolomics [19], [20] and are dependent on the availability of genome sequence information.
After the initial release of the genome of the budding <span class="yellow">yeast</span> <span class="yellow">S. cerevisiae</span> in 1996 [21], the number of publicly available sequenced fungal genomes has recently risen very quickly. A large number of fungal genome sequences are now publicly available, including those from several phytopathogenic fungi, including <span class="yellow">M. grisea</span> [22], <span class="yellow">Ustilago maydis</span> [23], <span class="yellow">Gibberella zeae</span> [24] (the causal agent of head blight of <span class="yellow">wheat</span> and <span class="yellow">barley</span>), <span class="yellow">Stagonospora nodorum</span> [25] (the causal agent of glume blotch of <span class="yellow">wheat</span>), the grey mould fungus <span class="yellow">Botrytis cinerea</span> and the white mould fungus <span class="yellow">Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</span> [reviewed in 19]. Comparison of gene inventories of pathogenic and non-pathogenic organisms offers the most direct means of providing new information concerning the mechanisms involved in fungal and oomycete pathogenicity. In this report, we have developed and utilized the e-Fungi object-oriented data warehouse [26], which contains data from 36 species of fungi and oomycetes and deploys a range of querying tools to allow interrogation of a significant amount of genome data in unparalleled detail. We report the identification of new gene families that are over represented in the genomes of filamentous ascomycete phytopathogens and define gene sets that are specific to diverse fungal pathogen species. We also report the putatively secreted protein sets which are produced by plant pathogenic fungi and which may play significant roles in plant infection.<br><br>Results
Identification of orthologous gene sets from fungal and oomcyete genomes
Genome sequences and sets of predicted proteins were analysed from 34 species of fungi and 2 species of oomycete (Table 1). In order to compare such a large number of genomes, an object-oriented data warehouse has been constructed known as e-Fungi [26] which integrates genomic data with a variety of functional data and has a powerful set of queries that enables sophisticated, whole-genome comparisons to be performed. To compare genome inventories, the entire set of predicted proteins from the 36 species (348,787 proteins) were clustered using Markov Chain Clustering [27] as described previously [28], [29]. A total of 282,061 predicted proteins were grouped into 23,724 clusters, each cluster representing a group of putative orthologues. The remaining 66,934 sequences were singletons, the products of unique genes. A total of 165 clusters contained proteins from all 36 species used in this study (Table S1). Not surprisingly, they included many proteins involved in basic cellular processes, such as ribosomal proteins, components of transcription, translation and DNA replication apparatus, cytoskeletal proteins, histones, proteins involved in the secretory pathway, protein folding, protein sorting and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and enzymes involved in primary metabolism. Only 16 clusters contained proteins that were found in all 34 species of fungi, but which were absent from the two species of oomycete (Table S2). This number of fungal-specific clusters is surprisingly low considering the phylogenetic distance between the oomycetes and fungi [30]. The list however, is consistent with the fundamental differences in biology between fungi and oomycetes and included proteins involved in fungal septation, glycosylation, transcriptional regulation, cell signalling, as well as two amino-acyl tRNA synthetases. The obligate mammalian pathogen <span class="yellow">Encephalitozoon cuniculi</span>, a microsporidian fungus, has a reduced genome that codes only for 1,997 proteins and lacks genes encoding enzymes of many primary metabolic pathways such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle, fatty acid β-oxidation, biosynthetic enzymes of the vast majority of amino acids, fatty acids and nucleotides, as well as components of the respiratory electron transport chain and F1-F0 ATP synthase. It also lacks mitochondria and peroxisomes [31]. Therefore, we reasoned that the inclusion of this species in the analysis of MCL clusters is likely to result in underestimation of the number of groups of conserved proteins. By discarding <span class="yellow">E. cuniculi</span>, there are 377 clusters that contained proteins from 35 species of fungi and oomycetes (Table S3). This relatively small number of fungal-conserved clusters reflects the large evolutionary distance between members of the fungal kingdom, as well as complex patterns of gene gains and losses during the evolution of fungi. Basidiomycetes and ascomycetes are thought to have diverged nearly 1,000 million years ago [32] and the Saccharomycotina alone are more evolutionarily diverged than the Chordate phylum of the animal kingdom [33]. Since the divergence of Saccharomycotina (hemiascomycetes) and Pezizomycotina (euascomycetes), the genomes of the latter have greatly increased in size, partly due to the appearance of novel genes related to the filamentous lifestyle. Lineage-specific gene losses have also been shown in a number of hemiascomycete species [34]. As well as the groups of proteins mentioned above (Table S1), the fungal-conserved clusters included those containing enzymes from primary metabolic pathways not present in <span class="yellow">E. cuniculi</span>, such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle, amino acid metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, cholesterol biosynthesis and nucleotide metabolism, as well as components of the respiratory electron transport chain and F1-F0 ATP synthase. The conserved protein clusters also include a number of transporters (including mitochondrial transporters), enzymes involved in haem biosynthesis, autophagy-related proteins, those involved in protein targeting to the peroxisome and vacuole and additional groups of proteins involved in signal transduction that are not present in <span class="yellow">E. cuniculi</span> (including those involved in inosine triphosphate and leukotriene metabolism). The analysis also showed there were 105 clusters that contained proteins from 33 species of fungi (excluding <span class="yellow">E. cuniculi</span>), but not from the two species of oomycete (see Table S4). As well as those mentioned previously (Table S2), the group includes a number of clusters of transporters that are conserved in fungi but not found in oomycetes, as well as proteins involved in fungal cell wall synthesis, and lipid metabolism. It may be the case that the genomes of oomycete species do not possess orthologues of the fungal genes in these clusters, or alternatively, the large evolutionary distance between the oomycetes and fungi mean that the corresponding orthologues from each Kingdom cluster separately.<br><br>Comparative analysis of yeasts and filamentous fungi
One striking difference in the morphology of species of fungi is between those that have a filamentous, multi-cellular growth habit and those that grow as single <span class="yellow">yeast</span> cells. There is some overlap between these two groups; because some fungi are dimorphic or even pleiomorphic, switching between different growth forms depending on environmental conditions or the stage of their life cycle. For example, the <span class="yellow">corn</span>-smut fungus <span class="yellow">Ustilago maydis</span> can exist saprophytically as haploid <span class="yellow">yeast</span>-like cells, but needs to form a dikaryotic filamentous growth form in order to infect the host plant [23]. Generally the genomes of the filamentous fungi contain more protein-encoding genes (9,000–17,000) than those from unicellular yeasts (5,000–7,000), perhaps reflecting their greater morphological complexity and secondary metabolic capacity. <span class="yellow">U. maydis</span>, however, has 6,522 protein encoding genes, perhaps reflecting its lack of extensive secondary metabolic pathways and its potential usefulness in defining the minimal gene sets associated with biotrophic growth [23]. The increase in proteome size in filamentous ascomycetes may be due to the expansion of certain gene families or the presence of novel genes that are essential for the filamentous lifestyle.
For the purposes of this study, the filamentous fungi were defined as the filamentous ascomycetes (subphylum Pezizomycotina), basidiomycetes and zygomycetes and the unicellular fungi were defined as the budding yeasts (order Saccharomycetales), the archiascomycete <span class="yellow">Schizosaccharomyces pombe</span> and the microsporidian fungus <span class="yellow">Encephalitozoon cuniculi</span>. A total of 37 MCL clusters contained proteins from all species of filamentous fungi, but no species of unicellular fungi (Table 2). Interestingly, eight of these clusters also contained proteins from both species of oomycete represented in e-Fungi. The filamentous-fungal specific clusters included a number of proteins that are involved in cytoskeletal rearrangements (dedicator of cytokinesis protein, integrin beta-1-binding protein, dynactin p62 family, dynein light intermediate chain 2), it seems likely that these are required for the complex morphological changes that filamentous fungi undergo during their lifecycle and the production of differentiated cells, such as spores, fruiting bodies and infection structures. The results also suggest that filamentous fungal species make a greater use of lipids as signalling molecules than <span class="yellow">yeast</span> species. For example, the occurrence of filamentous fungal-specific clusters representing two groups of lysophospholipases, as well as ceramidases that are involved in sphingolipid signalling [35] and linoleate diol synthases that can catalyse the formation of leukotrienes [36]. Interestingly, one of the products of linoleate diol synthase has been shown to be a sporulation hormone in <span class="yellow">Aspergillus nidulans</span> [37]. There is also a cluster that represents homologues of a novel <span class="yellow">human</span> gene (LRP16) that acts downstream of a steroid receptor and promotes cell proliferation [38]. Two clusters of filamentous fungal-specific proteins represent enzymes involved in molypterin biosynthesis (MCL2420, MCL2581). Molypterin is a molybdenum-containing co-factor for nitrate reductase, an enzyme that is known to be absent from the species of <span class="yellow">yeast</span> used in this study [39]. Both these clusters are also found in oomycetes. There are other clusters representing proteins important for activities specific to filamentous fungi, such as homologues of Pro11 (striatin) which regulates fruiting body formation in <span class="yellow">Sordaria macrospora</span> [40], the vegetatible incompatibility protein HET-E-1, which prevents the formation of heterokaryons between incompatible fungal strains in <span class="yellow">Podospora anserina</span> [41], anucleate primary sterigmata protein A from <span class="yellow">Aspergillus nidulans</span>, which is essential for nuclear migration and conidiophore development [42] and cytochrome P450 and polyketide synthase-encoding genes, both of which are involved in a number of secondary metabolic pathways including toxin biosynthesis [43].<br><br>Pathogenicity-associated gene functions in fungi
As the selected set of fungi includes both saprotrophic and pathogenic species, this allows us to compare the gene inventories of phytopathogenic and closely related non-pathogenic fungi to look for genes that are unique to phytopathogens. Analysis of MCL clusters showed that there were no clusters that contained proteins from all species of fungal phytopathogen in e-Fungi (namely <span class="yellow">B. cinerea</span>, <span class="yellow">Eremothecium gossypii</span>, <span class="yellow">G. zeae</span>, <span class="yellow">M. grisea</span>, <span class="yellow">S. sclerotiorum</span>, <span class="yellow">S. nodorum</span> and <span class="yellow">U. maydis</span>) but did not contain proteins from non-pathogenic species. There were, however, four clusters that were exclusive to filamentous ascomycete phytopathogens (namely <span class="yellow">B. cinerea</span>, <span class="yellow">G. zeae</span>, <span class="yellow">M. grisea</span>, <span class="yellow">S. sclerotiorum</span>, <span class="yellow">S. nodorum</span> as shown in Table 3). Significantly, none of the members of these clusters had homology to any known proteins or contained motifs from the Pfam database [44], so we were unable to predict their function, although two of the clusters (MCL4854 and MCL8229) consisted entirely of proteins that were predicted to be secreted. Taken together, the observations indicate that a battery of completely novel secreted proteins may be associated with ascomycete fungal pathogens.
Pathogenicity factors have been defined as genes that are essential for successful completion of the pathogen lifecycle but dispensable for saprophytic growth [4]. This is an experimental definition based on whether null mutations of a given gene reduce the virulence of the pathogen on its host. We wished to ascertain whether homologues of previously characterised and experimentally-validated pathogenicity factors were limited to the genomes of pathogenic species. A search was therefore made for pathogenicity factors that have been identified experimentally for the species of phytopathogens represented in e-Fungi using PHI-base, the plant-host interaction database [45]. The matching locus was identified for each pathogenicity factor in the corresponding genome sequence by comparing a published protein sequence with sets of predicted proteins for each genome using BLASTP. This produced a list of 105 pathogenicity factors, although corresponding loci could not be found in genome sequences for all the published genes (see Table S5). MCL clusters containing these proteins were identified (76 unique clusters) and the species distribution of members of these clusters analysed. In total, 29 of the MCL clusters contained pathogenicity factors with members from at least 34 of the 36 species represented in e-Fungi (Table 4). Not surprisingly, many of these clusters contain conserved components of signalling pathways such as protein kinases, adenylate cyclases, G-proteins and cell cycle regulators. Cellular morphogenesis is known to be important for infection of the host plant by many phytopathogens, for example, in appressorium formation in <span class="yellow">Magnaporthe grisea</span> [46] or the switch in the growth form of <span class="yellow">Ustilago maydis</span> from <span class="yellow">yeast</span>-like growth to filamentous invasive growth [47]. Links between successful plant infection and cell cycle control have also been demonstrated [48]. It seems likely that conserved signalling pathways that control activities, such as mating and morphogenesis in all fungi, have evolved to control processes essential for pathogencity in phytopathogens. Other conserved pathogenicity factors encode enzymes of metabolic pathways that are present in nearly all fungi, but seem to be important for the life cycle of particular pathogenic species, for example, enzymes involved in beta-oxidation of fatty acids, the glyoxylate shunt, amino acid metabolism and the utilisation of stored sugars. When considered together, this may indicate that nutritional conditions which fungi encounter when invading host plant tissue require mobilisation of stored lipids prior to nutrition being extracted from the host plant. Seventeen of the MCL clusters containing pathogenicity factors were specific to filamentous ascomycetes (Table 5). These include a number of enzymes involved in secondary metabolism, such as those involved in the synthesis of the fungal toxin trichothecene in <span class="yellow">G. zeae</span> [43] and those involved in melanin biosynthesis [49], as well as structural proteins, some of which are components of differentiated cell types not seen in yeasts, for example, hydrophobins which are components of aerial structures such as fruiting bodies [50] but are also involved in pathogenicity [16]. There also seems to be a number of filamentous ascomycete specific receptor proteins (transducin beta-subunit, G-protein coupled receptor, tetraspanins) that have evolved in pathogens to be used in sensing environmental cues that are essential for successful infection of the host [51]. The Woronin body is a structure found only in filamentous ascomycetes, and has been shown to be essential for pathogenicity in <span class="yellow">M. grisea</span> [52]. A major constituent of the woronin body, encoded by MVP1, is a pathogenicity factor for <span class="yellow">M. grisea</span>, but also has homologues in nearly all species of filamentous ascomycetes. Two proteins that were initially discovered as being highly expressed in the appressoria of <span class="yellow">M. grisea</span> and essential for pathogenicity (Mas1 and Mas3) [53] also have homologues in a number of species of filamentous fungi (Table 5). Thus, many innovations that have allowed filamentous ascomycetes to have a more complex morphology than unicellular yeasts have also evolved to be essential for plant infection by phytopathogenic species. Interestingly, none of the MCL clusters containing known pathogenicity factors contained members only from phytopathogenic fungi, apart from those that were restricted to just one species. These are therefore likely to represent highly-specialised proteins that have evolved for the specific lifecycle of just one species of phytopathogen, for example the Pwl proteins involved in determining host range of different strains of <span class="yellow">M. grisea</span> [54]. Two of the proteins specific to <span class="yellow">M. grisea</span>, the metallothionein Mmt1 [55] and the hydrophobin Mpg1 [56] are small polypeptides and are members of highly divergent gene families, other members of which do not cluster together using BLASTP.<br><br>Comparative analysis of plant-pathogenic and saprotrophic filamentous ascomycetes
Based on the analysis reported, it is likely that in general there are a large number of differences in gene inventories between filamentous and <span class="yellow">yeast</span>-like fungi. Therefore, in order to compare the genomes of phytopathogens and saprotrophs, we focused on filamentous ascomycetes in order to resolve in greater detail the distinct differences in gene sets between these two ecologically separate groups of fungi. In this way differences due to phylogeny between the species would be minimised. We compared the gene inventories of the phytopathogens <span class="yellow">B. cinerea</span>, <span class="yellow">G. zeae</span>, <span class="yellow">M. grisea</span>, <span class="yellow">S. sclerotiorum</span>, <span class="yellow">S. nodorum</span> with the non-pathogens <span class="yellow">Aspergillus nidulans</span>, <span class="yellow">Chaetomium globosum</span>, <span class="yellow">Neurospora crassa</span> and <span class="yellow">Trichoderma reesei</span>. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the phytopathogenic species do not form a separate clade from the pathogenic species (Figure 1), [3] and we assumed that differences in gene inventory should therefore reflect lifestyle rather than evolutionary distance. In order for such a comparison to be considered valid, the completeness and quality of the fungal genome sequences used should, however, also be comparable. Table S6 summarises the available data about genome sequence coverage, genome size and the number of predicted proteins for each species. This shows that the genome coverage is greater than 5x and the number of predicted proteins in the range of 10,000–16,000 for all genomes used, suggesting a high level of equivalence between species with regard to sequence quality. From our work it seems unlikely that there are pathogenicity factors conserved in, and specific to, all species of phytopathogen. It may, for instance, be the case that differences in the gene inventories are due to the expansion of certain gene families in the genomes of phytopathogenic species associated with functions necessary for pathogenesis. To define protein families, we used the Pfam database which contains protein family models based on Hidden Markov Models [44], [57]. Sets of predicted proteins for each fungal species in e-Fungi were analysed for the occurrence of Pfam motifs and the number of proteins containing each domain across fungal species ascertained. The sets of predicted protein sequences used in this study have been automatically predicted as part of each individual genome project and are likely to contain a number of artefactual sequences. The use of Pfam motifs to define gene families in this study reduces the likelihood of such sequences affecting the data, since Pfam motifs are based on multiple sequence alignments of well-studied proteins.
A small number of Pfam motifs were not found in the proteomes of the filamentous ascomycete non-pathogens, but were found in the proteomes of at least three species of filamentous ascomycete phytopathogens (Table 6). These include the Cas1p-like motif (PF07779), found in 4 species of phytopathogen, including five copies in <span class="yellow">G. zeae</span>, and the <span class="yellow">Yeast</span> cell wall synthesis protein KRE9/KNH1 motif (PF05390), which was found in three species of phytopathogen. Cas1p is a membrane protein necessary for the O-acetylation of the capsular polysaccharide of the basidiomycete animal pathogen <span class="yellow">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> [58]. KRE9 and KNH1 are involved in the synthesis of cell surface polysaccharides in <span class="yellow">S. cerevisiae</span> [59]. Taken together this suggests that synthesis of cell surface polysaccharides is important for phytopathogens, perhaps helping to shroud the fungus from plant defences. The function of the YDG/SRA domain motif (PF02182) is unknown, but is found in a novel <span class="yellow">mouse</span> cell proliferation protein Np95, in which the domain is important both for the interaction with histones and for chromatin binding in vivo [60]. As well as domains of unknown function, the list of phytopathogen-specific Pfam motifs includes Allophanate hydrolase (PF02682) which is found in an enzyme involved in the ATP-dependent urea degradation pathway [61], a peptidase motif, an opioid growth receptor motif (PF04664) and Mnd1 (PF03962), which is involved in recombination and meiotic nuclear division [62].
To detect potential gene family expansion, we decided to identify Pfam motifs that were present in both phytopathogenic and non-pathogenic species of filamentous ascomycetes, but that were more common in the genomes of the former. The Pfam motifs were ranked on the ratio of the mean number of proteins containing each motif in phytopathogens, when compared to non-pathogens (Table 7). The tables only show ratios of greater than or equal to 2.5. Pfam motifs that were more common in the proteomes of pathogens, include some found in enzymes involved in secondary metabolic pathways. These include novel enzymes that have only previously been studied in non-fungal species, such as the chalcone synthases; type III polyketide synthases involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoids in plants [63] and lipoxygenases; components of metabolic pathways resulting in the synthesis of physiologically-active compounds such as eicosanoids in mammals [64] and jasmonic acid in plants [65] as well as antibiotic synthesis monooxygenases. It seems likely that secondary metabolism is essential in phytopathogenic species for the synthesis of mycotoxins, antibiotics, siderophores and pigments [66], but it may also offer fungal pathogens a distinct alternative means of perturbing host metabolism, cell signalling or plant defence, in contrast to bacterial pathogens that rely on protein secretion to achieve this. There also seems to be number of protease and peptidase domains that are more common in the genomes of phytopathogens as well as domains from two classes of cell-wall degrading enzymes: namely cutinase (PF01083) and Glycosyl hydrolase family 53 (PF07745) which is found in arabinogalactan endo-1,4-beta-galactosidases that hydrolyze the galactan side chains that form part of the complex carbohydrate structure of pectin [67]. Two other domains found in enzymes involved in pectin degradation, pectinesterase (PF01095) and Glycosyl hydrolases family 28 (PF00295) are both more than twice as common in the genomes of phytopathogens than saprotrophs. In contrast, domains found in cellulases have fairly equal distribution between the proteomes of phytopathogens and non-pathogens (data not shown). Therefore, for phytopathogens the most essential enzymes for pathogenesis may well be those that allow the fungus to penetrate the protective cutin layer of the plant epidermis and disrupt the pectin matrix of the plant cell wall in which cellulose fibrils are embedded. Pectin-degrading enzymes have already been shown to be pathogenicity factors in a number of fungi [68]. NPP1 motifs are characteristic of a group of proteins called NLPs (Nep1-like proteins) that trigger defence responses, necrosis and cell death in plants and may act as virulence factors [69]. The NLPs are more common in the genomes of phytopathogenic, when compared to non-pathogenic ascomycetes, but are even more numerous in the proteomes of the oomycetes (64 proteins in <span class="yellow">Phytophthora ramorum</span> and 75 in <span class="yellow">Phytophthora sojae</span>). Proteins containing the Chitin recognition protein domain (PF00187) are also very common in the proteomes of phytopathogens (18 in <span class="yellow">M. grisea</span> and 16 in <span class="yellow">S. nodorum</span>). A role for chitin-binding proteins has been proposed in protecting the fungal cell wall from chitinases produced by host plants [70]. There are also two other Pfam motifs, which are more common in the proteomes of phytopathogens, that are found in enzymes involved in the catabolism of toxic compounds, namely arylesterase (PF01731) and EthD protein (PF07110) which breakdown organophosphorus esters [71] and ethyl tert-butyl ether [72], respectively.<br><br>Comparative secretome analysis of phytopathogenic and saprotrophic filamentous ascomycetes
Studies in bacterial pathogens and oomycetes have shown that a range of secreted proteins known as effectors are important for establishing infection of the host plant [73], [74]. These secreted proteins may disable plant defences and subvert cellular processes to suit the needs of invading pathogens. Therefore, we decided also to compare gene family size in the secretomes of phytopathogens and non-pathogens. There are a number of programs available that predict whether a protein is likely to be secreted, although the predictions they give significantly differ from each other. Therefore we defined the secretome of each fungal species based on those proteins that are predicted to be secreted by two different programs: SignalP 3.0 [75] and WoLFPSORT [76]. The size of each secretome is summarised in Figure 2. Even when using two programs, the sizes of predicted secretomes can vary greatly. For example, a similar analysis for <span class="yellow">M. grisea</span> using SignalP and ProtComp (www.Softberry.com) predicted only 739 secreted proteins (out of a proteome of 11,109) compared to our prediction of 1,546 secreted proteins (out of a proteome of 12,841) [22]. The size of the secretomes for each species varied from 5%–12% of the total proteome. Overall, the size of the secretomes from phytopathogens did not differ greatly from that of non-pathogens.
Table 8 shows a list of Pfam motifs, not found in the secretomes of non-pathogenic filamentous ascomycetes, that were present in at least three phytopathogenic fungal species. The Isochorismatase motif (PF00857) was found in the secretomes of all five species of phytopathogen. Isochorismatase catalyses the conversion of isochorismate to 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate and pyruvate. It has been implicated in the synthesis of the anti-microbial compound phenazine by <span class="blue">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> [77] and the siderophore, enterobactin, by <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span> [78]. The isochorismatase motif is also found in a number of hydrolases, such as nicotinamidase that converts nicotinamide to nicotinic acid [79]. Members of this family are found in all filamentous ascomycetes, but interestingly they are only secreted in phytopathogens. Salicylic acid is synthesised in plants in response to pathogen attack and mediates plant defences. As isochorismate is a precursor of salicyclic acid [80], it may be worth speculating that isochorismatases secreted by fungi could act to reduce salicylic acid accumulation in response to pathogen attack and thus inhibit plant defence responses. The secreted isochorismatases (apart from one of the proteins from <span class="yellow">S. nodorum</span>) all show sequence similarity to ycaC from <span class="yellow">E. coli</span>, an octameric hydrolase of unknown function [81]. Pfam motifs found in the secretomes of at least three species of phytopathogens, but not in any of the non-pathogens also include those found in enzymes potentially involved in detoxification, such as arylesterase and amidohydrolase, and also beta-ketoacyl synthase, which catalyses the condensation of malonyl-ACP with a growing fatty acid chain and is found as a component of a number of enzyme systems, including fatty acid synthases and polyketide synthases [82], [83].
Table 9 shows a list of Pfam motifs that are more common in the secretomes of phytopathogens as compared to saprotrophs. These include a number of secreted proteases, transcription factors and components of signal transduction pathways. The Kelch domain (PF01344) shows the most striking difference in distribution between phytopathogenic and non-pathogenic genomes. This 50-residue domain is found in a number of actin-binding proteins [84], as well as enzymes such as galactose oxidase and neuraminidase. The putative function of each secreted Kelch domain-containing protein was ascertained by performing a BLAST search against the NCBI non-redundant protein database (Table 10). A number of these seem to be galactose oxidases, enzymes which catalyse the oxidation of a range of primary alcohols, including galactose, to the corresponding aldehyde with the concomitant reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) [85]. Galactose oxidase shares a copper radical oxidase motif with the hydrogen peroxide-generating glyoxal oxidases involved in lignin-degradation in <span class="yellow">Phanerochaete chrysosporium</span> [86]. H2O2-producing copper oxidases have been shown to have roles in morphogenesis, in the <span class="yellow">corn</span>-smut fungus <span class="yellow">Ustilago maydis</span> for example, a glyoxal oxidase is required for filamentous growth and pathogenicity [87] and a galactose oxidase is involved in fruiting body formation in the gram-negative bacterium <span class="yellow">Stigmatella aurantiaca</span> [88]. Interestingly, the list of Pfam motifs more common in the secretomes of phytopathogens also includes those found in copper amine oxidases, H2O2-generating enzymes that catalyse the oxidative deamination of primary amines to the corresponding aldehydes [89] and peroxidases, haem-containing enzymes that use hydrogen peroxide as the electron acceptor to catalyse a number of oxidative reactions. Secreted fungal peroxidases include enzymes involved in lignin breakdown by the white rot fungus <span class="yellow">Phanerochaete chrysosporium</span> [90], but in plants they generate reactive oxygen species and are involved in defence responses and growth induction [91]. A number of other secreted Kelch domain-containing proteins have similarity to proteins of unknown function from species of the bacterial phytopathogen Xanthomonas. Many Kelch domain-containing proteins are involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell morphology [92], [93]. It may be worth speculating that secreted Kelch domain-containing proteins could act as effectors, causing changes in the arrangement of the cytoskeleton of infected plants to aid the proliferation of fungal hyphae. It has recently been shown, for example, that <span class="yellow">M. grisea</span> co-opts plasmodesmata to move from cell to cell in infected <span class="yellow">rice</span> leaves [94] and would therefore need to peturb cytoskeletal organisation in <span class="yellow">rice</span> epidermal cells. There are other Pfam domains that are more common in the secretomes of phytopathogens that may potentially be found in effectors such as the PAN domain (PF00024), that mediates protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate interactions [95] and the F5/8 type C domain (PF00754), found in the discoidin family of proteins involved in cell-adhesion or developmental processes [96].<br><br>
Discussion
One of the most fundamental aims in plant pathology research is to define precisely the difference between pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms. The answer cannot be one of simple phylogeny, because phytopathogenic species are found in all taxonomic divisions of fungi and are often closely related to non-pathogenic species [3]. Before the availability of genomic sequences and high throughput approaches to study gene function [20], research was concentrated on the search for single pathogenicity factors; genes that are dispensable for saprophytic growth but essential for successful infection of the host plant [4], [97]. However, rather than encoding novel proteins found only in phytopathogens, the majority of pathogenicity factors discovered in this way have been found to be involved in signalling cascades and metabolic pathways and hence are conserved in most species of fungi [5]. Components of signalling cascades that in the budding <span class="yellow">yeast</span> <span class="yellow">S. cerevisiae</span> are responsible for responses to pheromones, nutritional starvation and osmotic stress [9] have in many cases evolved different roles in the life cycle of pathogens, such as controlling appressorium formation, dimorphism and growth [10]. Although the central components of signalling are conserved between phytopathogens and <span class="yellow">S. cerevisiae</span>, the receptors are often different, reflecting the different environmental cues to which the pathogen needs to respond [11], [98].
Analysis of all available genome sequences from a wider range of fungal species has for the first time allowed us to address the differences between phytopathogens and non-pathogens at a whole genome level. For this purpose, the e-Fungi data warehouse provides a means to interrogate the vast amounts of genomic and functional data available in a simple integrated manner [26]. Previous research, in which EST datasets were compared with genomic sequences, suggested that the expressed gene inventories of phytopathogenic species were not significantly more similar to one another than to those of saprotrophic filamentous fungi [99]. We clustered sets of predicted proteins from 36 different species of fungi and oomycetes into groups of potential orthologues and the species distribution of members of each cluster was ascertained. There were no clusters that were completely specific to phytopathogenic species across both fungi and oomycetes, suggesting that the presence of novel, universal pathogenicity factors in the genomes of phytopathogens is unlikely. This was confirmed by looking at clusters containing empirically defined pathogenicity factors, where homologues of many of these were found in all species studied and none were conserved in the genomes only of phytopathogens. A small number were only found in a single species of fungus and probably represented proteins that are highly specialised for a particular role in a specific pathogenic species, for example in host-plant recognition [54]. Previous research also suggested that the gene inventories of filamentous fungi were more similar to each other than to those of unicellular yeasts [99]. Analysis of the clusters of similar proteins show some clusters that are found in all species of filamentous fungi (including ascomycetes, basidiomycetes and zygomycetes) but are not present in the genomes of yeasts, consistent with the original conclusion. These contain a number of proteins that are likely to be involved in morphological changes associated with the more complex filamentous lifestyle, as well those involved in secondary metabolism and signalling cascades that are not found in yeasts. In particular, our results suggest that filamentous fungi use a wider variety of lipid molecules for the purpose of signalling. Some of these may act as pheromones, or hormones– chemical messengers diffusing from one cell to another to elicit a physiological or developmental response [37]. A number of these innovations to the filamentous lifestyle may serve important roles in pathogenesis as well, because homologues of a number of pathogenicity factors are found only in filamentous ascomycetes. The distribution of filamentous fungi-specific proteins, such as involved in those cytoskeletal rearrangements and fruiting body formation, throughout the fungal kingdom (and in some cases in oomycetes as well), suggests that the last common ancestral fungus may well have been multi-cellular and the evolution of uni-cellular fungi was likely associated with massive gene loss. For example, it has been shown that early in ascomycete evolution there was a proliferation of subtilase-type protease-encoding genes that have been retained in some filamentous ascomycete lineages, but lost in the <span class="yellow">yeast</span> lineage [100].
It has previously been speculated that the evolution of phytopathogenesis was associated with the expansion of certain gene families [1]. Duplication of an ancestral gene, followed by mutation allows members of the family to take on new functions [101]. For example, genomes of the filamentous ascomycetes studied here have between 40 and 140 cytochrome P450-encoding genes (data not shown) that are involved in toxin biosynthesis, lipid metabolism, alkane assimilation and detoxification [102] and which probably arose via gene duplication and functional diversification. In contrast, the genome of the budding <span class="yellow">yeast</span> <span class="yellow">S. cerevisiae</span> has only three cytochrome P450-encoding enzymes. We have shown here that there are likely to be large differences in the gene inventories of filamentous fungi compared to unicellular yeasts.
To study the differences between phytopathogenic and saprophytic fungi, we concentrated on the filamentous ascomycetes where there are a number of phytopathogenic species genomes have been sequenced along with closely related non-pathogens. Protein families were defined using Pfam motifs [57] and the predicted protein sets for each species analysed in order to identify domains that were specific to or more common in the genomes of phytopathogens. Not surprisingly, many of the protein families we identified are likely to be associated with pathogenic processes such as plant cell wall degradation, toxin biosynthesis, formation of reactive oxygen species and detoxification [5]. Studies of bacterial phytopathogens have shown the importance of effectors, secreted proteins that disable plant defences and subvert metabolic and morphological processes for the benefit of the invading pathogen and which require delivery via a type III secretion system that are often deployed during pathogenesis [73]. Bacterial type III secreted effectors (T3SEs) have been shown to target salicyclic acid and abscisic acid-dependent defences, host vesicle trafficking, transcription and RNA metabolism, and several components of the plant defence signalling networks [103]. Very recently, potential effector-encoding genes have been identified in the genomes of several species of oomycete pathogens and are defined by the presence of a conserved RXLR-EER motif downstream of the signal peptide sequence [74]. The RXLR-EER motif is necessary for delivery of effector proteins into host plant cells and is therefore critical to their biological activity [74].
To identify potential fungal effectors, we compared Pfam motif frequency between the secretomes of phytopathogens and non-pathogens. This analysis identified potential effector-encoding genes, including secreted proteases, transcription factors and proteins that may be involved in cytoskeletal rearrangements (such as Kelch-domain containing proteins) and protein-protein interactions, as well as a group of pathogen-specific secreted isochorisimatases that potentially could suppress salicyclic acid-dependent host plant defences. Bacterial T3SEs are injected directly into the host cytoplasm via the type III secretion injection apparatus [73]. In contrast, the potential fungal effectors identified in this study appear to be secreted by the normal cellular secretory pathway via the endoplasmic reticulum and the mechanism by which fungal effectors might be taken up by plant cells and enter into the host cytoplasm is currently unknown.
Although the evolution of phytopathogenicity is likely to have happened several times and the lifestyles of these fungi are diverse, a comparison of gene inventories of a number of species using a powerful resource, such as e-Fungi, has allowed us to pinpoint new gene families that may serve important roles in the virulence of phytopathogens, allowing their selection for gene functional studies, that are currently in progress. The analyses deployed here may also offer a blueprint for the types of larger, more comprehensive studies that will be necessary to interpret the large flow of genetic data that will result from next generation DNA sequence analysis utilizing both a much wider variety of fungal pathogen species and also large sets of individual isolates of existing species.<br><br>Materials and Methods
Clustering of sequences
Sets of predicted proteins were downloaded for each of the 36 genomes from respective sequencing project websites (Table 1). Proteins less than 40 amino acids in length were not included in this analysis. Proteins were clustered using “all against all” BLASTP [104] followed by Markov Chain Clustering (MCL) [27] with 2.5 as a moderate inflation value and 10−10 as an E-value cut-off, as described previously [28], [29]. Clusters were annotated based on best hit against Swiss-Prot protein database [105] of members of that cluster (e-value <10−20 using BLASTP), or Pfam motifs contained in proteins from the cluster in the absence of Swiss-Prot hits.<br><br>Identification of Pfam motifs
The Pfam-A library from release 18.0 of the Pfam database was downloaded from the Pfam website (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/). This library contains 7973 protein models constructed from manually curated multiple alignments and covers 75% of proteins in UniProt [44], [57]. This library was used to analyse the sequences of predicted proteins for all 36 fungal genomes to identify the Pfam motifs that each protein contains. The analysis was performed using the “pfam_scan” perl script (version 0.5) downloaded from the Pfam website and HMMER software (downloaded from http://hmmer.wustl.edu/). Default thresholds were used, which are hand-curated for every family and designed to minimise false positives [44].<br><br>Identification of secreted proteins
The N-terminal sequence of each predicted protein from the 36 fungal genomes used in this study was analysed for the presence of a signal peptide using SignalP 3.0 [75] and sub-cellular localisation was predicted using WoLF PSORT [76]. Both these programs were installed locally. SignalP 3.0 uses two different algorithms to identify signal sequences. The secretome for each fungal species was defined as containing those proteins that were predicted have a signal peptide by both prediction algorithms from SignalP 3.0 and also predicted to be extracellular by WoLF PSORT.<br><br>Data analysis
All the data produced, as described above, was stored in the e-Fungi data warehouse [26] from which it can be accessed via a web-interface (http://www.e-fungi.org.uk/). Analyses described in this study were performed using the e-Fungi database.<br><br>

<h3>pmcA1885664</h3>The recombination-associated protein RdgC adopts a novel toroidal architecture for DNA binding
Abstract
RecA plays a central role in the nonmutagenic repair of stalled replication forks in bacteria. RdgC, a recombination-associated DNA-binding protein, is a potential negative regulator of RecA function. Here, we have determined the crystal structure of RdgC from <span class="blue">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>. The J-shaped monomer has a unique fold and can be divided into three structural domains: tip domain, center domain and base domain. Two such monomers dimerize to form a ring-shaped molecule of approximate 2-fold symmetry. Of the two inter-subunit interfaces within the dimer, one interface (‘interface A’) between tip/center domains is more nonpolar than the other (‘interface B’) between base domains. The structure allows us to propose that the RdgC dimer binds dsDNA through the central hole of ∼30 Å diameter. The proposed model is supported by our DNA-binding assays coupled with mutagenesis, which indicate that the conserved positively charged residues on the protein surface around the central hole play important roles in DNA binding. The novel ring-shaped architecture of the RdgC dimer has significant implications for its role in homologous recombination.<br><br>INTRODUCTION
Homologous recombination systems contribute to the maintenance of genome integrity and are essential for the repair of stalled replication forks (1). Genetic studies of the recombination-dependent growth C (rdgC) gene in bacterial systems have suggested that it is involved in DNA replication and recombination (2,3). In <span class="yellow">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</span> (the gonococcus), RdgC is required for efficient pilin antigenic variation and plays some role in cell growth (4,5). The <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span> rdgC gene encodes a DNA-binding protein of 34 kDa, whose expression level was at its highest during exponential phase, reaching its maximum at ∼1000 dimers per cell (2). Its level decreased sharply to ∼50 dimers per cell in stationary phase. This profile suggests that RdgC might function during the period of DNA replication (2).
The RecA proteins and their homologs play a key role in recombinational DNA repair in bacteria and eukaryotes. Their aberrant reactions could result in gross chromosomal rearrangements that lead to <span class="yellow">human</span> diseases, including cancer. Therefore, their functions must be tightly regulated, and understanding how the RecA family of recombinases is regulated is of utmost importance (1). The <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> RdgC protein is a potential negative regulator of the function of RecA (1). It inhibits RecA-promoted DNA strand exchange, RecA-mediated ATPase activity and RecA-dependent LexA cleavage (1). Sedimentation equilibrium data indicated that <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> RdgC exists in solution as a mixture of oligomeric states in equilibrium, most likely monomers, dimers and tetramers (1). This concentration-dependent change in the oligomeric state appears to affect its mode of binding to DNA and its capacity to inhibit RecA (1). The primary mechanism of RdgC inhibition appears to involve a simple competition for DNA-binding sites, especially on double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) (1).
Deletion of the <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> rdgC gene alone causes no obvious phenotype but is highly deleterious in strains lacking certain enzymes involved in recombination and replication restart (2,3). RdgC is essential for the growth of an <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> strain lacking PriA, indicating that it might affect replication fork progression or fork rescue (2). PriA provides a means to load the DnaB replicative helicase at DNA replication fork and D loop structures (2). RdgC is, therefore, a key factor in the rescue of stalled or broken forks and subsequent replication restart. dnaC suppressors of PriA can overcome this inviability, especially when RecF, RecO or RecR is inactivated, which indicates that RdgC avoids or counters the toxic effect of these proteins by limiting inappropriate RecA loading on SSB-coated ssDNA (2).
The DNA-binding ability of the RdgC protein has been demonstrated clearly using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (2). <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span> RdgC binds non-specifically to dsDNA and with higher affinity than ssDNA (2). RdgC from <span class="yellow">N. meningitidis</span> also binds DNA with little specificity for sequence or structure, like the <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> protein (4). RdgC exhibits no preference for DNA replication or recombination intermediates (2). However, no detectable domains or nuclease activity could be identified for the <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> RdgC protein (2,6). The complexes of <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> RdgC with both linear and supercoiled circular plasmid DNA were imaged using atomic force microscopy (7). RdgC was found to have an increased affinity to DNA ends and to promote bending of DNA (7). RdgC has the effect on DNA superstructure; the promotion of DNA condensation was observed at high protein concentrations (7). Recombination is largely enhanced by close contacts of distant regions along the DNA strands through condensation (7).
<span class="blue">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> is a ubiquitous environmental Gram-negative bacterium that belongs to the γ subdivision of the Proteobacteria. Orthologs of the rdgC gene are found only in β and γ subdivisions of the Proteobacteria (2). The amino acid sequence of <span class="yellow">P. aeruginosa</span> RdgC, a 306-residue protein, shows 46 and 36% identities against those of <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> and <span class="yellow">N. meningitidis</span>, respectively. Despite the importance of DNA-binding ability of RdgC in its biological roles, the structural details of RdgC and the mechanism of its action remain unclear. Here, we report the crystal structure of <span class="yellow">P. aeruginosa</span> RdgC as determined by the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method of X-ray crystallography. It reveals that RdgC dimer is ring-shaped, with a central hole of ∼30 Å diameter. The inside surface around the central hole is rich in conserved, positively charged residues, which are implicated in DNA-binding by mutagenesis. We propose that dsDNA binds to RdgC through this central hole. Our structure provides a solid structural framework for a better understanding of the role of RdgC in homologous recombination.<br><br>MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein expression and purification
The rdgC gene (PA3263) was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the genomic DNA of <span class="yellow">P. aeruginosa</span> strain PAO1 as a template. The oligonucleotide primers designed using the published genome sequence (8) were 5′-G GAA TTC CAT ATG TGG TTC CGC AAT CTG CTC G-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCG CCG CTC GAG GAC GCC CTG GGG GAT TTC TTC-3′ (reverse). The bases in bold denote the NdeI and XhoI cleavage sites, respectively. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and XhoI, and was then inserted into the NdeI/XhoI-digested expression vector pET-21a(+) (Novagen). This vector construction adds an eight-residue tag (LEHHHHHH) to the carboxyl terminus of the gene product to facilitate protein purification.
The protein was expressed in <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> C41 (DE3) cells (9). The cells were grown at 37°C up to OD600 of 0.6 in Luria–Bertani medium that contained 50 μg ml−1 ampicillin, and the protein expression was induced by 0.5 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The cells were allowed to grow at 20°C for 22 h after IPTG induction and were harvested by centrifugation at 4200 g (6000 rev min−1; Sorvall GSA rotor) for 10 min at 4°C. The cell pellet was resuspended in an ice-cold lysis buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 500 mM sodium chloride, 5 mM imidazole] and was then homogenized with an ultrasonic processor. The crude cell extract was centrifuged at 36 000 g (18 000 rev min−1; Hanil Supra 21 K rotor) for 60 min at 4°C, and the recombinant protein in the supernatant fraction was purified in three chromatographic steps.
The first purification step utilized the C-terminal hexahistidine-tag by Ni2+-chelated HiTrap chelating column (GE Healthcare). The eluent was diluted 3-fold with 50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.4. The diluted solution was applied to a 20-ml heparin-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare), which was previously equilibrated with a buffer of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM dithiothreitol and 1 mM EDTA. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–2.0 M sodium chloride in the same buffer. The first peak corresponded to high molecular aggregates of RdgC and the second peak to RdgC dimers, which was also consistent with our dynamic light scattering measurements. When the aggregates were not separated from the dimers, the protein readily aggregated within a day. The dimer fractions were concentrated to ∼6 mg ml−1 concentration using an YM10 ultrafiltration membrane (Millipore-Amicon) and further purified by gel filtration on a HiLoad XK 16 Superdex 200 prep-grade column (GE Healthcare), which was previously equilibrated with a buffer of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 1 mM EDTA. The first peak corresponding to the high molecular aggregates of RdgC was only a minor component, and the second peak corresponding to RdgC dimers was stable for several weeks when frozen at −70°C. The procedure for purifying the SeMet-substituted protein was the same, except for the presence of 10 mM dithiothreitol in all buffers used during purification steps. Dynamic light scattering experiments were performed at 24°C, with the protein (at 2 mg ml−1 concentration) dissolved in a buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA and 200 mM sodium chloride on a Model DynaPro-801 instrument (Wyatt, Santa Barbara, CA, USA). The protein concentration was estimated by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm, employing the calculated extinction coefficient of 20 910 M−1 cm−1 (SWISS-PROT; http://www.expasy.ch/).<br><br>Mutagenesis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay
Point mutants were prepared using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The seven mutants R4A, F120A, K146A, R198A, R208A, Q212A and R252A were well expressed and soluble. The three mutants K70A, R81A and R211A were not expressed, while R122A mutant was expressed but was not soluble. Therefore, we mutated Lys70, Arg81, Arg122 and Arg211 into aspartate. The K70D, R81D, R122D and R211D mutants were well expressed and soluble. The soluble mutants were expressed and purified under the conditions identical to those for the wild type, except that the heparin-Sepharose column step was omitted. All of the soluble mutants had similar elution profiles as the wild type upon gel filtration, and the dimer fractions were used for DNA-binding assays. We mixed 5 μl of RdgC (1.1 μg μl−1) and 5 μl of a linear dsDNA with 414 bp (63 ng μl−1), corresponding to the molar ratio of 64:1 for RdgC dimer to dsDNA. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 10 min at room temperature. RdgC–DNA complexes were analyzed by 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis in 1× TAE buffer (45 mM Tris-acetate at pH 8.3, 1 mM EDTA). DNA bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. For DNA-binding assays, the protein concentration was measured with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit.<br><br>Crystallization and X-ray data collection
Crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 24°C by mixing equal volumes (2 μl each) of the protein solution (at 19 mg ml−1 concentration in a buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA and 200 mM sodium chloride) and the reservoir solution. To grow the native crystals, we used a reservoir solution consisting of 0.1 M sodium HEPES (pH 7.5), 1.0 M tri-sodium citrate and 1% (w/v) Anapoe®35 as the detergent. Native crystals grew to approximate dimensions of 0.2 mm × 0.1 mm × 0.1 mm within a few days. The SeMet-substituted protein was crystallized under conditions identical to those for the native crystals except for the presence of 10 mM dithiothreitol in the protein solution.
A crystal of the SeMet-substituted protein was dipped into a cryoprotectant solution for a few seconds and was flash-cooled in the cold nitrogen gas stream at 100 K. The cryoprotectant solution consisted of 0.1 M sodium HEPES (pH 7.5), 1.0 M tri-sodium citrate, 1% (w/v) Anapoe®35 as the detergent and 10% (v/v) glycerol. A set of Se MAD data was collected at 100 K at three different wavelengths using an Area Detector System Corporation Quantum 210 charge-coupled device detector at the beamline NW12A of Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan. The crystal was rotated through a total of 180° with a 1° oscillation range per frame. The raw data were processed and scaled using the program suit HKL2000 (10). The SeMet-substituted crystal belongs to the space group P21212, with unit cell parameters of a = 87.04 Å, b = 115.60 Å and c = 76.07 Å.
The native crystals were soaked for 10 min in 10 mM ethyl mercury thiosalicylate (EMTS) to collect a set of Hg MAD data at four different wavelengths. X-ray diffraction data from the EMTS-derivatized crystal, as well as a native crystal, were collected on a Bruker charge-coupled device detector at the beamline BL-6B of Pohang Light Source, Pohang, Korea. The EMTS-soaked crystal belongs to the space group P21212, with unit cell parameters of a = 87.16 Å, b = 116.02 Å and c = 74.97 Å. The native crystal belongs to the space group P21212, with unit cell parameters of a = 87.49 Å, b = 116.04 Å and c = 76.03 Å. If the presence of a dimeric molecule in the asymmetric unit is assumed, the calculated crystal volume per protein mass (VM) is 2.75 Å3 Da−1 and the solvent content is 55.3%. Supplementary Table 1 summarizes the statistics of X-ray diffraction data collection.<br><br>Structure solution and refinement
Heavy atom sites were located with the program SOLVE (11). Four Se sites from the SeMet-substituted crystal and two Hg sites from the EMTS-soaked crystal were located. Two sets of the initial Se and Hg MAD phases were separately improved using the program RESOLVE (12). Two electron density maps were independently interpreted, and the fragments of the two models were combined into a single model, since the two maps were complementary to each other. Non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) matrices were found from a partial model built from the initial electron density map, and phases were further improved by the 2-fold NCS averaging, solvent flattening and histogram matching with the program DM (13). The model was built with O (14). The model was refined with the program CNS (15), including the bulk solvent correction. 10% of the data were randomly set aside as the test data for the calculation of Rfree (16). Several rounds of model building, simulated annealing, positional refinement and individual B-factor refinement were performed. Subsequently, this model was used to refine the structure of the native protein. The model has excellent stereochemistry, as evaluated by the program PROCHECK (17). Refinement statistics are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.<br><br>
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Model quality and monomer structure
The structure of <span class="yellow">P. aeruginosa</span> RdgC was solved using two sets of MAD data collected from a crystal of the selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted protein and from a mercury derivative crystal of the native protein (Supplementary Table 1). The model has subsequently been refined using the 20.0–2.50 Å data from a native crystal to crystallographic Rwork and Rfree values of 23.4 and 27.9%, respectively, with no sigma cut-off. The refined model contains 612 residues of the two monomers in the asymmetric unit of the crystal (residues 1–306 for both chains A and B) and 87 water molecules. The C-terminal eight-residue fusion tag has no electron density in both subunits and has not been modeled. Conformations of the two monomers in the asymmetric unit are similar. The root-mean-square (r.m.s.) difference between the two monomers is 0.69 Å for 306 Cα atom pairs, with a maximum deviation of 8.8 Å for the Cα atom of Gly305. The residues giving r.m.s. differences larger than 2.0 Å are 14–16, 94–96, 201–202 and 303–306, which correspond to loops connecting secondary structure elements or the C-terminus. They are located on the surface of the dimer. Subunit A has a better map quality than subunit B, and thus has a lower mean B-factor than subunit B (40.3 Å2 versus. 56.1 Å2 for all 4788 atoms) (Supplementary Figure 1). Therefore, subunit A is chosen for discussions, unless otherwise stated.
The <span class="yellow">P. aeruginosa</span> RdgC monomer is J-shaped and has approximate dimensions of 72 Å × 60 Å × 40 Å (Figure 1). It can be divided into three structural domains: center domain, tip domain and base domain. Center domain (residues 1–73 and 121–167) includes a six-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet with two flanking α helices (α1 and α4). The helix α1 runs nearly parallel to the two outermost strands β2 and β3, which in turn lie adjacent to β4. Strands β2 and β3 are separated by a loop. The helix α4 is nearly orthogonal to the β-strands. Tip domain (residues 74–120) contains two α helices (α2 and α3) and is inserted between strands β4 and β5 of the center domain. It sticks out from the center domain. The two connections between the center domain and the tip domain are rich in conserved residues, hinting at an important functional role of these joints. They could act as a hinge for a possible conformational change. The C-terminal region of the polypeptide chain is folded into the base domain (residues 168–306), which consists of a five-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet with four α-helices, three of which (α5, α6 and α8) cover one side of the β-sheet. The long helix α8 is slightly bent.<br><br>
Structural similarity searches
When we searched for structural similarity against the Protein Data Bank database using the program DALI (18), the <span class="yellow">P. aeruginosa</span> RdgC monomer showed no significant similarity with a Z score above 5. Therefore, we conclude that the overall fold of the RdgC polypeptide chain is unique. When we elaborated the structural comparisons with individual domains of <span class="yellow">P. aeruginosa</span> RdgC, only the center domain gave a Z score above 5.
Using the center domain (residues 1–73 and 121–167) alone, the highest structural similarity is found with the <span class="yellow">human</span> β2-adaptin appendage domain (PDB code 1E42, Z score = 7.1, r.m.s. deviation = 2.5 Å for 85 structurally aligned residues, residues 1–12, 14–30, 44–47, 58–72, 122–133 and 135–160 of <span class="yellow">P. aeruginosa</span> RdgC chain A and residues 838–841, 848–880, 885–906 and 912–967 of the <span class="yellow">human</span> β2-adaptin appendage domain chain A) (19). There does not appear to be any functional relatedness between these two proteins. The next highest similarity is found with the <span class="yellow">yeast</span> TATA-box-binding protein (PDB code 1YTB, Z score = 5.7, r.m.s. deviation = 2.6 Å for 79 structurally aligned residues, residues 4–12, 14–19, 21–27, 56–70, 124–132 and 134–166 of <span class="yellow">P. aeruginosa</span> RdgC chain A and residues 69–96, 100–126 and 132–155 of TATA-box-binding protein, N-terminal half of chain A) (20). The TATA-box-binding protein is composed of a ten-stranded antiparallel β-sheet with four flanking α-helices on the convex side of the β-sheet (20). It has an internal quasi 2-fold symmetry, and its β-strands are involved in DNA binding. There is, however, no structural similarity of functional significance, because the two center domains of the RdgC dimer are well separated and do not associate into a single unit (Figure 1C and D).
Using the tip domain (residues 74–120) alone, the ATPase domain of <span class="yellow">bovine</span> Hsc70 chaperone shows highest structural similarity (PDB code 1BA1, Z score = 4.8, r.m.s. deviation = 1.7 Å for 45 structurally aligned residues, residues 76–120 of <span class="yellow">P. aeruginosa</span> RdgC chain A and residues 230–253 and 256–276 of the Hsc70 ATPase domain) (21). There does not seem to be any significant functional relationship between these two proteins. The α-helix-loop-α-helix structure of the tip domain is reminiscent of the helix–hairpin–helix (HhH) DNA-binding motif that is present in a number of DNA repair enzymes (22–25). The HhH motifs are characterized by the conserved sequence motif hxxhxGhGxxxAxxxhh, where h is any hydrophobic residue (VILMWFYA) and x any residue (23). Two conserved glycines allow a tight turn between two α-helices. However, the tip domain of <span class="yellow">P. aeruginosa</span> RdgC protein does not have such a sequence motif, and the loop in the RdgC tip domain is much more extended than that of the HhH motifs. Therefore, the RdgC tip domain is uniquely folded.
With the base domain (residues 168–306) alone, the highest similarity is found with <span class="yellow">P. aeruginosa</span> isochorismate-pyruvate lyase (unpublished deposition; PDB code 2H9C, Z score = 4.0, r.m.s. deviation = 4.8 Å for 51 structurally aligned residues, residues 186–191, 237–240, 257–272 and 274–298 of <span class="yellow">P. aeruginosa</span> RdgC chain A and residues 36–41, 50–53, 55–66 and 68–96 of <span class="yellow">P. aeruginosa</span> isochorismate-pyruvate lyase chain A). There does not appear to be any functional relationship between the two proteins, and the base domain of RdgC is uniquely folded. The 101-residue chain of <span class="yellow">P. aeruginosa</span> isochorismate-pyruvate lyase is folded into three α-helices, two of which overlap with two α-helices (α2 and α3) of the base domain of RdgC.<br><br>Ring-shaped dimer structure and inter-subunit interface
Our structure reveals that <span class="yellow">P. aeruginosa</span> RdgC forms a ring-shaped dimer of approximate 2-fold symmetry in the crystal (Figure 1). This observation is consistent with the results of previous gel filtration and sedimentation equilibrium experiments, which suggested the presence of dimeric species of <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> RdgC in solution (1,2). Depending on the concentration, RdgC could also exist in solution as monomers, tetramers and higher oligomers (1). In the crystal lattice, no monomeric, trimeric or tetrameric species exist. Our structure unequivocally rules out the monomer–trimer model, which fits the sedimentation equilibrium data approximately, as well as the monomer–dimer–tetramer model (1). The RdgC dimer has approximate dimensions of 80 Å × 60 Å × 40 Å, with a central hole of ∼30 Å diameter.
Only a moderate amount of surface area is buried upon the formation of the RdgC dimer. The monomer–monomer interface buries a solvent-accessible surface area of ∼1360 Å2 per monomer, corresponding to ∼8% of the total surface area of the monomer (Protein–Protein Interaction Server at http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/PP/server/). Polar and nonpolar atoms in interface are 44 and 56%, respectively. The interface can be divided into two kinds: ‘interface A’ involving both the tip domains and center domains, and ‘interface B’ involving the base domains (Figure 2A). These two interfaces have significantly different characters.<br><br>The interface A is formed largely by the crossing over of the two tip domains in the dimer (Figure 1). This interface covers a surface area of ∼565 Å2 and is largely nonpolar, with the polar and nonpolar atoms in the interface being 37.5 and 2.5%, respectively. Phe120 contributes considerably to the nonpolar character of the interface between the tip domains, accounting for ∼150 Å2 of the interface area. Phe120 is part of a highly conserved sequence segment and lies at the boundary between the tip domain and the center domain. The aromatic ring of Phe120′ inserts into a hydrophobic pocket, which is formed by the hydrophobic residues Ile74, Leu75, Pro76, Val79, Leu115, Ala119 and Phe120 of the neighboring monomer (Figure 2B). The primed residue belongs to the adjacent subunit. These residues are well conserved in the RdgC family (indicated by green triangles below the aligned sequences in Figure 3). As these hydrophobic residues are located near the molecular 2-fold axis, the two clusters of hydrophobic side chains are merged into a single, large cluster in the dimer (Figure 2B). Of the 16 hydrogen bonds that exist between the two subunits, only one is made in this interface between Arg118 and Arg118′.<br><br>The interface B is contributed to exclusively by the two base domains. This interface covers a surface area of ∼795 Å2. The polar and nonpolar atoms in this interface are 50% each. The two β-sheets of the two base domains merge into a single ten-stranded antiparallel β-sheet in this interface (Figure 2A). Thus, 15 of 16 inter-subunit hydrogen bonds are clustered in this interface. The hydrogen bond networks can be divided into two types. The first type involves the main chain atoms of Val206, Arg208 and Lys210 in strand β9; this strand associates with the equivalent strand from the other subunit in an antiparallel manner (Figure 2C). The other type involves both the side chain and main chain atoms. The side chain of Arg211′ interacts with the backbone of Gly204, while the side chain of Lys227 hydrogen bonds to those of both Gln212′ and Glu218 (Figure 2D). In addition, the side chain of Gln212′ interacts with that of Asp199 and the backbone of Arg211′ (Figure 2D). Arg211, Gln212, Glu218 and Lys227 are highly conserved among the RdgC family members. The residues participating in the hydrogen bond networks are indicated by red circles below the aligned sequences in Figure 3. The observation that conserved residues play important roles in forming the dimer implies that dimerization of RdgC is critical for its function.
If one or both of interfaces A and B are to be broken for functional reasons such as for allowing dsDNA to enter into the central hole of the RdgC dimer, we can conceive of three scenarios. The first possibility would be a simultaneous breakage of the two interfaces A and B. The second would be the sequential disruption of the interfaces A and B. The third would be the disruption of only one of the two interfaces A and B. Sedimentation equilibrium indicated the presence of monomers in solution (1), which is consistent with the first two scenarios. If the third scenario holds, RdgC dimers could possibly exist in two conformations in solution, i.e. a closed form as observed in the present crystal structure, and an open form, in which one of the two interfaces A and B is broken.<br><br>A model for DNA binding by RdgC and DNA-binding assay
The net charge of <span class="yellow">P. aeruginosa</span> RdgC is highly negative, since each monomer contains 12 aspartate, 13 glutamate, 10 lysine, 9 arginine and 2 histidine residues. The net charge of a dimer would be −12 (or −8), if we assume none (or all) of histidines to be positively charged. The electrostatic potential at the molecular surface of RdgC dimer shows that the charge distribution on the protein surface is highly nonuniform (Figure 4A). Since the inner surface of the RdgC dimer is rich in conserved, positively charged residues and the diameter of the central hole (∼30 Å) is approximately similar to that of other toroidal DNA-binding proteins (26), it appears likely that RdgC dimers bind dsDNA through the central hole. Despite extensive co-crystallization and soaking trials with linear dsDNAs of different lengths (14-mer, 16-mer and 18-mer), we could not locate the bound DNA experimentally. We attribute this difficulty to the nature of sequence-nonspecific DNA binding by RdgC. Therefore, we built a crude model of a DNA complex of the RdgC dimer by fitting dsDNA into the central hole (Figure 4B). This model is supported by the DNA-binding assays coupled with mutagenesis, as described below. It is also consistent with the suggested binding site size of ∼16 nt for the <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> RdgC dimer (1) and the approximate thickness (∼40 Å) of the <span class="yellow">P. aeruginosa</span> RdgC dimer.<br><br>When we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay for dsDNA binding, <span class="yellow">P. aeruginosa</span> RdgC did not require Mg2+ ions (Supplementary Figure 2), unlike <span class="yellow">Deinococcus radiodurans</span> RecR, which required high concentrations of Mg2+ ions (27). ATP was not required for dsDNA binding by <span class="yellow">P. aeruginosa</span> RdgC, either (Supplementary Figure 2). This is consistent with an apparent lack of an ATP-binding pocket in the RdgC dimer structure.
In order to identify the residues that are important for dsDNA binding, we carried out mutational analyses. The residues for mutagenesis were selected on the basis of the modeled complex between RdgC dimer and dsDNA, together with sequence conservation (Figure 4C). We prepared eleven point mutants (R4A, K70D, R81D, F120A, R122D, K146A, R198A, R208A, R211D, Q212A and R252A). These eleven mutated residues are well conserved among RdgC proteins. Eight mutants (R4A, K70D, R81D, R122D, K146A, R198A, R208A and R252A) had a lower affinity for dsDNA than the wild-type RdgC (Figure 4D). These eight mutated residues are indicated by blue squares below the aligned sequences in Figure 3. This result indicates that dsDNA binds to the inside surface around the central hole of the RdgC dimer, since the mutated residues are located on the inner surface of the RdgC dimer. It is worth mentioning that a single mutation introduces two alterations per RdgC dimer.
The three mutants (F120A, R211D and Q212A) were prepared to investigate whether dimerization of RdgC is crucial for dsDNA binding. Phe120 is a key residue located in the inter-subunit interface A (Figure 2B), while Arg211 makes hydrogen bonds in the interface B (Figure 2D) and Gln212 is involved in both intra- and inter-subunit interactions (Figure 2D). dsDNA binding by the F120A mutant is considerably weakened, compared to either the R211D or Q212A mutant (Figure 4D). This result suggests that destabilization of the ring-shaped architecture of the RdgC dimer is deleterious for tight dsDNA binding and that interface A is probably more important than interface B for dsDNA binding. dsDNA-binding affinity of the Q212A mutant was lower than the wild type (Figure 4D), whereas that of the R211D mutant was comparable to the wild type (Figure 4D). This result suggests that disruption of the inter-subunit interface B is also detrimental for dsDNA binding but to a smaller extent than disruption of the interface A. It further suggests that the side chain of Arg211 is not involved in recognizing dsDNA. It is interesting that the DNA complex for wild type forms a distinct band (lane 3 in Figure 4D), as opposed to a more diffuse band as one would expect if the complexes contained different numbers of RdgC dimers. Assuming a binding site size of ∼16 nt (1), the 414-bp duplex DNA would bind ∼25 RdgC dimers if it is fully saturated.<br><br>RdgC is unique among ring-shaped DNA-binding proteins
<span class="blue">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> RdgC adds a unique member to the repertoire of toroidal DNA-binding proteins (26) such as <span class="yellow">D. radiodurans</span> RecR (27) and DNA polymerase processivity factors, including the β subunit of <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> DNA polymerase III (28), gp45 of T4 DNA polymerase (29) and PCNA of eukaryotic DNA polymerase δ (30,31) (Figure 5). These proteins do not have an overall sequence similarity among themselves, and their quaternary structures also vary. <span class="yellow">P. aeruginosa</span> RdgC and <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> β clamp are homodimers, T4 gp45 and eukaryotic PCNAs are homotrimers and <span class="yellow">D. radiodurans</span> RecR is a homotetramer.<br><br>In <span class="yellow">P. aeruginosa</span> RdgC, the inner surface of the ring-shaped dimer is largely formed by β-strands, while the outer surface of the ring is mostly formed by α-helices (Figure 5). The predicted DNA-binding site of <span class="yellow">P. aeruginosa</span> RdgC dimer is primarily formed by β-strands and loops. In contrast, in other ring-shaped DNA-binding proteins such as the β subunit of <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> DNA polymerase III (28), gp45 of T4 DNA polymerase (29), PCNA of eukaryotic DNA polymerases δ (30,31) and <span class="yellow">D. radiodurans</span> RecR (27), α-helices are located toward the center of the ring and are surrounded by β-strands in the outermost side of the ring (Figure 5). Despite a superficial resemblance of the overall ring-shaped architecture of the RdgC dimer with those of other toroidal DNA-binding proteins, the internal arrangement of the secondary structure elements in the RdgC dimer is strikingly different from those of other toroidal DNA-binding proteins. Thus, RdgC is unique among ring-shaped DNA-binding proteins.
A number of other proteins involved in DNA metabolism also adopt a ring-shaped structure despite diversity in the molecular functions (26). They include NAD+-dependent DNA ligase (25), λ exonuclease (32), hexameric helicases, topoisomerases, the trp RNA-binding attenuation protein, the <span class="yellow">bacteriophage</span> head-to-tail connector and translin (26). There are also many examples of the proteins in DNA recombination pathways that assemble into multi-subunit toroids containing a central channel (26). Electron microscopy showed that the <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> RuvB protein, in the presence of ATP, forms a dodecamer on double-stranded DNA in which two stacked hexameric rings encircle the DNA and are oriented in opposite directions with D6 symmetry (33). The <span class="yellow">human</span> RAD52 protein was found to assemble into heptameric rings with a large funnel-shaped channel, 40–60 Å in diameter (34). The <span class="yellow">human</span> DMC1 protein has so far been detected only as an octameric ring (35).<br><br>Inhibition mechanism of RecA function by RdgC
RdgC inhibits RecA-promoted DNA strand exchange, RecA-mediated ATPase activity and RecA-dependent LexA cleavage (1). It was observed that the effects of RdgC on RecA-promoted DNA strand exchange were much more pronounced than the effects of RdgC on other RecA functions, when RdgC was added to the reaction late (1). By examining the effects of the DinI protein on RdgC-mediated inhibition of RecA activities, it was concluded that the potent effect of RdgC in the inhibition of strand exchange did not primarily reflect a displacement of RecA in the nucleoprotein filament by RdgC, but instead a binding of RdgC to the dsDNA substrate so as to make it unavailable to the filaments for strand exchange (1).
Our work contributes to a better understanding of the inhibition mechanism of RecA function by RdgC. The ring-shaped architecture with a central hole that is suitable for the binding of dsDNA lends RdgC with a capacity to hold dsDNA very tightly. Therefore, we suggest that RdgC dimers probably function as a tight dsDNA gripper and physically block access to the target dsDNA by RecA filaments, because tight encircling of dsDNA by RdgC dimers, possibly as a linear aggregate, would prevent the two strands from dissociating. However, it remains unclear how the closed-ring structure of the RdgC dimer might allow binding of a large number of RdgC dimers on the duplex DNA. It may be conceivable that each RdgC dimer can open temporarily at one or both of its two inter-subunit interfaces so that dsDNA can enter the central hole.
RdgC was at its highest level during exponential phase, reaching its maximum of ∼1000 dimers per <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> cell. Its level decreased sharply to ∼50 dimers per cell in stationary phase (2). Under normal cellular conditions, RecA is maintained at ∼1000 molecules per cell (http://www.els.net/). Following LexA repressor cleavage, the level of RecA protein in the cell increases by as much as 20-fold. RdgC inhibition of the RecA function by a simple competition mechanism at the cellular concentration of RdgC clearly requires a much higher affinity for DNA by RdgC than RecA. Possible protein–protein interactions between RdgC dimers might have a profound effect on the affinity for DNA, when a large number of RdgC dimers are bound on a duplex DNA. If only one of the two inter-subunit interfaces can open up and the 2-fold symmetry axes of the RdgC dimers are misaligned sufficiently, the escape of DNA from a linear array of interacting RdgC dimers would be extremely difficult. Alternatively, both inter-subunit interfaces of each dimer may open up simultaneously. A line of indirect evidence for the possible protein–protein interactions between RdgC dimers is provided by the cooperative binding of RdgC to DNA (7). Cooperativity of RdgC binding may be caused by local and distant protein–protein interactions (7). A kind of side-by-side interaction between two adjacent molecules of RdgC dimer is present in the crystal, burying an accessible surface area of ∼750 Å2 at the interface. The interaction involves mostly the less polar side surface of the dimer (left side of Figure 4A), with 2-fold symmetry axes of the two interacting RdgC molecules making an angle of ∼90° when viewed down the central holes and ∼15° when viewed perpendicular to the holes. This may explain the observed DNA bending by RdgC, which was speculated to be a necessary step in the working mechanism of RdgC, if one can assume that the strong protein–protein interactions in the crystal were relevant for protein–protein interactions in solution (7).
RdgC protein was shown to have a potent effect on RecA protein-promoted DNA strand exchange in <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> (1). In a series of experiments, RdgC was added after RecA filaments had formed on the ssDNA and 5 min after the linear dsDNA was added. With 3 μM RecA, a sharp reduction in DNA strand exchange products was seen with 0.4 μM RdgC, and the generation of products was abolished at 0.8 μM RdgC (1). This suggests that the binding affinity of RdgC to dsDNA is considerably higher than that of RecA. The high affinity of RdgC could be explained by its ring shape and the suggested mode of DNA binding. Tetrameric species of <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> RdgC, which started to form at around 2 µM concentrations, were speculated to be the species with the most potent inhibitory effect, possibly by having a higher affinity for DNA (1). Higher affinity for DNA of the tetrameric species could be understood, if the formation of a tetramer in solution involves a protein–protein interaction similar to the side-by-side interaction between two adjacent RdgC dimers in the crystal, although there is no experimental evidence. Obviously, there are still many open questions that need to be addressed in future biochemical experiments.<br><br>
SUMMARY
The crystal structure of RdgC, a recombination-associated DNA-binding protein, determined in this study reveals that the polypeptide chain is uniquely folded and two monomers associate to form a ring-shaped dimer with a central hole of ∼30 Å diameter. The inner surface around the central hole is rich in positively charged residues. These structural features suggest that dsDNA runs through the central hole when it binds to RdgC dimers. This idea is supported by our mutational studies, which indicate that the conserved, positively charged residues around the central hole are important for dsDNA binding. The toroidal architecture of the RdgC dimer provides a sound framework for a better understanding of its role in homologous recombination.
