Abstract
Scp160p is a 160 kDa protein in the <span class="yellow">yeast</span> <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> that contains 14 repeats of the hnRNP K-homology (KH) domain, and demonstrates significant sequence homology to a family of proteins collectively known as vigilins. As a first step towards defining the function of Scp160p, we have characterized the subcellular distribution and in vivo interactions of this protein. Using sucrose gradient fractionation studies we have demonstrated that Scp160p in cytoplasmic lysates is predominantly associated with polyribosomes. Furthermore, we have found that Scp160p is released from polyribosomes by EDTA in the form of a large complex of ≥1300 kDa that is sensitive both to RNase and NaCl. Using affinity-chromatography to isolate these complexes, we have identified two protein components other than Scp160p: poly(A) binding protein, Pab1p, and Bfr1p. The presence of Pab1p confirms these complexes to be mRNPs. The presence of Bfr1p is intriguing because the null phenotype for this gene is essentially the same as that reported for scp160-null cells: increased cell size and aberrant DNA content. These results demonstrate that Scp160p associates with polyribosome-bound mRNP complexes in vivo, implicating a role for this protein in one or more levels of mRNA metabolism in <span class="yellow">yeast</span>.<br><br>INTRODUCTION
Scp160p is a 1222 amino acid <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> protein that contains 14 copies of the hnRNP K homology (KH) domain, a highly conserved motif found in many proteins involved in RNA metabolism (1). KH domain-containing proteins appear to have diverse functions and have been identified in all kingdoms of life, including the ribosomal protein S3 from <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span> (1), Mer1p from <span class="yellow">S.cerevisiae</span>, a meiosis-specific splicing factor (1), MEX-3 from <span class="yellow">Caenorhabditis elegans</span>, presumably involved in mRNA localization during development (2), and FMRP, the fragile-X mental retardation protein in <span class="yellow">humans</span> (3). A partial clone of Scp160p, known as HX, was one of the first multiple-KH proteins identified (1).
Whole cell immunofluorescence studies have demonstrated that Scp160p localizes to the cytoplasm, with enrichment around the nuclear envelope, and what appears to be the endoplasmic reticulum (3). Deletion of the SCP160 locus in <span class="yellow">yeast</span> is not lethal, but results in a complex phenotype, including increased DNA content per cell, missegregation of genetic markers during sporulation, and abnormal cell morphology, including increased size and irregular shape (4). Observation of this phenotype led to the hypothesis that Scp160p may function in regulating ploidy during cell division. More recently, Weber and colleagues demonstrated in vitro RNA binding activity of Scp160p using northwestern blot analyses; the protein was found to bind efficiently to ribohomopolymers and rRNA, but not to tRNA (5). Cell fractionation studies revealed that a large percentage of Scp160p associates with membrane-pellets, and is released by treatment with either 10 mM EDTA or 500 mM NaCl (5). While these authors interpreted these results to suggest that the nuclear envelope/ER localization of Scp160p was due primarily to interactions of the protein with membrane-bound polyribosomes, clear evidence of this association has not been reported (5). Currently, the relationship between the phenotype of scp160 null mutants and the RNA-binding activity of Scp160p remains unclear.
Scp160p demonstrates significant sequence homology (~23% identity and ~40% similarity at the amino acid level) to a class of vertebrate KH-domain proteins collectively known as vigilins. First identified in <span class="yellow">chicken</span>, vigilin homologues have now been found in <span class="yellow">human</span> (6), <span class="yellow">Xenopus laevis</span> (7), <span class="yellow">Drosophila melanogaster</span> (8), <span class="yellow">C.elegans</span> (5) and <span class="yellow">Schizosaccharomyces pombe</span>. While all of the vigilin proteins studied to date are reported to bind nucleic acid, both the type of nucleic acid bound and the functional significance of these interactions remain unclear. For example, Kruse and colleagues reported from their work with <span class="yellow">human</span> cells in culture that vigilin may be involved in the binding and transport of tRNA (9–11). In contrast, Dodson and Shapiro concluded from their work with Xenopus vigilin that, in response to estrogen, the protein bound specifically to the 3′ UTR of vitellogenin mRNA (7,12), potentially stabilizing the message (13). Lastly, DDP1, the <span class="red">Drosophila</span> homolog of vigilin, was reported recently to interact with the dodeca-satellite repeat regions of centromeric heterochromatin in embryonic and larval cell nuclei, suggesting a possible role for this protein in heterochromatin structure (8).
The goal of the present study was to begin elucidating the function of Scp160p in <span class="yellow">yeast</span> by characterizing the subcellular distribution and macromolecular interactions of this protein. We have demonstrated that Scp160p in cytoplasmic lysates is associated predominantly with polyribosomes, and that following treatment with EDTA, Scp160p remains in an RNase/NaCl-sensitive complex of apparent molecular weight approximately ≥1300 kDa. Affinity purification of this complex revealed the presence of poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1p), a well-characterized component of eukaryotic mRNPs (14,15). Finally, a third abundant protein component of this complex was identified as Bfr1p, a protein not previously reported to associate with mRNPs. While the function of Bfr1p remains unknown, gene deletion reportedly leads to a phenotype remarkably similar to that of scp160 deletion (16). These results indicate a role for Scp160p in mRNA metabolism in <span class="yellow">yeast</span>, and by extension, support results seen with Xenopus vigilin in its interactions with mRNA. To our knowledge, the data reported here demonstrate Scp160p to be the first example of a KH-domain protein that functions as a component of polyribosome-associated mRNP complexes in the <span class="yellow">yeast</span>, <span class="yellow">S.cerevisiae</span>.<br><br>MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plasmids, <span class="yellow">yeast</span> strains and culture conditions
All recombinant DNA manipulations were performed according to standard techniques and utilized <span class="yellow">E.coli</span> strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene). The <span class="yellow">yeast</span> strain JFy1511, expressing FLAG–Scp160p, was derived by two-step gene replacement from strain yJJ52 (MATα gal7Δ102 ura3-52 trp1-289 ade1 lys1 leu2-3, 112; generously donated by Drs Mark Parthun and Judith Jaehning, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center), and confirmed by PCR. The wild-type SCP160 coding sequence was obtained by PCR amplification from a genomic DNA preparation from yJFK1 (MATα gal7Δ102 ura3-52 trp1-289 ade1 lys1 leu2-3, 112 ΔGAL80::URA3), using a 16:1 mixture of Taq (Fisher Biotech) and Pfu (Stratagene) DNA polymerases and the following primers: Scp160F1 (5′-GCCGGTCGA-CTAACTGCAATGTCTGAAGAACAAACCGCTATTG-3′) and Scp160R1 (5′-GCGCGTCGACGAGCTTGTCTATCTT-CTTAAGG-3′). A wild-type SCP160 genomic clone, containing 1 kb upstream and 300 bp downstream sequence was PCR amplified from yJFK1 genomic DNA using the primers Scp160F0 (5′-GCCGAGCTCACACCAGCTTTGTCCTGG-3′) and Scp160R2 (5′-GCGCAAGCTTGTGCGGTA-TCCCAGTCTATG-3′). The resultant clone was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. The N-terminal FLAG and HA tags were added using PCR with the primers ScpFLAGF1(5′-CCAT-TATAACTGCAATGGACTACAAGGACGACGACGACGAC-AAGATGTCTGAAGAACAAACCGCTATTG-3′) and ScpHAF1 (5′-CCCCCTCCTGTCGACATTATAACTGCAATGCACCA-TCACCATCACCATTCTGAAGAACAAACCGCTATTG-3′) respectively. For integration, constructs containing the 1 kb upstream and 300 bp downstream sequence were subcloned into the plasmid YIplac211 (17) using SacI and HindIII restriction sites. The HA-tagged construct was subcloned into the low copy number plasmid, YCplac22 using SacI and HindIII restriction sites. The SCP160 deletion construct was made by removal of a 3.4 kb ApaI–KpnI fragment from the coding region of this construct, followed by treatment with Klenow fragment and re-ligation following attachment of BamHI linker oligonucleotides. Genomic integration of the plasmid sequences and subsequent removal of the endogenous SCP160 allele were achieved by standard two-step gene replacement techniques (18) and confirmed by PCR. The N-terminally HA-tagged allele of BFR1 was generated by PCR-amplifiction of the BFR1 locus from wild-type (W303) <span class="yellow">yeast</span> genomic DNA using the primers BFR1HAF1 (5′-CCGCGGATCCATGTACC-CATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTATGTCCTCCCAAC-AACACAA-3′) and BFR1HINDR1 (5′-CCGCAAGCTTGTCG-ACTATTTCATATGCCACAGGAAACAG-3′), and subcloned into YIPlac211. The BFR1 promoter region was PCR-amplified in a similar manner using the primers BFR1SACF1 (5′-CCGCGAG-CTCAGCATTAAGCATTCACGAGC-3′) and BFR1BAMR1 (5′-CCGCGGATCCGGCAATGGCTGTGTTGTTAGA-3′) and subcloned into the appropriate position upstream of the HA–Bfr1p open reading frame in the plasmid backbone. The entire open reading frame was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Finally, the HA–BFR1 allele was substituted into the <span class="yellow">yeast</span> genome in place of the native allele using linearization with SphI and standard two-step gene replacement techniques. All <span class="yellow">yeast</span> transformations and culture manipulations were performed according to standard protocols as described elsewhere (19).<br><br>Confirmation of genomic integrations
All genomic integrations were confirmed by PCR amplifications from purified <span class="yellow">yeast</span> genomic DNA. For scp160 deletion mutants, the primers Scp160PF (5′-GATTTCCTAACTTTCC-GTCTA-3′) and Scp160R5 (5′-GCGCAAGCTTCACCGCCTTATAACGAAGAC-3′) that flanked the deleted region were used.
Similarly, epitope tags on Scp160p were confirmed by PCR using primers that flanked the tag sequence. Positive clones were further confirmed by western blot analysis of crude cell lysates using the appropriate anti-tag antibodies. The presence of HA–Bfr1p in cells was confirmed by western blot analysis of soluble cell lysates using 12CA5 mAb (Boehringer Mannheim).<br><br>Polyribosome isolation
Polyribosomes were isolated using a combination of protocols described by Stansfield and colleagues (20) and by Dr Maurice Swanson (personal communication). In brief, a 100 ml culture of <span class="yellow">yeast</span> was grown in either YEPD or Hartwell synthetic medium, to early-log phase (OD600 = 1.0), at which time cyclohexamide (Sigma) was added directly to the culture to a final concentration of 100 µg/ml. The culture was incubated on ice for 15 min, and cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 r.p.m./10 min). Following two washes in 10 ml of water containing 100 µg/ml cyclohexamide, cells were lysed by vortex agitation with an equal volume of glass beads in 1 ml lysis buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.2, 50 mM KCl, 30 mM MgCl2, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 200 µg/ml cyclohexamide, 2 µg/ml aprotonin, 1 mM PMSF, 0.5 µg/ml leupeptin, 2.9 µg/ml E64, 1 µg/ml antipain, 0.2 µg/ml chymostatin). Lysate was transferred to a clean microfuge tube, and centrifuged 10 min at 3000 g at 4°C. The supernatant was again transferred to a clean microfuge tube and centrifuged at 12 000 g for 15 min at 4°C, and then assayed for absorbance at 260 nm.
Approximately 12 OD260 units were loaded onto a 11 ml 15–45% sucrose gradient made in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 70 mM NH4Cl, 4 mM MgOAc, using a Gradient Master automatic system, and the gradient was centrifuged in a SW41ti rotor (Beckman) at 39 000 r.p.m. for 2.5 h. 0.5 ml fractions were collected using an Isco gradient fractionator, and gradient profiles were determined by monitoring absorbance at 254 nm. For EDTA controls, lysis buffer containing 5 mM MgCl2 was used, and 30 mM EDTA was added to the sample before loading onto the gradient. Where indicated, addition of 50 U/ml of RNase One (Promega) was performed prior to loading the sample onto the gradient.<br><br>Gel filtration chromatography
Gel filtration chromatography was performed using a 120 ml Hi-Prep S-300 Sephacryl column (Pharmacia) with a cut-off of 1300 kDa, attached to an FPLC system (Pharmacia). The column had been calibrated previously using the following molecular weight standards (Sigma): blue dextran (2000 kDa), thyroglobulin (669 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), and <span class="yellow">bovine</span> serum albumin (66 kDa). <span class="yellow">Yeast</span> were lysed as described for polyribosome analysis, with an additional clarification by passage through a 0.2 µm syringe-tip filter (Acrodisc) and run over the column at a rate of 0.5 ml/min in polyribosome lysis buffer following treatment with the indicated reagents. Fractions (2.0 ml) were collected, from which 12 µl were combined with sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mM dithiothreitol, 60 mM Tris pH 6.8, 0.001% bromophenol blue) and analyzed by western blot using the indicated antibodies.<br><br>α-FLAG affinity chromatography
For most experiments, one liter <span class="yellow">yeast</span> cultures were grown to early log-phase and harvested by centrifugation. Cells were washed twice in T75 buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 75 mM NaCl) and then were lysed by vortex agitation with an equal volume of glass beads in 4 ml T75 buffer containing 30 mM EDTA. Lysate was transferred to a clean microfuge tube, and centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 g at 4°C. The supernatant was again transferred to a clean microfuge tube and centrifuged at 12 000 g for 15 min at 4°C, and finally passed through a 0.2 µm syringe filter. Lysate was then pre-purified by running over the S-300 gel-filtration column in T75 buffer, with pooling of the void volume fractions (~10 ml total). For several experiments (Fig. 5A, B, E and F), a low concentration (<10 µg/ml) of FLAG peptide (N-DYKDDDDK-C) was added to this sample. This void material was then loaded onto a 1 ml M2 α-FLAG column (Sigma); column flow-through was passed over the column a second time. The column was then washed extensively with 75 ml T75 buffer; material bound to the column was eluted with 5 ml T75 containing 184 mg/ml FLAG peptide. The peptide solution was allowed to incubate on the column for 20 min prior to collection of the first 1 ml fraction; subsequent fractions were collected every 10 min. Samples of crude material, S-300 void, α-FLAG flow-through, first and last wash, and eluate fractions were analyzed by western blot using the indicated antibodies. For Figure 5A and E, samples of first and last wash and eluate fractions were concentrated, run on SDS–PAGE and stained with colloidal G250 Coomassie.<br><br>Concentration of samples
Where indicated, samples were concentrated using the method of Traub et al. (21). 400 µl of sample were transferred to a microfuge tube, and combined with 400 µl of methanol, and 100 µl of chloroform. Samples were then vortexed vigorously, and centrifuged for 5 min at 12 000 g. The supernatant was discarded, leaving the interface intact, and an additional 400 µl of methanol was added to each tube. Samples were then inverted several times, and centrifuged again for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the protein pellet was air-dried and resuspended in 1× sample buffer.<br><br>Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (19). Briefly, samples to be analyzed were mixed with sample buffer, boiled, electrophoresed through a 10% SDS–polyacrylamide gel, and electro-blotted onto nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad). FLAG–Scp160p fusion protein was detected by incubation of the filter with <span class="yellow">mouse</span> M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (10 µg/ml final concentration), followed by HRP-conjugated <span class="yellow">sheep</span> anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> secondary antibody (Amersham), diluted 1:5000 as per the manufacturer’s instructions, and ECL reagent (Amersham), followed by exposure to X-ray film. HA-tagged Scp160p and HA-tagged Bfr1p were detected using the 12CA5 mAb (Boehringer Mannheim) at a final concentration of 0.8 µg/ml; Pab1p and Pub1p were detected using 1G1 mAb at 1:5000, and 4C3 mAb at 1:1000, respectively, both generous gifts from Dr Maurice Swanson (22,23). Where appropriate, films were analyzed by scanning densitometry (Molecular Dynamics), and quantitated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics).<br><br>Colloidal G250 coomassie staining
Procedure used was that of Neuhoff (24). Briefly, a one liter stock of staining solution was prepared containing 1 g Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 (Sigma), 100 g ammonium sulfate (Sigma), and 11.76 ml 85% phosphoric acid (Fisher). Following SDS–PAGE, gels were fixed in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid for 10 min. Gels were then rinsed several times in water, then stained using 40 ml of the stock staining solution mixed with 10 ml methanol, for 2 h at room temperature. Stain was then poured off, and residual stain was removed by rinsing in water. By performing a standard analysis using <span class="yellow">bovine</span> serum albumin, the stain was able to detect ~15 ng total protein per lane.<br><br>Pichia expression system
An N-terminally HIS6/FLAG-tagged allele of the SCP160 coding sequence was blunt-end sub-cloned into the BamHI/SnaBI sites of the Pichia expression vector pPIC3.5K (Invitrogen). The construct was then linearized using SalI and integrated into the genome of the Pichia strain GS115 (Invitrogen). High expression transformants were selected initially on histidine-deficient medium followed by selection on increasing concentrations of G418 (US Biological). Crude lysates of the resultant transformants were then confirmed by western blot analysis with the anti-FLAG antibody M2, and the best expressing strain was cultured in a fermenter, harvested, and lysed by agitation with glass beads. To purify Scp160p, 2 ml of crude lysate was first diluted to 10 ml with 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl, then twice passed over a 1 ml α-FLAG affinity column. The column was then washed with 75 ml of 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl, and then eluted with 184 µg/ml FLAG peptide prepared in the same buffer.<br><br>
RESULTS
Expression of tagged Scp160p in <span class="yellow">yeast</span>
An N-terminal FLAG-tagged form of Scp160p was created to facilitate detection of the protein in cells and extracts (Fig. 1A). To probe functionality of this fusion protein, we used two-step gene replacement (18) to substitute the modified allele into the SCP160 locus of haploid <span class="yellow">yeast</span>, and then tested the morphological phenotype of the resultant cells. All strains were confirmed by PCR analysis of the SCP160 locus with appropriate primers (Materials and Methods), and expression of the tagged protein was confirmed by western blot analysis with the appropriate antibody (M2αFLAG) (Fig. 1B). In all cases, <span class="yellow">yeast</span> expressing tagged Scp160p in place of the native protein appeared indistinguishable from the corresponding wild-type strains (data not shown). As a negative control, we also deleted almost the entire SCP160 coding region from the genomes of these <span class="yellow">yeast</span> strains (Fig. 1A), and confirmed the expected mutant phenotype (data not shown).<br><br>Scp160p associates with polyribosomes
To test the hypothesis that Scp160p associates with polyribosomes we used sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation to size-fractionate subcellular components of lysates prepared from <span class="yellow">yeast</span> expressing the N-terminal FLAG-tagged Scp160p protein. Western blot analyses of gradient fractions with an α-FLAG antibody (M2, Boehringer Mannheim), revealed a 160 kDa band that was most abundant in the denser fractions, consistent with the location of polyribosomes (>80S) (Fig. 2A, solid arrow). A convenient internal control for these gradients was provided by an unknown endogenous <span class="yellow">yeast</span> cross-reacting protein at ~100 kDa, that exemplified the migration pattern of a free protein, appearing only in the upper fractions of the gradient (Fig. 2A, open arrow).
To determine whether the migration pattern of Scp160p in these sucrose gradients truly reflected association with <span class="yellow">yeast</span> polyribosomes, lysates were pre-treated with either 30 mM EDTA or 50 U/ml RNase One (Promega) immediately prior to sucrose gradient fractionation. EDTA chelates Mg2+ cations, resulting in the dissociation of the small and large ribosomal subunits, reflected in gradient profiles (OD254) by the disappearance of 80S monosomes and polyribosomes along with a marked increase in the abundance of free ribosomal subunits (Fig. 2B). Under these conditions, the greatest intensity of FLAG–Scp160p signal was seen only in the upper-most fractions of the gradient (Fig. 2B). Alternatively, pre-treatment of lysates with RNase, which results in inter-ribosomal severing of translating messages, gave rise to a large pool of single 80S ribosomes (Fig. 2C). Again, FLAG–Scp160p was shifted to the uppermost fractions of these gradients. Although some of the Scp160p signal was detected in fractions larger than 40S, the migration pattern of the 100 kDa cross-reacting protein in these experiments indicated that RNase treatment caused an apparent diffusion of material in the upper portion of the gradient.<br><br>Characterization of Scp160p-containing complexes following EDTA and RNase treatment
Gel-filtration chromatography was used to determine the apparent molecular weight of Scp160p following its release from polyribosomes by both EDTA and RNase treatment. Lysates were prepared as described above for sucrose gradient analysis, but were instead size fractionated over a Sephacryl S-300 Hi-Prep column, with an inclusion cut-off of 1300 kDa. As expected, Scp160p from untreated lysates eluted in the void volume, confirming its association with large complexes, ostensibly polyribosomes (Fig. 3A, solid arrow). In EDTA treated lysates, all Scp160p signal was still detected in the void volume, indicating it remained in a complex of >1300 kDa (Fig. 3B, solid arrow). In contrast, limited RNase treatment (10 min) resulted in the appearance of an Scp160p-containing species of ~450 kDa, in addition to a fraction still visible in the void (Fig. 3C, solid arrow). More extensive RNase treatment (30 min) led to complete conversion to the 450 kDa species (Fig. 3D, solid arrow). Sequential treatment, first with RNase, then with EDTA, also resulted in a 450 kDa species (data not shown), suggesting that all components of this apparent 450 kDa complex were also present following EDTA treatment alone. As before, the 100 kDa, endogenous α-FLAG cross-reacting protein (Fig. 3, open arrows) served as a convenient internal control, eluting from the column at a volume consistent with its expected monomeric size.
To characterize further the stability of the large (apparent molecular weight >1300 kDa), EDTA-resistant complex, lysates were treated with increasing concentrations of NaCl prior to size fractionation (Fig. 3, panels E, F and G). As shown in Figure 3E, at 75 mM NaCl, the large complex remained intact. However, at a NaCl concentration of 150 mM, the Scp160p complex was partially reduced to 450 kDa, with some signal still remaining in the void (Fig. 3F, solid arrow). Following treatment with 1 M NaCl, Scp160p was only visible as the 450 kDa species (Fig. 3G, solid arrow). The fact that RNase treatment and high salt both generated Scp160p species of similar apparent molecular weight suggests that these high salt concentrations resulted in the disassociation of RNA, and perhaps other components, from Scp160p.<br><br>Pab1p and Bfr1p are present in EDTA-resistant Scp160p-containing complexes
To determine if the >1300 kDa Scp160p-containing complexes remaining after EDTA treatment were mRNPs, we assayed for the presence of the <span class="yellow">yeast</span> poly(A) binding protein, Pab1p, following α-FLAG affinity purification as illustrated in Figure 4. Pab1p is an abundant and well-characterized component of mRNP complexes in <span class="yellow">yeast</span>, as well as higher eukaryotes (14,15,25). As seen in Figure 5A and B, Pab1p did co-purify with FLAG–Scp160p; moreover, treatment with RNase immediately prior to FLAG-purification completely abolished this interaction (Fig. 5C), indicating an RNA-dependant association between these two proteins.
We also probed the isolated complexes for the presence of another abundant mRNP-component protein, Pub1p (23,26). Pub1p, as opposed to Pab1p, is not reported to associate with polyribosomes, and is hypothesized to bind a pool of non-translatable mRNAs (23). As predicted, Pub1p did not co-purify with Scp160p (Fig. 5D). The absence of Pub1p in Scp160p-containing complexes served as a negative control, demonstrating that abundant RNA-binding proteins did not co-purify non-specifically by this protocol. In addition, we performed mock purifications using lysates from <span class="yellow">yeast</span> expressing the wild-type allele of SCP160 without the FLAG epitope (Fig. 5F), or with an unrelated FLAG-tagged protein, <span class="yellow">human</span> galactose 1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT) (Fig. 5G, lower panel). In neither case did Pab1p bind and elute from the FLAG affinity column. Finally, no bands were visible by colloidal G250 Coomassie staining of samples from the mock (wild-type) preparations (Fig. 5E), further demonstrating the specificity of this procedure.
By colloidal G250 Coomassie staining (Materials and Methods) of the FLAG-purified complex, we observed in addition to Scp160p, two major bands, at ~70 kDa and ~55 kDa, which ostensibly represent co-purifying proteins (Fig. 5A, bottom panel). Western blot analysis suggested that the ~70 kDa species is Pab1p. To identify the 55 kDa protein, that band was excised from the gel, and sent to the Keck microchemical facility at Yale University for analysis by in gel tryptic digestion, followed by MALDI-mass spectrometry. The results of these analyses clearly identified the unknown protein as Bfr1p. To confirm this result, an N-terminal HA tag was engineered onto the genomic BFR1 locus in strains expressing FLAG-tagged or wild-type Scp160p. Scp160p complexes were then isolated from both of these strains using the protocol described above. As seen in Figure 6, an HA-tagged protein of ~55 kDa (center panel) appears in α-FLAG column elutions only when FLAG–Scp160p is also present (top panel). No signal is visible in mock purifications of extracts where Scp160p is not FLAG-tagged (bottom panel).<br><br>Monomeric Scp160p migrates as a ~450 kDa protein under native conditions
As a first step to characterize the post RNase/NaCl 450 kDa Scp160p species we compared it with Scp160p over-expressed and purified from an exogenous host, the <span class="yellow">yeast</span> <span class="yellow">Pichia pastoris</span>. The purified N-terminal FLAG/hexahistidine-tagged Scp160p was run over an S300 gel filtration column; 2 ml fractions were collected and analyzed by α-FLAG western blot. As seen in Figure 7A, purified Scp160p eluted at a volume consistent with a >443 kDa protein. To confirm that no other proteins were associated with the purified Scp160p, 12 µl of the protein was run on SDS–PAGE and subjected to colloidal G250 Coomassie staining before loading on the S-300 column (Fig. 7B). As shown, no bands other than Scp160p were visible.
Several KH-domain proteins, including Sam68 and FMRP, have been reported to form homodimers in vivo (27). Therefore, we explored the possibility that the ~450 kDa Scp160p species might contain two or more copies of Scp160p. To test this hypothesis, <span class="yellow">yeast</span> expressing FLAG–Scp160p were transfected with a centromeric plasmid, YCplac22–HA–Scp160p, encoding a distinct, HA-tagged allele of the protein. The functionality of this tagged protein had previously been demonstrated by polyribosome association as well as complementation of the null morphological phenotype in cells expressing only HA–Scp160p (data not shown). As seen in Figure 7C, when <span class="yellow">yeast</span> co-expressing the two alleles were lysed and the FLAG-tagged protein was isolated as described above, no HA–Scp160p co-purified with the FLAG–Scp160p. These data strongly suggest that Scp160p does not form homo-dimers or higher-order multimers in vivo, and that the ~450 kDa species of Scp160p observed is simply the monomeric protein.<br><br>
DISCUSSION
The data presented here demonstrate two main points regarding the biochemical associations and function of Scp160p in <span class="yellow">yeast</span>. First, the sucrose gradient fractionation data clearly demonstrate that Scp160p exists primarily associated with large complexes, likely to be polyribosomes. To our knowledge, this is the first time a vigilin family member has been shown to associate with polyribosomes in this manner. Interestingly, Weber and colleagues did not observe sucrose gradient fractionation data consistent with polyribosome association of Scp160p (5). These authors hypothesized that Scp160p associates only with membrane-bound polyribosomes, and that Scp160p is not found complexed with cytosolic polyribosomes (5). Our data do not support this hypothesis, since unlike Weber and colleagues, we were able to detect significant amounts of Scp160p associated with polyribosomes without using detergents during preparation. There are several possible explanations for this discrepancy. First, the lysate buffer utilized by that group contained 100 mM NaCl, whereas our buffer contained 50 mM KCl. Our data shown in Figure 3 suggest that 100 mM NaCl may have caused an instability in the Scp160p–RNA interaction, leading to release from polyribosomes during their procedure. Secondly, Weber’s lysate buffer reportedly contained heparin to inhibit ribonucleases; a number of reports (28,29) suggest that heparin can disrupt RNA–protein interactions. Although we have not in the past included heparin in any of our experiments, we have observed disruption of the polyribosome association in buffer containing residual diethylpyrocarbonate, another inhibitor of ribonucleases (data not shown).
Second, our data provide compelling evidence that Scp160p is released from polyribosomes as a component of an mRNP complex. Since Scp160p does not remain associated with either single ribosomes or ribosomal subunits following treatment with EDTA or RNase, it seems unlikely that Scp160p is a constitutive component of the translational machinery. Partial purification of the EDTA-resistant Scp160p complexes allowed us to demonstrate the presence of Pab1p but not Pub1p in these preparations, which is consistent with the idea that Scp160p associates with polyribosomes as a component of mRNP complexes. Previously, Scp160p had been shown to bind ribohomopolymers and rRNA in vitro, although the in vivo nucleic acid targets of Scp160p were unknown (5). The presence of Pab1p in RNase-sensitive Scp160p complexes indicates that Scp160p is primarily bound to polyadenylated RNAs. Whether or not Scp160p binds only specific sets of mRNAs will be the subject of future studies.
In addition to Scp160p and Pab1p, we have identified a third component of the complex, the protein Bfr1p. The gene, BFR1, was originally identified in a screen for high-copy suppressors of Brefeldin-A induced lethality, suggesting a role in the secretory pathway (16). Interestingly, however, bfr1 null mutants do not demonstrate any defects in the secretory pathway, but rather display similar phenotypes to scp160 null mutants, most notably increased ploidy and increased cell size (16). It is therefore unclear whether Bfr1p is capable of functioning in both RNA metabolism and secretion directly, or if the Scp160p–Bfr1p complex regulates the expression of one or more secretory genes at the post-transcriptional level. Additionally, two-hybrid analysis indicated an interaction of Bfr1p with the protein Bbp1p, a component of the mitotic spindle apparatus (30). While Bbp1p is an essential gene, overexpression leads to a phenotype similar to both bfr1 and scp160 null strains (30). Future work will address the functional relationship between Scp160p and Bfr1p including the possibility that these proteins represent a regulatory mechanism connecting the translational machinery with cell division and/or the secretory pathway.
Following treatment with either RNase or >150 mM NaCl, Scp160p remained as an apparent ~450 kDa species. Considering that purified Scp160p alone also migrates at this size, we conclude that this apparent complex may consist only of Scp160p, although the presence of other small components cannot be ruled out at this time. Furthermore, by utilizing <span class="yellow">yeast</span> co-expressing two distinct epitope-tagged versions of Scp160p, we have ruled out the possibility of self-association of Scp160p. Although both tagged proteins appear functional, it remains a formal possibility that the tags somehow prevented formation of FLAG–HA hetero-complexes. Nonetheless, it seems most likely that native Scp160p monomers may simply migrate aberrantly under native conditions due to an unusual shape or some other physical property.
In conclusion we have shown convincing evidence that Scp160p exists in <span class="yellow">yeast</span> cytoplasmic extracts primarily associated with polyribosomes. We have purified Scp160p following disruption of polyribosomes with EDTA, and identified two associated proteins: Pab1p and Bfr1p. The presence of Pab1p suggests that Scp160p associates with polyribosomes as a component of an mRNP, demonstrating Scp160p to be the first <span class="yellow">S.cerevisiae</span> multiple-KH domain protein characterized to function in this way.<br><br>
<h3>pmcA1131934</h3>HP1 modulates the transcription of cell-cycle regulators in <span class="yellow">Drosophila melanogaster</span>
Abstract
Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) was originally described as a non-histone chromosomal protein and is required for transcriptional gene silencing and the formation of heterochromatin. Although it is localized primarily at pericentric heterochromatin, a scattered distribution over a large number of euchromatic loci is also evident. Here, we provide evidence that <span class="blue">Drosophila</span> HP1 is essential for the maintenance of active transcription of euchromatic genes functionally involved in cell-cycle progression, including those required for DNA replication and mitosis. Depletion of HP1 in proliferating embryonic cells caused aberrant progression of the cell cycle at S phase and G2/M phase, linked to aberrant chromosome segregation, cytokinesis, and an increase in apoptosis. The chromosomal distribution of Aurora B, and the level of phosphorylation of histone H3 serine 10 were also altered in the absence of HP1. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we further demonstrate that the promoters of a number of cell-cycle regulator genes are bound to HP1, supporting a direct role for HP1 in their active transcription. Overall, our data suggest that HP1 is essential for the maintenance of cell-cycle progression and the transcription of cell-cycle regulatory genes. The results also support the view that HP1 is a positive regulator of transcription in euchromatin.<br><br>INTRODUCTION
Chromatin in higher eukaryotes is subdivided into different functional compartments termed heterochromatin and euchromatin (1). Heterochromatin differs from euchromatin in its DNA composition, replication timing, condensation throughout the cell cycle, and its ability to silence euchromatic genes placed adjacent to or within its territory, often described as position-effect-variegation (PEV) (2).
Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) was the first protein identified in <span class="yellow">Drosophila melanogaster</span> as a heterochromatin-associated protein (3); the corresponding gene has been cloned from a number of organisms and is highly conserved from <span class="yellow">yeast</span> to <span class="yellow">human</span> (4). Polytene chromosome staining showed that, in <span class="blue">Drosophila</span>, HP1 is distributed mainly in pericentric heterochromatin, telomeric heterochromatin, the banded small fourth chromosome (5–8), as well as ∼200 individual loci scattered throughout the euchromatic chromosomal arms (5). The gene encoding HP1 in <span class="yellow">D.melanogaster</span>, Su(var)2-5, was isolated as a suppressor of PEV (9–11). The protein contains a highly conserved motif, the chromo (chromatin organization modifier) domain, similar to Polycomb (Pc), a repressor of homeotic genes (12). The association between HP1 and pericentric heterochromatin is believed to occur via the chromo domain of HP1 and the N-terminal tail of histone H3 methylated at lysine 9 (13,14), generated by histone methyltransferase-Su(var)3-9, a partner of HP1 in pericentric heterochromatin (15). The C-terminal chromo ‘shadow’ domain of HP1 interacts with other silencing complexes to suppress local transcriptional activity (15–18). However, studies of HP1 chromosomal distribution also showed that HP1 does not always co-localize with lysine 9 methylated histone H3 or Su(var)3-9, especially in euchromatic regions (19–21); in some cases, HP1 is found directly bound to DNA (22,23). All these features argue for distinct roles for HP1 in chromatin and in epigenetic gene regulation.
HP1 is believed to be an essential structural protein protecting the integrity of chromosomes during cell division (8,24). Swi6, the homolog of HP1 in <span class="yellow">fission yeast</span>, is dispensable for survival, but its deletion results in lagging chromosomes during anaphase, and a high rate of chromosome loss (25,26). Mutations of HP1 in <span class="yellow">D.melanogaster</span> result in late larval lethality, chromosome breakages/loss, telomere fusion and a high frequency of cells with abnormal anaphase (8,27). Null alleles of the HP1 functional partner in <span class="yellow">mice</span> (SUVAR39) also showed various chromosomal defects (28), supporting a conserved role for heterochromatin proteins in the regulation of chromosome dynamics during cell-cycle progression. However, the mechanism(s) involved remains to be understood.
In this study, we utilized <span class="blue">Drosophila</span> embryonic Kc cells and an RNA interference (RNAi)-based approach to demonstrate that HP1 plays an important role at S phase and G2/M phases during the cell cycle. We further show that nearly one-third of known/predicted cell-cycle regulators require HP1 to maintain their active transcription. These genes include MCMs, Orc4, CDC45L, INCENP, Aurora B, CAF1, Bub1, Bub3 and a few other cell-cycle regulators. ChIP analysis suggests that HP1 plays a direct role in their transcription. Therefore, the results of this study provide an alternative explanation for the specific role of HP1 in the regulation of chromatin dynamics and in cell-cycle progression.<br><br>MATERIALS AND METHODS
RNAi in Kc cells
<span class="blue">Drosophila</span> Kc cells were routinely cultured at 25°C in Schneider <span class="blue">Drosophila</span> medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal <span class="yellow">calf</span> serum, 160 μg/ml penicillin, 250 μg/ml streptomycin, and 4 mM l-glutamine. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of HP1 was generated by incubation of single-stranded RNA in annealing buffer (100 mM potassium acetate, 30 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mM magnesium acetate) for 3 min at 95°C and then placed in a beaker with water at 75°C and allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. The detailed procedure of RNAi was carried out according to the established protocols (). Briefly, Kc cells were seeded in a six-well dish using serum-free medium at 1 × 106 cells/ml. HP1 dsRNA (5 μg/ml) was added to the cultured Kc cells. After 60 min at room temperature, 2 ml of medium containing 10% serum was added to each well and the plates transferred to 25°C for up to 8 days. Western blotting and RT–PCR were carried out using the extract/total RNA isolated from control and dsRNA-treated cells on days 2, 6 and 8.<br><br>Cell-cycle and apoptosis analysis
The procedure for flow cytometric analysis of Kc cells followed that in the manual provided with the BrdU flow kit (BD PharMingen). The cells were fed with BrdU for 4 h, then scraped and collected. Fluorescence was measured using a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson). Data collection and analysis were performed using CellQuest software.<br><br>Electrophoresis and immunoblotting
Cell extracts (15 μg) were fractionated by 10% SDS–PAGE, then transferred to Hybond-P PVDF membranes (Amersham) and probed with primary antibodies (CIA9), and secondary antibodies (anti-<span class="yellow">rabbit</span> or anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> <span class="yellow">horseradish</span> peroxidase-conjugated IgG), obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories. Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used for signal detection.
For the analysis of H3 ser10 phosphorylation, we used whole-cell extracts from 700 000 Kc cells (control and RNAi at day 8). Western blotting was performed using polyclonal antibodies against ser10-phosphorylated histone H3 at a dilution of 1:1000 (Upstate). Kc control cells arrested in mitosis by incubation in 25 µM colchicine (Sigma) for 24 h were also analyzed for comparison.<br><br>Immunofluorescence
Kc cells were seeded onto polylysine slides, fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. The incubation with primary antibodies was carried out in blocking solution for 1 h.
For staining of mitotic cells, the cells were permeabilized using PBST (PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100) and stained with polyclonal antibody against <span class="blue">Drosophila</span> Aurora B at 1:200 dilution and monoclonal <span class="yellow">mouse</span> at anti-β-tubulin 1:300 dilution (Chemicon International) as primary antibodies. Secondary antibodies were anti-<span class="yellow">rabbit</span> coupled with Alexa 488 (1:500) and anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> coupled to Alexa 546 (1:500) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon). Images were acquired using a confocal LSM510 META microscope (Zeiss). Stacks of images were analyzed using the IMARIS 4.0 program (Media cybernetics, Carlsbad, CA).<br><br>Antibodies
Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies of HP1 (<span class="yellow">rabbit</span> #192 and #187, 5 μg) and 5 μg of polyclonal anti-HA antibodies (Sigma) were used in each ChIP reaction. The specificity of the HP1 polyclonal antibodies was determined using various approaches, including western blotting assay, immunofluorescence staining and immunoprecipitation to pull down HP1 (data not shown). The monoclonal antibody HP1–CIA9 (5) was used at a dilution of 1:20 in immunoblotting assays.<br><br>Microarray analysis and RT–PCR
Total RNA was isolated from control and HP1-depleted Kc cells at day 8 using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA labeling and microarray data analysis followed the standard protocol from Affymetrix. We used ANOVA (P < 0.001) to assess the expression confidence for each gene.
For RT–PCR analysis, poly(A)+ mRNA was purified with the Oligotex Direct mRNA kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified poly(A)+ RNA was reverse transcribed using the Thermoscript kit (Invitrogen). The cDNA was then used for PCR amplification for 35 cycles with gene-specific primers. PCR products were scanned after electrophoretic separation with a Typhoon Scanner, quantified using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences) and normalized for amplification of the Actin5c transcript. The sequence of primers used for RT–PCR and ChIP analysis are provided in the Supplementary Material.<br><br>ChIP
ChIP was performed according to Orlando et al. (29) and the protocol provided by Upstate () with some modifications. In brief, 1–2 × 108 Kc cells were prepared and fixed in 1% formaldehyde. Nuclei were isolated according to a standard procedure in Current Protocols (), then resuspended in 1.7 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS and protease inhibitors) and sonicated using a Branson sonifier 250. Chromatin fractions in the size range 0.2–0.8 kb were used to perform immunoprecipitation experiments. We used 5 μg affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies (#192 and #182 for HP1; HA antibody for control) and 1 ml of <span class="yellow">salmon</span> sperm DNA/protein-A-agarose (Upstate) pre-cleared chromatin lysate in each reaction. The mixture was then rotated at 4°C overnight and the recovered beads were washed twice with 1 ml of Low salt buffer (Upstate), once with High salt buffer (Upstate), once with LiCl buffer (Upstate) and twice with TE at 4°C for 8 min. ChIP DNA was extracted according to the standard procedures (29).<br><br>
RESULTS
Depletion of HP1 in <span class="blue">Drosophila</span> Kc cells
Various chromosomal defects in the cell cycle have been observed in embryos or larval tissues of <span class="blue">Drosophila</span> HP1 mutants (8,27). However, the presence of maternally loaded HP1 in embryos and the lethality of HP1 mutants at late larval stages have so far precluded a systematic study of the role of HP1 in cell-cycle regulation. Therefore, we used <span class="blue">Drosophila</span> Kc cells, a cell line derived from <span class="blue">Drosophila</span> embryos, as a model system to address this problem. HP1 transcripts were depleted using an RNAi-based approach (see Materials and Methods). The reduction in HP1 expression was measured both by RT–PCR and by western blotting analysis (Figure 1A). A significant reduction in the HP1 expression was already evident after 2 days treatment with HP1 dsRNA. Cells at day 8 showed a reduction in HP1 of ∼90% (Figure 1A) and were therefore used in all subsequent experiments.<br><br>Cell-cycle progression at S and G2/M phase is altered in the absence of HP1
The impact of HP1 loss on the cell cycle of Kc cells was determined using cell-cycle profile analysis of HP1-depleted and control cells. The percentage of cells in S phase was determined by BrdU incorporation, and total DNA content by 7-amino-actinomycin (7-AAD). The results showed that the depletion of HP1 (day 8) caused a decrease in S-phase cells of at least 4-fold, and a 2-fold decrease in G2/M-phase cells (Figure 1B), although no significant effect was found at the G1 phase. In addition, depletion of HP1 caused a greater than 7-fold increase in the number of apoptotic cells. These results, therefore, confirm that HP1 is an important regulator during the cell cycle, especially at the S and G2/M phases.<br><br>Cell-cycle regulators require HP1 to maintain their active transcription
To ask whether the cell-cycle defects were due to changes in the transcription of genes functionally involved in S phase and the G2/M phase, we next assessed global changes in gene transcription following depletion of HP1. Expression profile analysis was performed using total RNA isolated from both HP1-depleted Kc cells and control Kc cells, and an Affymetrix <span class="blue">Drosophila</span> chip. For each experiment, we used total RNA isolated from two independent HP1-depleted and control samples, and at least two independent experiments were performed.
The microarray analysis showed that loss of HP1 function in Kc cells resulted in alterations in transcription of >500 genes: ∼400 genes were down-regulated and ∼120 genes were up-regulated (>1.5-fold, ANOVA). The function of these genes ranged from cellular enzymes, signal transduction molecules, and membrane and cell structural proteins, to nucleic acid-binding proteins and cell-cycle regulators (Figure 2A). At the chromosomal level, the genes targeted by HP1 appeared to be distributed along all euchromatic chromosomal arms (data not shown), supporting a global role of HP1 in euchromatic gene regulation (20).
Among 60 known/predicted genes associated with DNA replication function, 15 were down-regulated in the absence of HP1 (Figure 2B). These included McM2, McM5, McM6 and CDC45L, which are required for processive DNA replication and correct chromosome condensation (30–32). Other genes involved in DNA replication, such as components of the origin recognition complex (Orc)—Orc4, Caf1, Gnf1, Dref1, DNA polymerase-γ and Tam—were also down-regulated (Figure 2B). Aurora B and inner centromere protein (INCENP), known to be required for kinetochore assembly, chromosome condensation and bipolar chromosome attachment during mitosis (33), also showed a reduction in transcription. A similar loss of transcription was observed in Bub1 and Bub3 (Figure 2B), encoding mitotic checkpoint control proteins (34,35). Loss function of Bub1 has been shown to cause chromatin bridges to extend between the two separating groups of chromosomes, and extensive chromosome fragmentation in anaphase cells (35).
We confirmed the changes in the transcription of cell-cycle regulators using semi-quantitative RT–PCR, which gave results consistent with the microarray analysis. In addition, cell-cycle regulator genes, such as McM3, McM7 and Asp (abnormal spindle), were also confirmed to be down-regulated (Figure 2C). Collectively, these results demonstrate that HP1 is indeed involved in the regulation of transcription of cell-cycle regulators.<br><br>HP1 is required for Aurora B distribution and histone H3 phosphorylation
INCENP is localized to the centromeric region of chromosomes at metaphase and the spindle midzone at anaphase, which then targets Aurora B, a kinase essential for histone H3 ser10 phosphorylation, to these sites (36). Loss of function of both these ‘chromosomal passenger’ proteins causes abnormal chromosomal segregation at metaphase, as well as certain cytokinesis defects (36,37). The loss of transcription of both INCENP and Aurora B after depletion of HP1, therefore, raised the possibility that localization of Aurora B (Figure 3 and data not shown) may be altered. Staining of HP1-depleted Kc cells with anti-Aurora B antibodies indeed revealed an altered localization of Aurora B and, in a number of cases, a complete loss of Aurora B (Figure 3A). Consistent with the loss function of Aurora B, the spindles in the metaphase cells were also disorganized, with a large number of cells showing an altered prometaphase chromosome alignment (Figure 3A). Some showed extensive chromosome fragmentation (Figure 3B), or the presence of a third spindle pole-like structure as indicated by beta-tubulin (Figure 3A). At telophase, we observed defective separating cells with an extra cell envelope-like structure without nuclei (Figure 3A). Chromatin bridges or lagging chromatids at telophase were also evident in some cells (Figure 3C); however, in some cases, localization of Aurora B appeared not to be affected, arguing that other pathways are possibly involved.
We next analyzed changes in histone H3 serine 10 phosphorylation, since the loss of transcription of INCENP is known to affect localization of Aurora B (33), which is essential in the regulation of histone H3 phosphorylation (36). Total cell extracts from HP1-depleted Kc cells were analyzed by western blotting (Figure 3D). The results indeed showed a severalfold reduction in H3 ser10 phosphorylation after depletion of HP1, consistent with the functional disruption of INCENP and Aurora B in the absence of HP1.<br><br>HP1 directly targets genes encoding cell-cycle regulators in euchromatin
To test whether the loss of transcription of genes involved in DNA replication and mitosis was a direct effect of the loss of HP1, we performed a ChIP analysis to determine whether HP1 is physically associated with these genes. Chromatin lysates from formaldehyde-fixed Kc cells were sonicated into small chromatin fragments (0.2–0.8 kb) and immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies against <span class="blue">Drosophila</span> HP1. As a control, we used a mock precipitation (beads only) and polyclonal antibodies against HA. Our ChIP results showed that known transposable elements distributed in heterochromatin, such as F-element, TART and 1360 (7,38), were all enriched in HP1 binding (Figure 4), which is also consistent with a previous study (20).
Using the same ChIP DNA material, we then attempted to determine whether HP1 was enriched in genes involved in DNA replication. Primers were designed to cover the promoter regions of selected genes. The results showed that McM3, McM5 and Tam were all enriched in HP1 binding (Figure 4). However, McM7 appeared to be HP1-negative, although its transcription was also affected by the loss of HP1 function. Genes essential for mitosis, such as Aurora B, were also HP1-positive (Figure 4). These results demonstrate that these cell-cycle regulator genes are directly targeted by HP1 in their promoter regions.<br><br>
DISCUSSION
In this study, we used microarray and RT–PCR techniques to demonstrate that transcription of cell-cycle regulators is misregulated in the absence of HP1. Certain defects in S phase may be a direct consequence of the loss of transcription of DNA replication genes such as McM2, McM5, McM6, CDC45L, Orc4 and others, since these genes have been functionally implicated in the initiation of DNA replication and/or the progression of replication forks (39). Depletion or mutation of these genes has been shown to result in DNA damage (32), the blockage of replication forks (39), increased chromosome loss/genome instability, and defective condensation (30).
The reduction in the number of cells in G2/M phase may be a consequence of the reduction in transcription or functional disruption of INCENP, Aurora B, Bub1, and Bub3 (34,36). Chromosome segregation defects, such as chromosome fragmentation and chromatin bridges in anaphase/telophase cells, and certain cytokinesis defects in HP1-depleted cells, mimic the phenotype of cells with loss function of INCENP, Aurora B or Bub1 (35–37). The mislocalization of Aurora B in the absence of HP1 is also consistent with the loss of transcription and functional disruption of INCENP (37), and the reduction in Aurora B transcription may be partially responsible for the observed chromosomal defects, including loss of histone H3 phosphorylation at serine 10.
HP1 is also known to physically interact with certain components of replication complexes such as ORCs and MCMs (30,40,41), with the inner centromere protein INCENP (42) and the chromatin assembly factor CAF1 (43) promoting delivery of HP1 to heterochromatin sites (44). Loss of HP1 is, therefore, expected to cause disruption to such HP1-associated complexes, and will partially contribute to the chromatin/chromosomal defects in HP1 mutants (8,27) and HP1-depleted Kc cells. It is therefore well possible that the loss of transcription of these cell-cycle regulator genes, and consequent disruption of HP1 functional complexes or heterochromatin structure, all contributed to the cell-cycle defects observed.
The ChIP assay supports the hypothesis that the loss of transcription of cell-cycle regulator genes is a direct effect of the lack of HP1. Aurora B, McM3, and McM5 were all bound by HP1 at their promoter regions, although other cell-cycle regulators, such as McM7, were HP1-negative, implying that the altered transcription in these genes might be a secondary effect of the loss of HP1.
A previous study in <span class="blue">Drosophila</span> Kc cells (20) employed an approach based on the ectopic expression of a fusion protein of HP1 with a prokaryotic DNA adenine methyltransferase and identified a number of methylated targets in the genome. In this study, MCM3 and MCM5 were not found to be methylated, indicating lack of association with HP1. On the other hand, heterochromatin repeats, such F-element and 1360, were consistently found to be HP1-enriched both here and in the previous study. It remains to be determined whether these discrepancies are due to the different experimental systems used. However, we note that the previous study was performed using a cDNA array, while we observe binding of endogenous HP1 at the promoter of these genes. Similarly, another study using chromatin immunoprecipitation in larvae also showed few HP1-positive genes that were not detected in Kc cells by the Dam ID approach (21).
A large number of genes affected by the loss of <span class="yellow">D.melanogaster</span> HP1 in larval tissues (21) seem to be different from that in embryonic Kc cells. The change in the transcription of Aurora B and few cell-cycle regulators reported in this study is also not found among the HP1-affected genes at larval stage (21). This may be due to specific role(s) of HP1 in different stages of development. Alternatively, it is also possible that the impact of HP1 in the transcription of cell-cycle regulators in proliferating cells is underestimated when performing the analyses on larval tissues, and thus on mixed populations of both proliferating and differentiating/differentiated cells.
HP1 is generally known as a transcriptional repressor, as supported by several lines of evidence: silencing of a euchromatic reporter gene in heterochromatin requires HP1 (10,11), tethering of HP1 next to a euchromatic reporter gene causes silencing (45), and the repression of genes within euchromatic region 31 bound by HP1 is relieved in the absence of HP1 (46). In contrast, genes in heterochromatin, known as heterochromatic genes, such as light and rolled, seem to require HP1 to maintain their active transcription (47,48). The level of transcription of heterochromatic genes was dramatically reduced in a mutated HP1 background (47–49). It was therefore proposed that HP1 may function as a positive regulator of transcription of these genes (50,51), although the exact regulation mechanism remains unclear. A study of heat-shock genes found that HP1 is associated with RNA transcripts in the coding region, and is also a positive regulator of their transcription (52,53). The chromatin association of HP1 at the promoter region of active euchromatic genes demonstrated from this work and others, and its independence from histone H3K9 methylation (21), all suggest that mechanism whereby HP1 modulates transcription of euchromatic genes is potentially distinct from its role in heterochromatin formation.
Collectively, the results of this study demonstrate that HP1 plays an essential role in cell-cycle progression, and support the view that HP1, in addition to its role in heterochromatin, can act as a positive transcriptional regulator of euchromatic genes.<br><br>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL

<h3>pmcA140510</h3>Enp1, a <span class="yellow">yeast</span> protein associated with U3 and U14 snoRNAs, is required for pre-rRNA processing and 40S subunit synthesis
Abstract
ENP1 is an essential <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> gene encoding a 483 amino acid polypeptide. Enp1 protein is localized in the nucleus and concentrated in the nucleolus. An enp1-1 temperature-sensitive mutant inhibited 35S pre-rRNA early processing at sites A0, A1 and A2 as shown by northern analysis of steady state levels of rRNA precursors. Pulse-chase analysis further revealed that the enp1-1 strain was defective in the synthesis of 20S pre-rRNA and hence 18S rRNA, which led to reduced formation of 40S ribosomal subunits. Co-precipitation analysis revealed that Enp1 was associated with Nop1 protein, as well as with U3 and U14 RNAs, two snoRNAs implicated in early pre-rRNA processing steps. These results suggest a direct role for Enp1 in the early steps of rRNA processing.<br><br>INTRODUCTION
Ribosome biogenesis is one of the major cellular activities in eukaryotic cells. It takes place primarily in a specialized subnuclear compartment, the nucleolus (1,2). In the <span class="yellow">yeast</span> <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, each rRNA gene is transcribed by RNA polymerase I into a 35S rRNA precursor, consisting of 18S, 5.8S and 25S rRNA sequences flanked by two external transcribed spacers (ETS) and separated by two internal transcribed spacers (ITS) (Fig. 1). This 35S precursor goes through a series of modifications and processing steps to generate the mature 18S, 5.8S and 25S rRNAs. The processing occurs first at sites A0, A1 and A2, resulting in the 20S pre-rRNA and 27SA2 pre-rRNA. The 20S pre-rRNA is then cleaved, leading to the mature 18S rRNA found in the 40S ribosomal subunit. The 27SA2 pre-rRNA is processed through two alternative pathways. The majority of 27SA2 pre-rRNA is cleaved at sites A3 and B2 to form the 27SA3 pre-rRNA, which is subsequently processed to produce 27SBS. Alternatively, 27SA2 pre-rRNA can be processed at sites B1L and B2 to generate 27SBL pre-rRNA. Both 27SBS and 27SBL pre-rRNAs are then cleaved at sites C1 and C2 to generate the mature 25S rRNA, and 7SS or 7SL intermediates, which are then processed to mature 5.8SS or 5.8SL rRNAs (Fig. 1). The 25S rRNA and 5.8S rRNA are the RNA components of the 60S ribosomal subunit (3). During the course of rRNA modification and processing, many of the ribosomal proteins are assembled onto the rRNA molecules to form the ribosome complex.
Ribosome biogenesis needs a large number of trans-acting factors, including small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), protein components of the snoRNP complexes, rRNA modifying enzymes, endo- and exonucleases, putative RNA helicases and other protein factors (3,4). In <span class="yellow">yeast</span> cells there are more than 100 different snoRNAs playing important roles in rRNA modification and processing. On the basis of their structure, the snoRNAs can be divided into two groups: the box C/D family and box H/ACA family. Only one snoRNA, MRP RNA, belongs to neither family (5–7). While the majority of the snoRNAs participate in RNA pseudouridylation and 2′-O-ribose methylation, a few of them, including MRP snoRNA, box C/D snoRNAs U3 and U14, and box H/ACA snoRNAs snR10 and snR30, are required for processing of the pre-rRNA (8–12). Not only are U3, U14, snR10 and snR30 essential for early cleavages of 35S pre-rRNA to 18S rRNA, the proteins associated with them, including Nop1, Nop5, Gar1 and Nop10, have also been shown to be required for 18S rRNA synthesis (13–16).
The ENP1 (Essential Nuclear Protein 1) gene was identified in a genetic screen for suppressors of an ost4 mutation (oligosaccharide transferase 4) (17). However, in subsequent studies it was found not to be involved in OST4 function (18). ENP1 is an essential gene encoding a 483 amino acid polypeptide. The Enp1 protein is highly conserved and homologs are found in all eukaryotes. The <span class="yellow">yeast</span> protein was localized to the nucleus in a previous study (18). On the other hand, an Enp1 <span class="yellow">human</span> homolog, called bystin, was reported to localize to the cytoplasm and was proposed to be involved in cell adhesion (19).
In this study, we report that the Enp1 protein not only is nuclear but is enriched in the nucleolus. We also found that Enp1 is required for the synthesis of 40S ribosomal subunits, and its presence is necessary for the pre-rRNA processing to form 20S pre-rRNA and 18S rRNA. An association between Enp1 and U3 and U14 snoRNAs, and with the nucleolar protein Nop1, was established. We also found that <span class="yellow">human</span> Enp1, expressed in <span class="yellow">yeast</span>, was located in the nucleus and the nucleolus, suggesting that the function of this protein is conserved.<br><br>MATERIALS AND METHODS
<span class="yellow">Yeast</span> strains and media
The <span class="yellow">S.cerevisiae</span> strains used in this study are all derivatives of a wild-type diploid strain W303 (MATa/MATα ura3-1/ura3-1 leu2-3,112/leu2-3,112 trp1-1/trp1-1 his3-11,15/his3-11,15 ade2-1/ade2-1 can1-100/can1-100) except for strain RS1938. Strain JBY45 (MATa/MATα ENP1/Δenp1::his5+) was constructed by replacing one copy of the ENP1 open reading frame (ORF) with the <span class="yellow">Schizosaccharomyces pombe</span> his5+ gene (18). Strain JBY46 [MATa Δenp1::his5+/pJB23 (ENP1, URA3, CEN6)] is a haploid strain derived from JBY45 with wild-type ENP1 on a low copy number plasmid. Strain JBY48 [MATa Δenp1::his5+/pJB19 (enp1-1, TRP1, CEN6)] and strain JBY49 [MATa Δenp1::his5+/pJB39 (enp1-2, TRP1, CEN6)] have plasmids with enp1 temperature-sensitive (ts) mutations. Strain JBY51 (MATa Δenp1::his5+ TRP1::enp1-1) is an enp1 ts strain generated by integrating the enp1-1 gene at the chromosomal trp1-1 locus. Strain CWY13 [MATa Δenp1::his5+/pJB24 (pMET25-GFP-ENP1, URA3, CEN6)] has GFP-ENP1 under control of the MET25 promoter. Strain CWY14 (MATa ENP1-TAP) was created by fusing sequences encoding a Tandem Affinity Purification (TAP) tag (20,21) to the 3′ end of ENP1. Strain YRH39 (MATα HST2-TAP) was created by fusing sequences encoding a TAP tag to the 3′end of HST2. Strain RS1938 (Δnop1::URA3 pUN100-ProtA-NOP1) was created by transforming RS1935 (MATa/α leu2/leu2 ura3/ura3 lys2/lys2 ade2/ade2 Δnop1::URA3/NOP1) with pUN100-ProtA-NOP1 (strain and plasmid supplied by T. Schafer), followed by tetrad dissection. Strain CWY15 [MATa/pCW109 (pMET25-GFP-hENP1, URA3, CEN6)] has a <span class="yellow">human</span> homolog of Enp1 expressed in W303-1a. The media used were prepared as described (22).<br><br>Cloning of ENP1
pRS426-MEG1 (The original name of ENP1) was a gift from Dr William J. Lennarz. It contains the ENP1 gene within a 2.6 kb EcoRI genomic fragment cloned into pRS426 (18). The EcoRI fragment was subsequently cloned into pRS314 (TRP1, CEN6), pRS316 (URA3, CEN6) and pRS424 (TRP1, 2µ) to create pJB20, pJB23 and pJB21, respectively. pGFP-N-FUS is a centromeric plasmid for fusing green fluorescence protein (GFP) to a polypeptide’s N-terminus under control of the MET25 promoter (23). Cloning the ENP1 ORF into pGFP-N-FUS via XbaI and SalI sites generated plasmid pJB24. pJB19 (enp1-1, TRP1, CEN6) contains the enp1-1 mutant gene. The <span class="yellow">human</span> homolog of <span class="yellow">yeast</span> Enp1 was PCR amplified from a <span class="yellow">human</span> cDNA clone BC007340 (Research Genetics), then cloned into pGFP-N-FUS, p415-ADH, p415-GPD and p415-TEF (24) via XbaI and SalI sites to generate pCW109, pCW113, pCW115 and pCW117, respectively. The fragment of the <span class="yellow">human</span> Enp1 homolog (amino acids 152–437) was also cloned into these vectors to generate pCW110, pCW114, pCW116 and pCW118.<br><br>Random mutagenesis of ENP1 to generate enp1 ts mutants
The enp1 ts mutants were generated with a protocol introducing random mutations by PCR (25). The PCR was performed with oligonucleotides ENP1-MUT5′ (5′-GGTGGTGTCAGT AGGGGA-3′), ENP1-MUT3′ (5′-CAGTCTGCAATATA TGGAC-3′) and plasmid template pJB20 (see above). The nucleotide concentrations in the reaction were 1 mM each for dATP, dGTP, dCTP and dTTP. After strain JBY46 was transformed with the PCR product and with pJB20 gapped by NheI and NsiI, the transformants were replica-plated onto two plates containing 5-FOA synthetic medium without tryptophan; one replica was incubated at 23°C and the other at 37°C. Colonies growing at 23°C but not at 37°C were picked as candidates. Since approximately 10% of the colonies were inviable at both temperatures, we knew that 10% of the ENP1 PCR products lost their function after the PCR mutagenesis. This confirmed the effectiveness of the mutagenesis procedure. Two candidates showed good growth at 23°C but no growth at 37°C. They were named strains JBY48 and JBY49 and contained plasmids with the enp1-1 and enp1-2 mutations, respectively. The mutated enp1-1 gene on pJB19 was cloned into an integration vector, pRS304, as an EcoRI fragment. The plasmid was subsequently linearized with SnaBI within the TRP1 marker and was integrated at the chromosomal trp1-1 locus of strain JBY46. Selection on 5-FOA was used to remove plasmid pJB23, creating strain JBY51.<br><br>Sucrose gradient analysis
Polyribosome preparation and analysis were carried out essentially as described (26). Cells grown in YPD were collected at mid-log phase (OD600 0.8–1.0) and were broken with glass beads. The lysate was frozen immediately in liquid N2 and was stored at –80°C. Lysate (30 U of absorbance at OD260) was layered over a 7–47% (w/v) sucrose gradient, which was centrifuged at 28 000 r.p.m. for 5 h at 4°C in a SW28 rotor and was analyzed with an ISCO UA-5 gradient UV detection system on absorbency at 254 nm.<br><br>Immunofluorescence
Immunofluorescence analysis was carried out essentially as described (27). Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde at room temperature for 1.5 h. Antibodies included a <span class="yellow">mouse</span> monoclonal anti-Nop1 (a gift from John P. Aris, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida) and a Texas-red-conjugated <span class="yellow">donkey</span>-anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> antibody (Jackson Lab), both used at 1:500 dilution. Images were taken on a Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope equipped with a Zeiss AxioCam camera.<br><br>Pulse-chase labeling analysis of rRNA
For [methyl-3H]methionine pulse-chase analysis, cells were grown in synthetic medium without methionine at room temperature or 37°C for 2 h. When the OD600 reached 1.0, 6 ml of the culture were pulse-labeled with 250 µCi [methyl-3H]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia) for 3 min and chased with cold methionine (500 µg/ml) for 2, 4 or 12 min. For each time point of the chase 1.25 ml of culture was mixed with ice and collected. The pellets were frozen immediately in liquid N2 and stored at –80°C before total RNA was purified using a hot phenol method (28). The RNAs were separated on a 1.2% agarose formaldehyde gel and transferred onto Hybond-N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia). After being sprayed with EN3HANCE (Du Pont), the membranes were exposed to film at –80°C (29).<br><br>Northern analysis
Cells were grown inYPD at room temperature or 37°C for 2–4 h. When the OD600 reached 1.0, 10 ml of cells were collected and frozen immediately. Total RNA was extracted as described (28). Five micrograms of RNA were separated on 1.2% agarose formaldehyde gels (for high molecular weight RNA) or on 6% polyacrylamide 7 M urea denaturing gels (for low molecular weight RNA) for each sample. The RNA was then transferred to Zeta-Probe GT nylon membranes (Bio-Rad). Probes for hybridyzation were specific oligonucleotides end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP. After hybridization and washes, membranes were exposed to phosphorimager screens or X-ray films (29). Oligonucleotides specific for various regions of 35S pre-rRNA are: 1, GGTCTCTCTGCTGCCG GAAATG; 3, AATGAGCCATTCGCAGTTTCACTG; 4, GCTCTCATGCTCTTGCCAAAAC; 5, TGTTTGTTACCT CTGGGCCCCG; 6, TCCAGTTACGAAAATTCTTG; 7, CGTATCGCATTTCGCTGCGTTC; 8, GTTCGCCTAGAC GCTCTCTCTTC; 9, GCGAGATTCCCCTACCCAC. The regions complementary to these oligonucleotides are shown in Figure 6A. The oligonucleotides probing box C/D snoRNAs are: U3, TTCGGTTTCTCACTCACTCTGGGGTAC; U14, GGAACCAGTCTTTCATCACCGTG. The oligonucleotides probing box H/ACA snoRNAs are: snoRNA10, CCTTG CAACGGTCCTCATCCGGG; snoRNA30, GTCCGAAGC GCCATCTAGATGA.<br><br>RNA and protein precipitation analysis
Cells were grown in YPD (1 l) to OD600 1.0, then collected, washed once in ice-cold PBS and broken using glass beads in 10 ml IPP150 buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% NP-40) with protease inhibitors. The lysates were mixed with 200 µl IgG agarose beads for 2 h at 4°C. After several washes with 50 ml IPP150 buffer, the IgG beads were collected and the RNA associated with the beads extracted by the hot phenol method (28). One-tenth of the precipitated RNA was then separated on 6% polyacrylamide 7 M urea denaturing gels and electro-transferred to Zeta-Probe GT nylon membranes. They were probed with [γ-32P]ATP labeled oligonucleotides. For the lanes showing total RNA, 2 µg RNA prepared from exponentially growing cultures were loaded. For co-precipitation analysis of proteins, the IgG beads were resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min and separated by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Approximately 1% of the precipitate was loaded onto each lane. For the total protein, 0.1% of the extract prior to precipitation was loaded onto each lane. Following electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and detected using anti-Nop1 antibody at 1:3000 dilution (provided by J. Aris) and anti-L3 antibody (provided by J. Warner) at 1:3000 dilution followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> secondary antibody at 1:5000 dilution. The antibody complexes were detected using ECL-Plus reagents (Amersham Pharmacia) as specified by the manufacturer.<br><br>
RESULTS
Construction and analysis of ENP1 temperature-sensitive alleles
ENP1 is an essential <span class="yellow">yeast</span> gene conserved among eukaryotes (18). To study its functions, we first created a diploid strain, JBY45, heterozygous for the Δenp1 mutation. Then two enp1 ts mutant alleles (enp1-1 and enp1-2) were generated by random PCR mutagenesis, as described in Materials and Methods. Both mutant alleles were recessive to the wild-type ENP1 gene. The enp1-1 gene was integrated into the chromosomal trp1-1 locus to create strain JBY51 and all subsequent experiments were done with this enp1 allele. At 23°C the growth of JBY51 was comparable to that of W303-1a (ENP1), but at 37°C it did not grow (Fig. 2). Sequence analysis revealed that enp1-1 contains two point mutations, resulting in substitutions of two amino acids: W242→G and V415→A. No attempt was made to determine whether both mutations were required for the ts phenotype. Flow cytometry of strain JBY51 showed DNA content profiles similar to those of the wild-type strain at the non-permissive temperature (data not shown), suggesting that ENP1 is not involved in cell cycle regulation.<br><br>Enp1 is enriched in the nucleolus
Enp1 tagged at the C-terminus with the myc epitope was previously found to localize to the nucleus (18). To expand this analysis, we fused GFP to the N-terminus of Enp1, and expressed the tagged Enp1 protein under control of the MET25 promoter as the sole source of Enp1 protein in the cells. Cells of strain CWY13 (pMET25-GFP-ENP1) were grown in media with methionine (transcription partially repressed) or without methionine (transcription not repressed). Growth of CWY13 was comparable to that of wild-type cells in both media (data not shown), indicating that the GFP tagged Enp1 protein was functional. In cells cultured in medium without methionine, in which the ENP transcription was not repressed, the GFP-Enp1 protein was expressed at a high level and showed strong green fluorescence distributed throughout the nucleus (data not shown), consistent with the original observation (18). With methionine added to the medium, however, the fluorescent signal of GFP-Enp1 was weaker and surprisingly showed crescent or cap-like patterns typical of nucleolar proteins (Fig. 3A). This nucleolar enrichment was confirmed by its co-localization with the nucleolar protein Nop1 (Fig. 3B).<br><br>ENP1 mutation leads to reduced levels of 40S ribosomal subunits
The nucleolar enrichment suggested that Enp1 might play some role in ribosome synthesis. To test this possibility, cells of W303-1a (ENP1), JBY51 (enp1-1) and a top2 ts strain RS191 (30) were grown in YPD at 23 or 37°C and their ribosome profiles analyzed after separation on sucrose gradients. At 23°C, enp1-1 cells showed polysome profiles similar to those of the wild-type and top2-1 strains (Fig. 4A–C). In contrast, after incubation at the non-permissive temperature (37°C) for 40 min (data not shown) and 2 h, enp1-1 cells had reduced levels of 40S ribosomal subunits, 80S monosomes and polysomes, along with a dramatic increase in the free 60S subunit peak (Fig. 4F), while the wild-type and top2-1 cells showed little change in polysome profile at 37°C (Fig. 4D and E). These results demonstrate that the changes of the enp1-1 polysome profile were due to specific defects caused by the enp1-1 mutation, and not due simply to the shift to 37°C for a wild-type or ts strain.<br><br>The processing of pre-rRNA for 18S rRNA is impaired in enp1 mutants
In most cases reductions in ribosomal subunit levels are the results of defects in pre-rRNA processing or ribosome assembly or both (3). To study the mechanism by which Enp1 affects the 40S subunit, we analyzed the effects of enp1 mutations on processing of the pre-rRNA using pulse-chase labeling. [methyl-3H]methionine is preferred for labeling rRNAs in pulse-chase analysis because rRNAs are specifically methylated during the early steps of the processing. Cells of W303-1a (ENP1) and JBY51 (enp1-1) were grown at 23 or 37°C for 2 h before they were labeled with [methyl-3H]methionine for 3 min and chased with cold methionine for 2, 4 and 12 min. In wild-type cells, the labeled 35S rRNA precursor, 27S and 20S rRNA intermediates were rapidly chased into mature 25S and 18S rRNAs (Fig. 5), at 23 or 37°C. In contrast, enp1-1 cells showed dramatic changes after incubation at 37°C. Although at 23°C the synthesis and processing were comparable to those of wild-type cells, cells cultured at 37°C for 2 h had neither 20S pre-rRNA nor 18S rRNA, while 25S rRNA was generated at normal levels. The 37°C grown enp1-1 cells also had low levels of aberrant 23S and possibly 21S intermediates (Fig. 5). The defect in 18S rRNA synthesis was further supported by pulse-chase experiments carried out using [5,6-3H]uracil. The results obtained were essentially the same; no 20S pre-rRNA or 18S rRNA was produced, while processing to 25S rRNA was not affected (data not shown).
Taken together, these results suggested that the enp1 mutation leads to specific defects in the processing pathway for 20S pre-rRNA and 18S rRNA, resulting in reduced 40S subunit synthesis and a lowered level of the 40S subunit.<br><br>Enp1 is required for pre-rRNA processing at A0, A1 and A2 sites
To define the processing steps affected by the enp1 mutation, the steady state levels of rRNA precursors and mature RNAs were analyzed by northern blotting. Total RNAs were isolated from cells of W303-1a (ENP1) and JBY51 (enp1-1) grown at 37°C for 2 or 4 h. After separation on formaldehyde agarose, RNAs were transferred onto nylon membranes and probed with radiolabeled oligonucleotides specific to various regions of the 35S pre-rRNA (Fig. 6A). After incubation at 37°C, enp1-1 cells had wild-type levels of 25S rRNA, but reduced levels of 18S rRNA (Fig. 6B). A probe specific to ITS1 (P5) further revealed that enp1-1 cells incubated at the non-permissive temperature accumulated two aberrant rRNAs, 23S and 21S (Fig. 6C). Aberrant rRNA processing products of similar sizes have been described in numerous studies (14,31–34) and result from defects in processing at A0, A1 and A2. Additional probes were used to verify the origins of the 23S and 21S RNAs in the enp1-1 strain. The 23S product was detected by oligos 1, 2, 4 and 5, but not by oligos 6, 7 or 8 (Fig. 6D, E, C, F, G and data not shown). Thus this RNA extends from the 5′ end of the 35S rRNA to the A3 site. The 21S product was detected by oligos 4 and 5, but not by oligos 1, 2, 6, 7 and 8 (Fig. 6E, C, D, F, G and data not shown), indicating that it extends from the A1 to the A3 site. At 37°C the enp1-1 cells also had less 32S and 20S rRNA intermediates (Fig. 6B and E). These results suggest that the enp1 mutation led to complete or nearly complete inhibition of processing at site A0 and A2, and partial inhibition of processing at site A1. As a consequence, the 35S pre-rRNA was cleaved at site A3 instead, producing 23S and 21S rRNA products. Consistent with this theory, the 27SA2 rRNA intermediate level was greatly reduced in enp1 cells at 37°C (Fig. 6C) due to the inhibition of processing at A2, while the 27SB pre-rRNA level was similar to wild-type cells (Fig. 6G). Moreover, no difference in the 5.8 rRNA level was observed between the wild-type cells and enp1 cells (Fig. 6H).<br><br>Enp1 is associated with U3 and U14 snoRNAs and with Nop1
It has previously been shown that mutations in the U3, U14, snR10 and snR30 snoRNAs and in their associated proteins affect processing of 35S pre-rRNA at A0, A1 and A2. Because of the similarity with the processing defects of enp1-1 strains, we tested the association between Enp1 and snoRNAs. To do this, we created a strain in which a TAP tag was fused to the C-terminus of Enp1. The TAP tag contains <span class="yellow">Staphylococcus aureus</span> Protein A as well as calmodulin-binding peptide sequences, so the tagged Enp1 binds IgG beads with high specificity. Cells grew well with the TAP-tagged Enp1 as the only source of Enp1 protein, showing that it was functional. As a control, we used a TAP tag on an unrelated cytoplasmic protein, Hst2. Strain CWY14 (ENP1-TAP) and the Hst2-TAP tagged strain were grown in YPD to mid-exponential phase before being harvested. Extracts were prepared and mixed with IgG agarose beads to precipitate Enp1-TAP and associated RNAs. Total RNAs were extracted from washed IgG beads, separated on 6% polyacrylamide denaturing gels, transferred to nylon membranes and probed with radiolabeled oligonucleotides. Northern analysis revealed that Enp1-TAP precipitates were enriched with U3 and U14 snoRNAs relative to precipitates from the Hst2-tagged strain (Fig. 7A). The Enp1-TAP samples were not enriched with snR30 snoRNA (Fig. 7A), nor with U24 or U18 snoRNAs (data not shown). We found no change in the levels of U3, U14, snR10 and snR30 snoRNAs in the enp1 mutant, indicating that the mutation did not affect snoRNAs levels (Fig. 6I). The results indicate that Enp1 associates in vivo with U3 and U14 snoRNAs. Much less U3 RNA co-immunoprecipitated with Enp1-TAP than with Protein A-tagged Nop1, which is known to associate with U3 and U14 snoRNAs (Fig. 7A). However, Protein A-Nop1 was much more efficiently precipitated than was the Enp1-TAP protein (data not shown). Therefore, it is likely that similar amounts of RNAs are associated with the two proteins and that the proteins are part of the same complex. To address this further, we checked for the presence of Nop1 in the Enp1-TAP immunoprecipitates. Figure 7B shows that Nop1 indeed is in the Enp1 precipitate but not in the Hst2 control, whereas an abundant ribosomal protein, L3, is in neither precipitate.
U3 and U14 snoRNAs have been shown to interact with rRNA precursors and these interactions are required for pre-rRNA processing (35–37). Using an in vitro system, U3 was also shown to be associated with its rRNA substrate and processing product (38). This raised the possibility that Enp1 might also be associated with rRNAs since its function in rRNA processing appeared linked to those of U3 and U14 snoRNAs. To test this possibility, we further analyzed the RNAs that co-precipiate with TAP-tagged Enp1. The RNAs were separated on 1.2% agarose formaldehyde gels or on polyacrylamide denaturing gels, transferred to nylon membranes and probed with radiolabeled oligonucleotides for pre-rRNAs. A probe (P4; see Fig. 6) specific to 20s and its precursors revealed that pre-rRNAs 35S, 33S, 32S and 20S specifically co-precipitated with Enp1-TAP (Fig. 7C). No such enrichment was found using a probe (P8; see Fig. 6) specific for 27S RNAs or a probe for 5.8S RNA (Fig. 7C). These results clearly demonstrated that Enp1 is associated with substrates and products of the early steps of 18S rRNA processing.<br><br>Comparison of Enp1 with homologs in other organisms
Homologs of Enp1 protein in <span class="yellow">human</span>, <span class="blue">Drosophila</span> and <span class="yellow">Caenorhabditis elegans</span> have been reported (18). A previously described <span class="yellow">human</span> homolog, bystin, was only 306 amino acids in length, and lacked sequences corresponding to the N-terminal 163 amino acids of <span class="yellow">yeast</span> Enp1 (19). In contrast, we identified a <span class="yellow">human</span> expressed sequence tag (EST), BC007340 in a Blast search that revealed an ORF of 1311 nucleotides encoding a 437 amino acid polypeptide (39). Comparison of this 437 amino acid polypeptide with <span class="yellow">human</span> bystin (19) showed that they were encoded by the same gene on <span class="yellow">human</span> chromosome 6. The reported sequence for <span class="yellow">human</span> bystin is a fragment of the 437 amino acid <span class="yellow">human</span> Enp1 protein, due to a truncated cDNA sequence. Also, a sequence discrepancy at the C-terminus is due to inaccurate DNA sequence of the <span class="yellow">human</span> bystin, as confirmed by available <span class="yellow">human</span> genome and EST sequences. Searches of the database of other organisms identified Enp1 homologs in <span class="yellow">S.pombe</span>, <span class="yellow">Arabidopsis thaliana</span>, <span class="yellow">C.elegans</span>, <span class="yellow">Drosophila melanogaster</span> and <span class="yellow">mouse</span>. The alignment of the homologs showed that they shared homology from the N-terminus to the C-terminus, with the C-terminal half extremely well conserved, with close to 90% similarity (Fig. 8). One interesting observation is that the two amino acids changed in the enp1-1 mutant, W242 and V415, are conserved among all homologs.
The <span class="yellow">human</span> Enp1 homolog was cloned and expressed in <span class="yellow">yeast</span> and tested for function. Expressed under the control of ADH, TEF or GPD promoter, the <span class="yellow">human</span> Enp1 homolog did not complement a <span class="yellow">yeast</span> enp1 null mutant. However, a GFP fusion to the N-terminus of <span class="yellow">human</span> Enp1 homolog localized to the nucleus and was enriched in the nucleolus (data not shown).<br><br>
DISCUSSION
ENP1 is a <span class="yellow">yeast</span> gene first identified in a genetic screen for complementation of mutations in ost4, which encodes a subunit of oligosaccharide transferase (17), although subsequent work showed that it is unlikely that Enp1 has any connection to oligosaccharide transferase (18). ENP1 was shown to be essential for viability and the Enp1 protein localized to the nucleus (18).
When we re-examined the localization of Enp1, we observed that the protein was enriched in the nucleolus. This finding led us to test for a role of Enp1 in ribosome synthesis. Using an enp1 ts mutant, we found that depletion of Enp1 caused a 40S ribosomal subunit deficiency. Further analysis revealed that this deficiency was not due to a change of the subunit’s stability, but to a defect in the synthesis of the subunit’s 18S rRNA component. Pulse-chase analysis of RNA synthesis in an enp1-1 strain revealed that no 20S pre-rRNA or 18S rRNA was made at the non-permissive temperature, while levels of 25S rRNA appeared normal. Low levels of precursors to 18S rRNA were detected in the mutants, and they were extremely unstable. Northern analysis of steady state RNA levels demonstrated that the enp1 mutation specifically inhibited the pre-rRNA early cleavages at sites A0, A1 and A2, which are required for the production of the 20S pre-rRNA and the 18S rRNA. These defects of the enp1 mutation on rRNA processing are very similar to those caused by mutation of KRR1, another essential nucleolar gene required for synthesis of the 40S, but not the 60S subunit (40).
Co-precipitation analyses provided strong evidence that Enp1 is directly involved in pre-rRNA processing. In these experiments, TAP-tagged Enp1 bound to IgG beads specifically co-precipitated with two snoRNAs, U3 and U14, and with the 35S, 33S, 32S and 20S pre-rRNAs. Among the more than 100 snoRNAs in <span class="yellow">yeast</span> cells, U3, U14, snR10, snR30 and MRP RNA are the only ones required for rRNA processing. It has been shown that mutations in U3, U14, snR10 and snR30 snoRNAs and protein components of the snoRNPs affect processing at sites A0, A1 or A2 (15,16,41,42). Enp1’s interaction with U3 and U14 snoRNAs suggests that Enp1’s function in rRNA processing involves these two snoRNAs. The fact that the nucleolar protein, Nop1, known to bind to U3 and U14 RNAs, also was found in the Enp1 precipitate, provides additional evidence that Enp1 is part of a complex involved in processing of rRNA. Recently, a genome-wide study of <span class="yellow">yeast</span> protein complexes, using a TAP tag method similar to ours, reported a number of proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with Enp1 (43). These proteins included Imp4, Kre31, Kre33, Mpp10, Nop1, Nop14 and Sof1, all of which have been implicated in 18S RNA processing or 40S biogenesis. Very recently (after the studies in this manuscript were concluded) Grandi et al. published an analysis of components of the 90s preribosomal particle, which include the 35S pre-rRNA, U3 snoRNP and rRNA processing factors for the 40S subunit (44). In agreement with our findings, they found that Enp1 is a component of this 90s complex and also of a smaller complex containing the 20S pre-rRNA. Surprisingly, none of the other proteins involved in processing of pre-rRNAs that were tested associated with the 20S rRNA, suggesting that those proteins, but not Enp1, are released prior to 20S pre-rRNA formation (44). The authors also showed co-precipitation of Enp1 with dimethylated 20S pre-rRNA, which is formed after export of 20S to the cytoplasm. These results of Grandi et al. suggest that Enp1 may also be involved in later steps of processing or nuclear export.
A previous study on the Enp1 <span class="yellow">human</span> homolog, bystin, reported that the protein was localized in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells and might be involved in cell adhesion (19). Our discovery of the 437 amino acid <span class="yellow">human</span> Enp1 homolog revealed that the bystin studied previously was from a truncated library cDNA encoding only the C-terminal 306 amino acids. Although the <span class="yellow">human</span> homolog of Enp1 did not complement a <span class="yellow">yeast</span> Δenp1 mutant, we did show that it was localized to the nucleus and enriched in the nucleolus (data not shown). This strongly suggests that the conserved function of Enp1 is in rRNA processing. The cytoplasmic localization of bystin and its proposed function in cell adhesion are unlikely to reflect the actual function of the <span class="yellow">human</span> Enp1 homolog.
It will be important to study the nature of the associations between Enp1 and U3 and U14 snoRNPs, and to learn more about the exact role of Enp1 in ribosomal RNA processing.<br><br>
<h3>pmcA1937013</h3>Dynein Modifiers in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>: Light Chains Suppress Conditional Heavy Chain Mutants
Abstract
Cytoplasmic dynein is a microtubule-dependent motor protein that functions in mitotic cells during centrosome separation, metaphase chromosome congression, anaphase spindle elongation, and chromosome segregation. Dynein is also utilized during interphase for vesicle transport and organelle positioning. While numerous cellular processes require cytoplasmic dynein, the mechanisms that target and regulate this microtubule motor remain largely unknown. By screening a conditional <span class="yellow">Caenorhabditis elegans</span> cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain mutant at a semipermissive temperature with a genome-wide RNA interference library to reduce gene functions, we have isolated and characterized twenty dynein-specific suppressor genes. When reduced in function, these genes suppress dynein mutants but not other conditionally mutant loci, and twelve of the 20 specific suppressors do not exhibit sterile or lethal phenotypes when their function is reduced in wild-type <span class="yellow">worms</span>. Many of the suppressor proteins, including two dynein light chains, localize to subcellular sites that overlap with those reported by others for the dynein heavy chain. Furthermore, knocking down any one of four putative dynein accessory chains suppresses the conditional heavy chain mutants, suggesting that some accessory chains negatively regulate heavy chain function. We also identified 29 additional genes that, when reduced in function, suppress conditional mutations not only in dynein but also in loci required for unrelated essential processes. In conclusion, we have identified twenty genes that in many cases are not essential themselves but are conserved and when reduced in function can suppress conditionally lethal <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain mutants. We conclude that conserved but nonessential genes contribute to dynein function during the essential process of mitosis.
Microtubules and microtubule-dependent motor proteins segregate chromosomes during mitosis and also promote cellular organization in nondividing cells. An essential motor protein complex called cytoplasmic dynein powers many aspects of microtubule-dependent transport, but it is currently unclear how dynein is regulated such that it can execute different processes. We have performed a genome-wide screen to isolate genes that are involved in dynein-dependent processes. We determined that 20 of the 49 genes we identified specifically influenced the viability of dynein mutant strains but not the viability of other <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> mutants. Many of the proteins that specifically influence dynein localized to subcellular sites where the dynein heavy chain has been reported by others to be found. Additionally, we identified four dynein components that appear to negatively regulate the force-generating dynein heavy chain. The identification and initial characterization of this group of genes represents a route to identify genes that are not themselves essential but do participate in essential processes.<br><br><br><br>Introduction
The microtubule motor called cytoplasmic dynein has roles in diverse cellular processes including meiotic and mitotic spindle assembly and function, neuronal transport, and organelle positioning [1]. Cytoplasmic dynein is composed of a dimer of heavy chains (HCs), along with several accessory chains (ACs: intermediate, light intermediate, and light chains). Other dynein-interacting proteins, such as dynactin and LIS1, are likely present at substoichiometric levels and further modulate dynein function. The HCs contain both ATPase and microtubule binding activities and are sufficient for microtubule-based motility in vitro, moving toward the minus, or slow-growing, end of microtubules [2]. The dynein ACs provide cargo docking sites and often are encoded by multigene families in any one species [reviewed in 1,3]. In <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>, a single gene called dhc-1 encodes a cytoplasmic dynein 1 HC, while 11 other genes encode five classes of predicted dynein ACs [3,4].
The early <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> embryo is an excellent system for investigating gene contributions for essential cellular processes, including cytoskeletal functions [5]. The <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> dynein HC DHC-1 is essential and required for multiple microtubule-dependent events during early embryogenesis [6–9]. Depletion of DHC-1 by RNA interference (RNAi) in early <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> embryos produces defects in female meiotic divisions, migration of the oocyte and sperm pronuclei after fertilization, and centrosome separation during mitotic spindle assembly [6]. Analysis of fast-acting dhc-1 temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants has further revealed that dynein is required for chromosome congression to the metaphase plate during mitosis, as well as for mitotic spindle positioning [10].
While many requirements for cytoplasmic dynein are known, our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that target and regulate dynein remains limited. Clearly, the multiple ACs can couple the dynein HC to particular substrates [11], including vesicles, nuclei, viruses, kinetochores, and rhodopsin [see table in 1]. However, reducing the function of only four of the eleven dynein ACs in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> produces lethal phenotypes [12]. Thus, it remains unclear how ACs influence the different essential requirements for dynein. Another potential route for dynein regulation involves the phosphorylation state of the different dynein chains, which in some cases confers distinctive functional properties to the motor. While many examples of dynein phosphorylation exist, and cell cycle dependent changes in phosphorylation have been described [13–15], few if any studies have demonstrated a requirement for such modification during mitosis. Large-scale forward genetic screens have identified genes with requirements similar to those for dynein, but many of these encode core components of the microtubule cytoskeleton and few are known to directly influence dynein itself [12,16]. Genes that do influence dynein function might also have other essential roles, leading to pleiotropic mutant phenotypes that obscure their relationship to dynein [17–19]. Moreover, redundancy within the multigene dynein subunit families, and also perhaps between the different ACs, may complicate the identification of single gene requirements that are important for dynein function. Thus far, reducing the function of individual genes has not provided substantial insight into the mechanisms that regulate and mediate the many different requirements for cytoplasmic dynein during mitosis.
To identify potential regulators of cytoplasmic dynein, we have used a sensitized genetic background to conduct a genome-wide screen for modifiers of dynein function in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>. Other groups have successfully used RNAi modifier screens to identify genes that function in particular pathways [20–23]; we have used RNAi to screen for genes that, when reduced in function, suppress the embryonic lethality associated with a temperature-sensitive (ts) allele of the dhc-1 dynein HC gene. Using the dhc-1ts genetic background, we found 49 genes that, when depleted, suppress the partial loss of HC function. Twenty of these genes suppress conditional dynein HC mutants but not other conditional mutants with unrelated defects. Finally, we show that some of these dynein-specific suppressors encode proteins that may overlap with the dynein HC in subcellular localization.<br><br>Results
To identify dynein suppressors, we used three different conditional and recessive dhc-1 mutants that were identified previously [7]. These ts alleles of dhc-1 (or195, or283, and or352) produce similar defects at the restrictive temperature of 26 °C, including incomplete mitotic spindle assembly in one-cell embryos and embryonic lethality [7]. We sequenced the dhc-1 locus in the three mutants. The independently isolated or195 and or283 alleles each change a conserved serine to leucine at codon 3200, within the coiled-coil region of the microtubule-binding stalk domain (Figure 1A and 1C). The or352 allele replaces a conserved glycine with aspartic acid at codon 2158, in the ATP-binding walker A motif of the second AAA ATPase domain (Figure 1B and 1C). As both missense mutations affect conserved residues, they may prove useful for engineering ts alleles in other organisms. The temperature versus viability curves of the dynein ts mutants feature a steep central transition zone ideal for modifier screening because subtle changes in temperature produce large changes in embryonic viability (Figure 2A).
To identify genes that, when reduced in function, can suppress conditional dhc-1 mutants, we developed a high-throughput RNAi-based screen (Figure 2B). To reduce gene function we used a library of 16,757 bacterial strains that each express a dsRNA corresponding to exon-rich gene sequences [17,19]. We then tested over 99% of the bacterial strains in this library for RNAi-mediated suppression of dhc-1(or195) embryonic lethality at 23 °C, after raising synchronized L1 larvae to adulthood on dsRNA-expressing bacterial lawns in 48-well agar plates. This screening procedure should work to identify nonessential and essential suppressor genes, because RNAi does not always fully reduce gene function [24,25], and even if RNAi does produce lethality, cosuppression could restore viability. Nevertheless, essential genes may be missed due to earlier requirements that produce strong larval arrest, sterile, or embryonic lethal phenotypes.
Using this screening procedure, we identified 49 bacterial clones that consistently increased embryonic viability at the semipermissive temperature. The dsRNA-producing plasmids were then sequenced to verify gene identity. Quantification of embryonic viability using dhc-1(or195) animals showed that the RNAi-mediated depletion of suppressor gene function increased viability to 5%–100%, compared to less than 2% in unsuppressed controls (Figure 3A; Table S1). The proteins encoded by the suppressor genes we identified are summarized in Figure 4.
As a more direct assay for dynein activity in the suppressed dhc-1 embryos, we measured spindle length and cytokinesis success: dhc-1 mutant embryos have severe spindle assembly defects and subsequent cytokinesis failures [6,7,10]. We shifted dhc-1 adult hermaphrodites from 23 °C to the fully restrictive temperature of 26 °C for 3–5 hours and made time-lapse video micrographs using Nomarski optics to monitor the first embryonic cell division. This procedure results in dhc-1(or195) embryos with P0 spindles 30% the length of wild-type spindles (Figure S1). In the suppressed dhc-1(or195) backgrounds, spindle lengths ranged from 30%–83% of wild-type lengths (Figure S1). Similarly, cytokinesis failed in unsuppressed dhc-1(or195) embryos 89% of the time, but most of the suppressors rescued this phenotype (Figure S1). These results indicate that most of the suppressors influence dynein-dependent cellular processes, as expected given their ability to restore viability when reduced in function.
Specificity of Suppression
Because RNAi can reduce the function of unintended targets (so-called “off-target effects” [26,27]), we also used available mutations in some of the suppressor genes we identified to reduce their function. We constructed double mutant strains using dhc-1(or195) and viable deletion alleles for two suppressor genes, dylt-1(ok417) and ufd-2(tm1380), and examined embryonic viability (Figure 3B). The deletion alleles of dylt-1 (encoding a Tctex1-type dynein light chain), and ufd-2 (encoding a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme) both recapitulated the suppression produced by RNAi knockdown (Figure 3B). The dpy-3(e27) and dpy-10(e128) point mutation alleles [28] also suppressed embryonic lethality in double mutants (Figure 3B). Based on this small sampling, and because RNAi in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> appears to be highly gene specific in the absence of close paralogs [12,19], we conclude that many of the suppressors we have identified will prove to be suppressor locus specific. The dsRNA-expressing bacterial clones we used to deplete two of the dynein suppressors (tag-300 and ZK1127.10) probably also knock down expression of one close paralog for each locus [29].
We next asked whether the suppressors are specific for dynein function or if their depletion more generally stabilizes ts proteins. We tested for specificity using two conditional mutants with cell fate patterning defects unrelated to dynein function, lit-1(or131) and spn-4(or191). The lit-1 gene encodes a MAP kinase-related protein [30], while spn-4 encodes a protein with an RNA binding motif [31]. We found that ten of the dhc-1-interacting genes significantly increased embryonic viability in both lit-1 and spn-4 mutants, while 18 others suppressed one or the other of these two conditional mutants when reduced in function using the same RNAi protocol as that used for dhc-1ts mutants (Figure 4, right two columns; Table S1). Therefore, about half of the suppressors appear to act nonspecifically on multiple ts mutants to restore embryonic viability. From here on, we will refer to the suppressors that only acted on dhc-1, and not on lit-1 and spn-4 ts mutants, as dynein-specific suppressors.
Because many ts mutations exert their effect via protein assembly or unfolding mechanisms [32], suppressor genes reduced in function by RNAi might not be expected to exhibit allele specificity with most ts mutations. To determine if the dynein suppressors are either allele or strain specific, we tested the two other conditional dhc-1 strains (containing the or283 and or352 alleles). Although the or283 allele is identical to or195, it provides a useful control for the presence of background mutations because the two strains were isolated independently. In most cases, depletion of the dynein-specific suppressors also restored viability to the other two ts dhc-1 alleles. Y40B1B.5, a putative translation initiation factor, suppressed only one conditional dhc-1 strain, and we consider this as an example of a nonspecific interaction (Figure 4, left three columns; Table S1). Two dsRNAs that do not suppress lit-1 or spn-4 mutants produced suppression in the dhc-1(or195) and dhc-1(or283) strains, but not in the dhc-1(or352) strain, perhaps indicating allele specificity or variability in the RNAi treatments. We conclude that strain background differences are relatively rare, and that the majority of the suppressors are allele-independent. To summarize, we have identified 20 genes that when reduced in function specifically suppress multiple dynein ts strains but not unrelated ts loci.<br><br>Survey of Putative Dynein Accessory Chains
We were surprised to discover that depleting two predicted dynein ACs specifically suppressed the partial loss of HC function, because most dynein accessory subunits are presumed to promote dynein function by aiding dynein complex formation or mediating cargo attachment [3,11,33]. Depletion of either dylt-1 (encoding a Tctex1-type light chain) or dyrb-1 (encoding a roadblock-type light chain) suppressed embryonic lethality in all three ts dynein HC mutant strains (Figure 4). To extend this observation, we surveyed all genes encoding predicted dynein components for suppression of the three ts dhc-1 mutants (Figure 5A; Table S2). We reasoned that some dynein subunit genes could have been missed in the primary screening and several dynein AC genes were not represented in the <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> RNAi library. After using RNAi to reduce their function, we found that one of three Tctex1 homologs (dylt-1), one of four LC8 homologs (dlc-1), one of two light intermediate chains (dli-1), as well as the sole roadblock homolog (dyrb-1) each strongly suppressed the three conditional dynein mutants. Lower-level suppression was also seen for the second light intermediate chain, xbx-1, when its function was reduced. Thus, one gene of each of four subunit classes restores viability to the three dhc-1 mutant strains when depleted by RNAi.
The only subunit class not found to suppress was the intermediate chain, encoded by a single gene in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>, dyci-1. When reduced in function by RNAi, dyci-1 produces a larval arrest phenotype like that observed for dhc-1(RNAi); this phenotype precludes any suppression of the conditional embryonic lethality (shown as “la” in Figure 5A). In contrast, knockdown of either dlc-1 or dli-1 suppresses embryonic lethality in the dhc-1ts mutants, even though reducing their function in otherwise wild-type embryos produces dhc-1-like defects, including embryonic lethality [12,34] (see Figure 5B and Discussion). The suppressing cytoplasmic dynein subunits and DYCI-1 are shown in a putative complex in Figure 5E.
We performed several genetic assays to better understand how the suppressor genes may be operating. First, suppression of dhc-1 lethality by reducing AC function may indicate that our dhc-1 alleles express a neomorphic and toxic DHC-1 protein: if the suppressor dynein AC subunits positively function in dynein processes, depleting them might suppress any neomorphic effects. This explanation is perhaps unlikely, because the dhc-1ts alleles are all recessive, but remained a possibility in dhc-1 homozygotes. We therefore reduced dynein function using RNAi in animals that had passed through the larval arrest points for dhc-1(RNAi) and dyci-1(RNAi). Specifically, we transferred dhc-1(or195) L4 hermaphrodites to plates with bacteria expressing dhc-1 or dyci-1 dsRNA. As control we performed dylt-1(RNAi) using the same procedure. We observed substantial suppression with dylt-1 in this assay, but we saw no suppression with the heavy or intermediate chains (Figure 5C). This suggests that the DHC-1ts protein is not toxic and that dyci-1 acts more like dhc-1 than the other suppressing ACs because it does not suppress the heavy chain mutant.
To further examine the nature of the AC suppression, we asked if depletion of the suppressor chains could bypass the requirement for dhc-1. We transferred wild-type L4 larvae to plates with bacteria expressing dsRNA corresponding to both the suppressor ACs and dhc-1. We did not observe any suppression in these double RNAi assays (Figure 5D), suggesting that dhc-1ts suppression requires the residual activity of the defective DHC-1 protein. We conclude that the dynein AC suppressors inhibit or somehow oppose the function of the DHC-1ts protein, and that the dhc-1(or195ts) mutation does not produce a toxic gene product but simply reduces DHC-1 activity to a low, but non-null, level.<br><br>Localization of the Dynein Suppressor Proteins
To further explore how the suppressor proteins function, we examined the subcellular localization of nine of them as stably expressed N-terminal GFP::S fusions. We chose to first focus on the suppressor genes that were conserved but poorly characterized in any system, or were conserved but uncharacterized during early <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> embryogenesis. Prior dynein immunocytochemistry-based localization studies serve as a comparison [6,10,35]. As in other species, <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> DHC-1 is associated with mitotic spindles, centrosomes, the nuclear envelope, the cell cortex, the midbody, and throughout the cytoplasm. Most of the suppressor proteins we examined localized to sites where DHC-1 is known to act or localize (Figure 6). However, the nearly ubiquitous distribution of DHC-1 in early embryonic cells makes colocalization likely but not necessarily meaningful, and biochemical studies are needed to conclusively address any direct or indirect physical associations.
Four suppressor GFP fusion proteins localized to nuclear membranes and to spindle poles or pericentrosomal regions. The DYLT-1 and DYRB-1 dynein light chains were associated with nuclear envelopes and centrosomes, as well as meiotic and mitotic spindle poles (Figure 6A–6H; Videos S1 and S2). The potential coiled-coil protein K04F10.3 was present on the nuclear envelope and in a pericentrosomal position during mitosis, similar to endoplasmic reticulum proteins [36] (Figure 6I–6L; Video S3). K04F10.3 was also highly enriched at meiotic spindle poles (Figure 6I), which has been observed for other endoplasmic reticulum proteins [36]. The NPP-22 transmembrane nucleoporin was found at nuclear envelopes (Figure 6M–6P; Video S4), as previously reported for later stage embryos [37], and it also surrounded centrosomes during mitosis. Two splice isoforms of the pleckstrin homology domain–containing EFA-6/Y55D9A.1, an ARF guanine nucleotide exchange factor, were enriched cortically both in the anterior portion of the one-cell zygote and at the blastomere boundary in two-cell embryos (Figure 6Q–6T; Videos S5 and S6). The conserved Mo25 homolog MOP-25.2/Y53C12A.4 was found enriched in a single spot after cytokinesis that appears to correspond to the midbody (Figure 6U–6X; Video S7). F10E7.8, a highly conserved ortholog of <span class="yellow">S. cerevisiae</span> Far11, appears nuclear (Figure 6Y–6B′ and Video S8). Finally, the nonspecific suppressor protein STAR-2, a predicted RNA binding protein, appears to be associated with P-granules (like its homolog GLD-1), where dynein is neither localized nor known to function (Figure 6C′–6F′).<br><br>DLYT-1 and DYRB-1: Dynein Light Chain Localization
The <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> dynein HC protein weakly localizes to spindle poles during early embryonic cell cycles [6,10], and so did DYRB-1 and DYLT-1 (Videos S9 and S10). However, ts mutant forms of the DHC-1 protein (including DHC-1 encoded by the or195 allele) strongly localize to centrosomes when shifted to the non-permissive temperature [10]. The mechanism underlying this enhanced localization is not known, but it may represent trapping of the defective protein at a normally transient location. We exploited this behavior of the mutant DHC-1 protein to determine whether redistribution of the putative DYRB-1 and DYLT-1 dynein light chains also occurred in the dhc-1(or195) background.
We found that the cellular distributions of DYRB-1 and DYLT-1 were dramatically altered in dhc-1(or195) mutant embryos. After shifting the parental <span class="yellow">worms</span> to the restrictive temperature for 3–5 h prior to collecting embryos, these two proteins were prominently localized to centrosomes and to spindle poles that did not separate in one-cell stage embryos (Figure 7; Videos S11 and S12). The spindle pole to cytoplasmic fluorescence ratio during late anaphase was 5-fold higher in both of the dhc-1 homozygous mutant strains when compared to wild-type embryos expressing the GFP fusions. We also assayed localization of the two putative dynein light chains after short temperature shifts to the nonpermissive temperature in the dhc-1(or195) mutant background, which yields mitotic spindles with an overall wild-type appearance and function. These short temperature shifts also resulted in robust localization of these two dynein light chains to centrosomes (unpublished data). Finally, we examined the localization of GFP::DYRB-1 and GFP::DYLT-1 in embryos from dhc-1(or195) −/+ <span class="yellow">worms</span> grown at the dhc-1(or195) permissive temperature of 15 °C. Even though embryos from mothers heterozygous for this recessive mutation are viable and develop normally, even at 26 °C [7], we observed a substantial increase in both GFP fusion proteins at the mitotic spindle poles in early embryos (Figure 7; Videos S13 and S14). Importantly, localization of DYLT-1 and DYRB-1 to centrosomes does not occur in embryos depleted for DHC-1 with RNAi (our unpublished results), indicating that these proteins require the mutant DHC-1 polypeptide for centrosomal targeting in the dhc-1(or195) embryos. In summary, the DYRB-1 and DYLT-1 proteins localize to sites where the DHC-1 HC is also found in wild-type embryos, and all three proteins respond similarly to mutational alterations in DHC-1.<br><br>Genetic Characterization of the DYLT-1 and DYRB-1 Dynein Light Chains
We obtained putative null alleles to determine if dylt-1 and dyrb-1 function in dynein-dependent processes. DYLT-1 is 40% identical to <span class="yellow">human</span> DYNLT3 and 38% identical to <span class="blue">Drosophila</span> Dlc90F (see alignment in Figure 8A). Two other <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> genes, dylt-2 and dylt-3, encode more divergent members of this protein family. DYRB-1 is 49% identical to both <span class="yellow">human</span> DYNLRB1 and <span class="blue">Drosophila</span> Robl (see alignment in Figure 8A). There do not appear to be other Roadblock genes in the <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> genome [3]. Deletion alleles for both dylt-1 and dyrb-1 have been isolated (Figure 8B). The dylt-1(ok417) deletion removes the entire DYLT-1 open reading frame and does not affect adjacent coding regions. The dyrb-1(tm2645) deletion removes 69% of the dyrb-1 coding region, leaving 29 predicted N-terminal amino acids, and does not affect adjacent coding regions.
Both deletions are currently annotated as homozygous viable [29]. However, we found that the dyrb-1(tm2645) strain was in fact heterozygous for the deletion and that most embryos produced by dyrb-1(tm2645) homozygous animals failed to hatch (Figure 8C). Homozygous dyrb-1(tm2645) <span class="yellow">worms</span> also showed an egg-laying defect and produced small broods (unpublished data). To determine if the dyrb-1 deletion was responsible for the embryonic lethality, we crossed the GFP::dyrb-1 transgene into the deletion background. The presence of the transgene fully rescued the embryonic lethality (Figure 8C), but not the egg-laying defect: the transgene is driven from a germline-specific promoter and so would not be expected to rescue zygotic phenotypes. The embryonic lethality exhibited by dyrb-1(tm2645) mutants is consistent with RNAi studies performed by injection or soaking [12,38]. In contrast, homozygous dylt-1 deletion mutants did not exhibit any larval or embryonic lethality (Figure 8C).
To determine if these dynein light chain mutants exhibit dynein HC-like phenotypes, we observed the completion of meiotic polar body extrusion and the first two mitotic cell divisions in mutant embryos (Figure 8D). The dylt-1 embryos appeared wild type for completion of meiosis, pronuclear migration, and spindle assembly and function. However, the dyrb-1 embryos occasionally contained extra female pronuclei (observed in four of 12 recordings, Figure 8D), suggesting that polar body extrusion was defective, and pronuclear migration was often slow compared to wild-type embryos. Once formed, spindles appeared functional using Nomarski optics, although they were frequently positioned improperly and had large spindle poles, as has also been observed after RNAi knockdown [12]. Thus, these two genes are not strictly essential, but the DYRB-1 protein clearly is required for dynein-dependent processes.<br><br>
Discussion
By using the suppressor screening method outlined in Figure 2B, we have isolated and characterized 49 genes that when reduced in function can suppress a partial loss of dynein HC function. This screening procedure takes advantage of sensitized genetic backgrounds using conditional mutants, can be completed for one mutant in less than 5 wk, and is scalable so that many mutants can be screened in parallel. In fact, we have performed 15 such screens in different sensitized backgrounds (unpublished data). By using three dhc-1ts mutant strains, we found that strain background differences and allele specificity are minimal because most of these genes suppress all three dynein mutants when reduced in function using RNAi. Furthermore, by using two unrelated ts mutants to assay for specificity, we found that 57% of the suppressor genes suppress multiple unrelated mutant loci. Thus, it is clear that assaying the specificity of suppression is critical for evaluating the functional significance of these RNAi interactions. Eliminating the analysis of these nonspecific genes in future screens will save time and resources. Most of the specific suppressor proteins we examined appear to overlap in subcellular localization with the dynein HC, based on previous studies of DHC-1, while one nonspecific suppressor protein, STAR-2, localized to germline P-granules, where dynein is not known to function.
Many of the 20 genes that specifically suppress multiple dhc-1ts alleles are nonessential in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> but well conserved nonetheless. Six of eight deletion alleles available for the 20 specific suppressor genes are homozygous viable, and six additional specific genes do not display lethal phenotypes when reduced in function by RNAi in wild-type <span class="yellow">worms</span> [29]. Thus, our genetic screening has identified roles in an essential process for at least 12 apparently nonessential genes. Fourteen of the specific dynein suppressor genes have <span class="yellow">human</span> orthologs as determined by best reciprocal BLAST hits (Table 1), while mop-25.2 has a conserved <span class="yellow">human</span> homolog but also a paralog in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>. Eleven of these conserved genes are nonessential in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>. Interestingly, eight of the conserved genes in Table 1 have been implicated in <span class="yellow">human</span> disease etiology, with three of them identified as the causative gene [39–41]. Thus, using sensitized genetic backgrounds for genome-wide modifier screens can identify roles for nonessential but conserved genes and thereby provide insights into <span class="yellow">human</span> disease.
Nonspecific Suppression of Conditional Mutants
We examined the predicted molecular functions of the suppressor proteins to better understand the basis for the nonspecific suppression phenomenon. Strikingly, many of the nonspecific suppressor genes encode proteins with predicted roles in mitochondrial, ribosomal, and collagen function (18 of 29 genes, or 62%), while only two such genes appeared to specifically suppress dhc-1 (2 of 20 genes or 10%). It is possible that stress produced by RNAi knockdown of these suppressor genes triggers the activity of molecular chaperones that can generally restore function to ts proteins. Indeed, mutation of dpy-10 is known to suppress three other ts mutants: glp-1, emb-5, and mup-1 [42–44]. Furthermore, RNAi reduction of dpy-10, star-2, osr-1, or C50D2.1 (all suppressors of dhc-1, lit-1, and spn-4 ts alleles) induces the glycerol biosynthetic gene gpdh-2, while dpy-10 and osr-1 mutants exhibit increased glycerol levels, a condition that promotes protein stability [45]. We suggest that partial loss of central metabolic processes can invoke stress responses that nonspecifically alleviate protein-folding problems in ts proteins. Filtering out these nonspecific interactions by testing unrelated conditional mutants increases the likelihood that the remaining suppressor genes are more directly involved with dynein function. However, ts mutants likely differ in their susceptibility to nonspecific suppression mechanisms, and some apparently unrelated ts mutants might share common cofactors such that both mutants are suppressed by depletion of the same cofactor. Nevertheless, we expect that more extensive testing for specificity will prove very useful for judging the significance of modifier interactions.<br><br>Possible Relevance of Suppressor Proteins to Dynein Function
We examined the localization of a number of GFP fusions to suppressor proteins to gain insight into their functional relationship to dynein. In several cases, the subcellular distribution of the suppressor proteins overlapped in different ways with the known and nearly ubiquitous distribution of cytoplasmic dynein in the early <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> embryo. In fact, the only specific suppressor that did not display dynein-like localization was F10E7.8, a homolog of <span class="yellow">yeast</span> Far11 of unknown function [46], which was nuclear. The one nonspecific suppressor protein we examined did not show any dynein-like localization patterns. The subcellular localizations of the GFP::suppressor protein fusions are intriguing. However, given the nearly ubiquitous distribution of dynein in early embryonic cells, biochemical tests for direct association are needed to address the significance of any colocalization detected using light microscopy.
We are particularly interested in suppressor proteins that localize to mitotic spindle poles: the association of the DYLT-1 and DYRB-1 predicted dynein light chains with centrosomes and spindle poles suggests that they may be components of cytoplasmic dynein in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>. Localization of cytoplasmic dynein to centrosomes and spindle poles is well established [47,48], and the inhibition of dynein function prevents centrosome separation, centrosome attachment to nuclei, and the formation of bipolar spindles [6,10,49,50]. Moreover, the centrosomal localization of DHC-1, DYLT-1, and DYRB-1 are all greatly enhanced in dhc-1ts mutant embryos: this dependence of the light chain distribution on the HC further suggests they reside in the same motor complex (Figure 7 and [10]). Furthermore, roadblock light chains are well-established components of dynein, and all of the roadblock protein in mammalian liver extracts is dynein associated [51,52]. Finally, a DYLT-1 homolog in vertebrates is a stoichiometric subunit of cytoplasmic dynein [53]. The presence of these two light chains in a dynein complex is consistent with them having either positive or negative roles in the regulation of HC function (see below).
Cytoplasmic dynein is found on the nuclear envelope where it is thought to regulate nuclear membrane breakdown during mitosis [54], and dynein plays roles during the trafficking of endoplasmic reticulum components [55,56]. Therefore, the nuclear envelope/endoplasmic reticulum proteins NPP-22 and K04F10.3 could couple dynein activity to either of these structures. The anc-1 gene was also isolated in our screening and ANC-1 is localized to the nuclear envelope where it maintains nuclear positioning in postembryonic cells [57]. Reducing the function of these three genes may suppress partial loss of dynein HC mutants by reducing the need for dynein during nuclear envelope breakdown, through constitutive partial destabilization of the nuclear envelope.
The distribution of the cytoplasmic dynein HC includes sites other than spindle poles and nuclear envelopes in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>, for example, at the cell cortex and at the cell division remnant called the midbody [6,10]. The MOP-25.2 protein was found at the midbody and faintly at spindle poles. The MOP-25.2 ortholog in <span class="yellow">S. pombe</span>, Pmo25, is also present at the cell division site and on spindle poles [58]. Mammalian MOP-25.2 homologs stimulate the kinase activity of the LKB1 tumor suppressor (the <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> ortholog is PAR-4), which in turn activates MARK microtubule-destabilizing kinases [59,60]. The <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> MARK ortholog, PAR-1, controls cell polarity during embryogenesis, and orthologs have been implicated in regulation of microtubule dynamics from <span class="yellow">yeast</span> to <span class="yellow">humans</span> [61–64].
Lastly, the two splice isoforms of EFA-6 were associated with the anterior cell cortex in late one-cell embryos. Cortically localized dynein may have important roles in applying forces to astral microtubules that influence mitotic spindle positioning and chromosome separation during anaphase [10,65,66]. EFA6 ARF guanine nucleotide exchange factors require their pleckstrin homology domain for cortical targeting, and are known to regulate cortical actin dynamics in vertebrate cells by promoting guanine nucleotide exchange on ARF6 [67,68]. Our results identifying efa-6 as a dynein HC suppressor suggest a functional linkage of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons at the cell cortex. Interestingly, two <span class="yellow">yeast</span> pleckstrin homology domain proteins, Num1 and mcp5+, localize to the cell cortex and direct astral microtubule and dynein function, although they do not contain a Sec7 domain like EFA-6 does [69–71].<br><br>Function of Dynein Intermediate, Light Intermediate, and Light Chains
The dynein chains in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> exhibit strikingly different functional requirements. The DYRB-1 roadblock light chain is required for completion of meiosis and pronuclear migration, but an at least partially functional mitotic spindle forms in the absence of DYRB-1 (Figure 8). The DLI-1 light intermediate chain is required for multiple dynein-dependent functions: pronuclear migration, centrosome separation, and meiotic and mitotic spindle function [12,34]. DLI-1 may promote nuclear envelope targeting of both centrosomes and DHC-1 by interacting with the nuclear envelope protein ZYG-12 [35]. The second worm light intermediate chain gene, xbx-1, is required for cilia function but not early embryonic development [12,72]. RNAi knockdown of DLC-1, one of three LC8 proteins in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>, produces defects similar to dli-1 but knockdown of the other two LC8-related genes does not result in any phenotypes [12]. RNAi depletion of dyci-1 results in severe meiotic, pronuclear migration, and mitotic spindle assembly defects [12] and in our feeding RNAi regimen dyci-1(RNAi) produces a larval arrest phenotype similar to that observed for dhc-1. Finally, the three Tctex1 proteins in <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span>, DYLT-1, 2, and 3, are not essential for dynein-related functions [12]. As the dyrb-1, dlc-1, and dli-1 dynein AC genes display some dhc-1-like requirements, they positively influence dynein function. However, because reducing their function suppresses dhc-1ts mutants, they may also exert negative regulation (along with dylt-1) on the heavy chain.<br><br>Negative Regulation of Dynein HC by Light Chain Subunits
Finding that reducing the function of light and light intermediate dynein chains suppressed the partial loss of HC function was a striking result. One member of each of four subunit classes can suppress the embryonic lethality associated with three dhc-1 ts mutants (Figure 5). We have considered two different models to explain how RNAi-mediated depletion of these dynein ACs can suppress reduced HC function. First, these dynein subunits could be in functional complexes with, and exert negative regulation on, the DHC-1 HC (Figure 5B). The suppression mechanism in this case proposes that removal of the suppressing ACs increases residual mutant DHC-1 activity. The other, nonsuppressing, accessory subunits might then function in nonmitotic cellular processes such as neuronal transport or organelle positioning. In support of this view, physical removal of the intermediate chains of <span class="yellow">rat</span> cytoplasmic dynein increased HC ATPase activity by about 4-fold (light chains were not monitored in this study but were likely removed as well) [73]. Thus, at least with respect to ATPase activity, some dynein ACs do act as biochemical negative regulators of HC function.<br><br>An Assortment of Essential and Nonessential Dynein Complexes
Alternatively, an assortment of dynein complexes (with different ACs) could coexist within early embryonic cells, with only a subset required for the essential mitotic functions that require DHC-1. In this case, suppression might result from the release of DHC-1 HCs from less essential motor complexes, allowing more of the functionally compromised HCs to participate in the essential process of mitosis. We currently disfavor this hypothesis because two of the suppressing light chains (DYLT-1 and DYRB-1) can indeed localize to meiotic and mitotic spindles (Figures 6 and 7), sites where DHC-1 has been shown by others to localize and function. Furthermore, the distribution of DYRB-1 and DYLT-1 closely resembles the distribution of the HC in dhc-1(or195) embryos, suggesting that these two light chains associate with the HC during mitosis (Figure 7 and [10]). Finally, dhc-1-like phenotypes result from mutation or RNAi knockdown of three suppressing ACs in otherwise wild-type <span class="yellow">worms</span>, indicating that they share at least some common and essential requirements. Regardless of the suppression mechanism, our identification of ACs that genetically interact with the DHC-1 HC provides a basis for functionally classifying the paralogs of these dynein subunit gene families, and for further investigation of dynein composition and function.<br><br>Nonessential Dynein Subunits and Negative Regulation of the HC
Some ACs are nonessential, supporting the view that some cytoplasmic dynein subunits could function by exerting negative regulation on the HC, rather than positively influencing essential HC function. For example, DYRB-1 is not absolutely required for viability because <span class="yellow">worms</span> lacking this protein can be propagated, although they are extremely sick and do exhibit two dhc-1-like phenotypes (Figure 8). Also, homozygous dylt-1 deletion mutants appear fully viable (Figure 8). The two additional Tctex1 <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> genes could be functionally redundant with DYLT-1, but simultaneously reducing the function of DYLT-2 and DYLT-3 by RNAi in the dylt-1 deletion strain did not cause lethality (unpublished data). Because RNAi does not always completely reduce function, the question of redundancy in the Tctex1 <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> gene family remains unresolved. However, <span class="blue">Drosophila</span> contains only a single Tctex1 gene, Dlc90F [74,75]. A Dlc90F null allele that deletes 80% of the open reading frame is essential only for sperm production but not for viability of male or female <span class="yellow">flies</span>, despite the wild-type protein being incorporated into dynein motors and expressed in various <span class="blue">Drosophila</span> tissues [74]. Thus, at least in <span class="blue">Drosophila</span>, the Tctex1 dynein light chain family is not required for cell division processes like the HC is. Interestingly, budding <span class="yellow">yeast</span> does not possess genes for the Tctex1 or roadblock ACs, indicating that functional cytoplasmic dynein does not require these subunits that are conserved in many other organisms. The AC genes that <span class="yellow">yeast</span> does posses are not required for HC motility in vitro because dynein purified from <span class="yellow">yeast</span> with mutations in these genes remains fully active [2]. Thus, dynein function in several contexts does not require AC subunits, and we suggest that in some cases they may have negative regulatory roles. Negative regulation of cytoplasmic dynein may be redundant with other modes of HC regulation or only required during special circumstances. Further studies of subunit localization, and in vitro studies of <span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> dynein motility, may provide further insight into the modes of AC regulation and function.<br><br>
Materials and Methods
<span class="yellow">C. elegans</span> strains and culture.
Strains were cultured according to standard procedures [28]. ts mutants were maintained at 15 °C and GFP-expressing strains in a wild-type background were maintained in a 23 °C incubator. dhc-1(or195) was outcrossed six times to the N2 Bristol wild-type strain and the or283 and or352 dhc-1 mutants were each outcrossed four times with N2. For sequencing mutant dhc-1 loci, genomic DNA was amplified as overlapping ∼1-kb fragments from the start codon to the stop codon and sequenced at the University of Oregon DNA sequencing laboratory. For double mutant constructions, the dhc-1(or195) mutation was monitored by sequencing or by assaying a restriction fragment length polymorphism caused by the mutation with Hpy188I (New England Biolabs, http://www.neb.com), following PCR amplification of the mutated region. The dylt-1(ok417) and ufd-2(tm1380) alleles were monitored by PCR amplification of genomic sequence encompassing the deletions and assaying product size by agarose gel electrophoresis.<br><br>GFP imaging.
Visualization of GFP fusion protein localization was accomplished by mounting embryos on M9 + 3% agarose pads on microscope slides covered with a coverslip. Time-lapse videos were obtained on a spinning disk Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope (Nikon Instruments, http://www.nikon.com) fitted with an ORCA-ER digital camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, http://www.hamamatsu.com) using a Nikon 60×, 1.4 NA Plan Apo oil objective lens. Videos were adjusted for contrast in ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) [76], images were adjusted for levels in Adobe Photoshop (http://www.adobe.com/).<br><br>RNAi screening.
After obtaining the <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> RNAi library from the MRC Geneservice (Cambridge, UK) [17,19], we rearrayed it into a 48-well microplate format using a liquid-handling Qiagen BioRobot 8000 (http://www.qiagen.com). <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> strains were thawed from −80 °C storage and inoculated into 1 ml of LB + 100 mg/ml ampicillin-containing 96-well growth plates (Whatman, http://www.whatman.com) and covered with microporous sealing film (USA Scientific, http://www.usascientific.com). Only 48 wells of the 96-well growth plates were filled with media, corresponding to the rearrayed <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> library. After overnight shaking incubation at 37 °C, 20 μl of the cultures were dispensed with a 24-channel electronic repeating pipette (Rainin, http://www.rainin.com) onto 48-well plates (Nunc, http://www.nuncbrand.com/) containing NGM agar, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 1 mM IPTG and allowed to dry and induce dsRNA at 37 °C overnight. The 48-well agar plates were filled with a Wheaton Unispense peristaltic pump (http://www.wheaton.com) equipped with a custom-made adaptor (University of Oregon Technical Science Administration) that allowed simultaneous filling of eight wells with the agar solution. Approximately 15 hypochlorite-synchronized L1 mutant larvae were pipetted into each well of the 48-well plates with a multichannel pipette and allowed to produce broods. Screening for F1 viability was performed by visual examination with a dissecting microscope. Phenotypes were recorded on an Excel spreadsheet (http://www.microsoft.com) and organized in a FileMaker Pro (http://www.filemaker.com) database. We qualitatively identified 295 initial positive suppressing <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> strains, for which we repeated the assay on 60-mm plates with <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> again thawed from the library (not streak purified). If the observed phenotypes reproduced, the assay was performed with three streak-purified <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> colonies, and a single isolate that again displayed the interaction was kept for further analysis.<br><br>Embryonic viability quantitation methods.
To quantitate embryonic viability we used the following procedure. Cultures of dsRNA-producing bacteria were grown overnight in LB + 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cultures (0.2 ml) were seeded onto 60-mm NGM agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 1 mM IPTG and allowed to induce dsRNAs overnight at room temperature. The L4440 control vector-containing strain was used as the bacterial lawn for the experiments shown in Figures 2A and 3B. Approximately 80 synchronized L1 larvae (obtained from hypochlorite-treated <span class="yellow">worms</span>) were pipetted onto the plates and allowed to grow to young adulthood. Five gravid <span class="yellow">worms</span> were transferred to prepared NGM agar plates supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 1 mM IPTG containing a small RNAi bacterial lawn produced from ∼5 μl of overnight <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> culture. After producing broods, the adult <span class="yellow">worms</span> were removed and the embryos were allowed to develop for at least 24 h. Embryos and larvae were then counted immediately or after storage at 4 °C. We considered only suppressor dsRNAs that increased embryonic viability greater than 3-fold above the background viability observed with the L4440 control vector (in the dhc-1(or195)) screen to be significant enough for continued study.<br><br>Molecular biology.
We introduced a polylinker site containing six unique restriction enzyme recognition sites into the pIC26 GFP-S protein plasmid by using phosphorylated and PAGE-purified synthetic oligonucleotides [77]. Following ligation, the new plasmid was sequence verified. The modified vector, pSO26, allows the use of additional restriction enzymes and directional cloning for inserting genes of interest (Figure S2). The SpeI site was recreated at the 5′ end of the polylinker but not at the 3′ end. We amplified N2 genomic DNA or cDNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) with Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene, http://www.stratagene.com), and cloned A-tailed PCR products into either pGEM-T or pGEM-T-easy shuttle vectors (Promega, http://www.promega.com). Inserted genes were sequence verified at the University of Oregon DNA sequencing laboratory prior to cleavage and ligation to pSO26 (see Table S3 for restriction sites and primer sequences used). All of the constructs used in this study were cloned as SpeI-AsiSI or AscI-AsiSI fragments, except for the STAR-2 gene, which was amplified as a SpeI fragment and cloned into pIC26.
To construct dynein subunit dsRNA-expressing plasmids not available in the RNAi library, gene fragments were amplified from N2 genomic DNA with the following primers: F41G4.1: 5′-AAGATATCACCCAAAATGGTCCAAAACAAAG-3′ and 5′-CGGATATCTCGACTGAAGCTGGTTCTGA-3′, xbx-1: 5′-AAGATATCTACGACGATGGAAGTTTGAAG-3′ and 5′-CGGATATCCGTGCCTCTGCAGC-3′, dlc-3: 5′-AAGATATCAATTTCAGGTGGACACTGGC-3′ and 5′-CGGATATCAGCACACTTGCATCATCTGAA-3′. The PCR products were cut with EcoRV, ligated to EcoRV-digested L4440, and sequence verified.<br><br>Isolation of transgenic <span class="yellow">worms</span>.
GFP fusion plasmids were bombarded into unc-119(ed3) <span class="yellow">worms</span> as previously described except with the following two changes [78]. Three milligrams of gold particles were used per hepta adaptor bombardment. Also, we briefly sonicated the gold particles (prior to DNA coating and while suspended in 50% glycerol) with a Branson sonifier 450 (http://www.sonifier.com/) fitted with a small tip set to power level 1, to disrupt gold aggregates. Non-Unc <span class="yellow">worms</span> were picked to new plates and allowed to produce broods, which were assayed for GFP fluorescence with a Zeiss axioskop microscope (http://www.zeiss.com/) fitted with an X-Cite 120 illumination system (EXFO life sciences, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). For each fluorescent line, 12 GFP-positive <span class="yellow">worms</span> were singled to new plates to determine if the constructs were integrated or were carried as extrachromosomal arrays.<br><br>

Abstract
Attempts to prevent the urea conversion of a 200-230,000 molecular weight DNA polymerase alpha to a 150-170,000 molecular weight form by the inclusion of protease inhibitors have not been successful. No other method has been found capable of dissociating a 50-70,000 fragment or subunit from the DNA polymerase subunit. Addition of this 50-70,000 subunit to the polymerase subunit does not aid the binding of the enzyme to DNA, but does have an effect on the utilisation of synthetic template-initiator complexes by the polymerase subunit.<br><br><br><br>

In order of elution from DEAE cellulose they are enzyme A1 (200-230, 000 molecular weight), A2 (200-230, 000), B (100-110, 000) and C (150-170, 000).

In particular, mild urea treatment can convert both A <br><br> enzymes to C enzyme, with the loss of a subunit or fragment of 50-70, 000 molecular weight.

The mixture was then loaded on to a DEAE cellulose, washed with 0. 03 M potassium phosphate pH 7. 8, and enzyrme eluted either with the standard phosphate gradient or batchwise. Under these conditions usually about 50-60% of recovered activity was <br><br> enzyme C (Fig 1 a). Overall recovery was 70-80%. A enzyme was recon<br><br> 14 <br><br> stituted essentially as described . The flow through material from the <br><br> DEAE cellulose column after the urea treatment was loaded on to a 1 x 0. 8 cm phosphocellulose column, washed with 0.03 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, and the protein eluted with 0.25 M potassium phosphate, pH 7. 8. This material, the putative subunit, was vacuum dialysed with the C enzyme produced by the urea treatment, rechromatographed on DEAE cellulose and enzyme eluted batchwise (Fig 1 b).

The presence of the serine protease inhibitor <br><br> phenylmethylsulphonyl-fluoride in the incubation and chromatography buffers did not affect the conversion of A2to C (Fig 1 a). Likewise trasylol and Na-p Tosyl-L-lysine chloromethylketone HC1 had no effect. However, protease action could have occurred earlier in the purification procedure and the urea could be separating two fragments. Usually the DEAE cellulose profile shows that the majority of the enzyme activity is present as A <br><br> enzyme (Fig 2). In this instance A1 and A2 have not been separated. When the temperature of the material in the original blending procedure was kept below 0?C or phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride, N-a-p Tosyl-L-lysine chloromethylketone HCl or trasylol was included in the isolation buffers the DEAE cellulose profile was similar. The A enzymes were still capable of conversion by mild urea treatment to C enzyme, indicating that if protease activity is involved then it is not susceptible to these inhibitors.

Previous results have indicated that A enzyrrme is stabler to heat and less <br><br> 3348 <br><br> Nucleic Acids Research <br><br> 14, 21 <br><br> susceptible to N-ethylmaleimide than C enzyme  .

Similarly A absorbed and eluted from either native or denatured DNA cellulose remained A enzyme. Both A and C enzymes <br><br> were eluted from the DNA celluloses by less than 0. 1 M NaCl so it does not appear that the subunit enhances the binding of the DNA polymerase subunit to DNA. However, there are differences in the response of A and C <br><br> enzymes to synthetic template-initiator complexes (Table 1). Even if one takes into account the fact that A enzyme is less active on activated DNA <br><br> than C enzyme (the addition of the 50-70, 000 subunit to the polymerase subunit appears to result in a decrease of about 30% of polymerase activity on activated DNA) the A enzyme is still more active on these templates. <br><br> Although there is a variation in activity on these template-initiator comp<br><br> lexes each time assays are carried out on them depending on the method of preparing the complexes and the base ratio of template to initiator, A enzyme always seems to be significantly more active than C.

Abstract
Background
<span class="yellow">Lutzomyia intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">Lutzomyia whitmani</span> (Diptera: Psychodidae) are important and very closely related vector species of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Brazil, which are distinguishable by a few morphological differences. There is evidence of mitochondrial introgression between the two species but it is not clear whether gene flow also occurs in nuclear genes.<br><br>Results
We analyzed the molecular variation within the clock gene period (per) of these two species in five different localities in Eastern Brazil. AMOVA and Fst estimates showed no evidence for geographical differentiation within species. On the other hand, the values were highly significant for both analyses between species. The two species show no fixed differences and a higher number of shared polymorphisms compared to exclusive mutations. In addition, some haplotypes that are "typical" of one species were found in some individuals of the other species suggesting either the persistence of old polymorphisms or the occurrence of introgression. Two tests of gene flow, one based on linkage disequilibrium and a MCMC analysis based on coalescence, suggest that the two species might be exchanging alleles at the per locus.<br><br>Conclusion
Introgression might be occurring between <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> in period, a gene controlling behavioral rhythms in <span class="red">Drosophila</span>. This result raises the question of whether similar phenomena are occurring at other loci controlling important aspects of behavior and vectorial capacity.<br><br><br><br>Background
The Phlebotominae sand <span class="yellow">flies</span> <span class="yellow">Lutzomyia intermedia</span> Lutz & Neiva 1912 and <span class="yellow">Lutzomyia whitmani</span> Antunes & Coutinho 1912 are vectors of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Brazil. These are closely related species that can be only distinguished by a few morphological differences [1] and both show high anthropophily and reported natural infections with Leishmania in different regions of Brazil [2].
Despite their importance as vectors, only a handful of studies have been carried out in these two species using molecular techniques [3-6]. One of the most important findings from an epidemiological perspective is the evidence obtained for introgression between the two species using mitochondrial DNA [4]. This was particularly interesting because apparently, only lineages of <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> sympatric with <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> have been involved in cutaneous leishmaniasis transmission in the peridomestic environment [4], which suggests that genes controlling aspects of vectorial capacity could be passing from one species to the other. In fact, mitochondrial introgression has been reported in other sand <span class="yellow">fly</span> species [7,8] suggesting that might be a common phenomenon in these insect vectors. However, because mitochondrial genes can introgress relatively easily between closely related species [9], it becomes important to examine whether introgression can occur with nuclear genes.
The <span class="red">Drosophila</span> period (per) gene homologue was isolated in sand <span class="yellow">flies</span> by Peixoto et al. [10]. This circadian clock gene was originally identified using mutagenesis by Konopka and Benzer [11], but is also known to control the differences in the "lovesong" rhythms between <span class="yellow">D. melanogaster</span> and <span class="yellow">D. simulans</span> [12], that are important to the sexual isolation between these two species [13-15]. In addition, per was implicated in the control of species-specific circadian mating rhythms in <span class="red">Drosophila</span> and Bractocera, which might also constitute a reproductive isolation mechanism [16-18]. Thus per may possibly represent an example of a <span class="red">Drosophila</span> speciation gene [19], and in fact it has been used as a molecular marker in a number of speciation and evolutionary studies, not only in <span class="red">Drosophila</span> (reviewed in [20]) but also in other insects (e.g. [21]) including sand <span class="yellow">flies</span> [22-24].
Because per controls the circadian clock in different insects [25], it is almost certainly involved in the rhythms of activity and biting of sand <span class="yellow">flies</span> [26], which are very important to leishmaniasis transmission. In addition, per might be involved in reproductive isolation in sand <span class="yellow">flies</span>, via mating rhythms, or via their "lovesongs" [2,27]. per is thus a particularly interesting marker, among the few available, for an introgression analysis in <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span>. Evidence for introgression in per might suggest that gene flow between these two vector species is occurring at other genes controlling important aspects of behavior and vectorial capacity. It might also suggest that per does not have a strong role in their reproductive isolation. In the current study, we analyzed the molecular variation within the per gene of <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> in five different localities in Eastern Brazil.<br><br>Results
Polymorphism and divergence between <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span>
A total of 68 sequences from <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and 53 from <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> homologue to a fragment of the period gene were analyzed from populations of five localities in Eastern Brazil (Fig 1). The alignment of 72 variable sites is shown in Fig 2. Although most of the changes are either synonymous or occur within the 58 bp intron, non-synonymous substitutions are observed causing 9 amino acid differences among the sequences (Fig 2).
Table 1 shows the number of sequences of each population of the two species, the number of polymorphic sites (S) and the estimates of molecular polymorphism θ (based on the total number of mutations) and π. Table 1 also shows the Tajima's [28] and Fu & Li's [29] statistics. Within each species, all populations present similar levels of polymorphism with the exception of <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> from Ilhéus, which seems to be less polymorphic than the others. This population was also the only one presenting a significant value in the Fu & Li test but only at the 5% level. Finally, the last column of Table 1 presents the recombination estimator γ [30] indicating that both species show evidence of intragenic recombination in the per gene.
To investigate the level of intra and interspecific differences, initially an AMOVA was carried out as shown in Table 2. The results show a non-significant within species and a significant between species molecular variation at the per locus. Table 3 shows a more detailed analysis of the intraspecific differentiation among populations of <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span>. None of the pairwise and overall fixation indexes (Fst) are significant in the case of <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and only one (Posse × Ilhéus) has a borderline significant value in <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span>. The results therefore show that no significant geographical heterogeneity was detected among the populations of the two species. The estimated number of migrants per generation, based on the overall Fst values, is 20.683 for <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and 23.125 for <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span>.
Table 4 shows measures for DNA divergence between species (Dxy and Da), as well as the Fst and Nm values considering each species as a unique population. Dxy is the average number of nucleotide substitutions per site between alleles from two different populations and Da is the number of net nucleotide substitutions between two populations. Table 4 also shows the number of polymorphisms exclusive for each species (Sint and Swhit), the number of shared polymorphisms (Ss) and the number of fixed differences (Sf) between species. As one can note, there is a high number of shared polymorphisms between species, and no fixed differences between them suggesting either the persistence of ancestral polymorphisms or the occurrence of introgression. In fact, there is one shared haplotype between the two species (IPO13, WPO10 and WPO19) and three <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> sequences (WAC02, WPO13 and WPO14) which show only one nucleotide difference to "typical" <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> haplotypes (see also below).<br><br>Genealogy of period sequences
A phylogenetic analysis of the period gene sequences from <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> was carried out with the Minimum Evolution method using the Kimura 2-parameter distance (Fig 3). A sequence from <span class="yellow">L. umbratilis</span>, a related species from the same subgenus Nyssomyia, was used as outgroup [24]. The tree shows <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> as non-monophyletic. However, despite the low bootstrap values, which are below 50% in most cases, there is a large group that contains most <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> sequences and a second large group with most <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> sequences. A few other sequences are clustered outside these two main groups. It is interesting to note that there are three <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> alleles (WAC2, WPO13 and WPO14) inside <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> main group, as well as one <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> allele (ICP16) inside the <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> main group. In addition, a second <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> allele (IPO13) is a shared haplotype between the two species as mentioned above. Again, the results suggest either the persistence of ancestral polymorphisms or the occurrence of introgression between the two species. Very similar results were obtained using the maximum likelihood algorithm as implemented in PAUP 4.0b10 software [31] (data not shown).
As mentioned before, there is evidence of intragenic recombination in the per gene fragment of both species (see Table 1) and for that reason the bifurcating tree shown in Fig 3 has to be viewed with caution, as different regions of the gene might have different phylogenetic histories [32]. Therefore, we constructed Minimum Evolution trees with the two most polymorphic non-recombining blocks of the per gene fragment identified using the Hudson and Kaplan [33] method available in the DNAsp 4.1 program [34]. We did not observed major changes in the genealogy of the <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> per sequences, especially regarding the five haplotypes (ICP16, IPO13, WAC2, WPO13 and WPO14) that clearly cluster with sequences of the other species (data not shown).
Finally, a haplotype network was estimated from per sequences using statistical parsimony, as described by Templeton et al. [35] and implemented in the TCS1.21 software [36] (Fig 4). A small number of ambiguities were resolved as suggested by Crandall and Templeton [37]. The haplotype network shows connections between sequences from each species, separating most of the sequences of <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> in two groups. No intraspecific geographical structuring was found. Once again, some of the <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> sequences (WAC2, WAC10, WPO13 and WPO14) appear more closely related to <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> haplotypes. In addition, one <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> allele (ICP16) is connected by a small number of mutations to some of the main <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> haplotypes and IPO13 is a shared haplotype between the two species. These results confirm the same putative introgressed sequences indicated by the phylogenetic reconstructions.<br><br>LD test of introgression
We tested the hypothesis of gene flow between <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> using a method based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) developed by Machado et al. [38]. In this test, x is the difference between the average LD found among all pairs of shared polymorphisms (DSS) between the two species and the average LD among all pairs of sites for which one member is a shared polymorphism and the other is an exclusive polymorphism (DSX). In case of gene flow x should tend to be positive [see [38] for more details].
Because of limitations on the total number of sequences that could be handled by the WH program we could not perform the simulations with all sequences. Therefore, we carried out the LD test of introgression between each pair of sympatric populations of <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> from the localities of Posse, Afonso Claudio and Corte de Pedra. The input files were prepared using the values of recombination and linkage disequilibrium calculated by the SITES program [30] for each population (data not shown). Although no significant values were found for the smaller samples of Afonso Claudio and Corte de Pedra, the results (Table 5) present evidence for introgression in the period gene in both directions (from <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> to <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> and vice-versa) in the locality of Posse.<br><br>Isolation with Migration model
To further examine the gene flow between <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> we used the IM software [39]. The Isolation with Migration model has six demographic parameters that include two migration rates, one for each population. The IM software estimates the posterior probability for each of the model parameters, fitting the Isolation with Migration model to the data. One of the assumptions of this model is that the loci studied do not have internal recombination. Therefore, we identified four different non-recombining blocks of our fragment of per, which were then treated as different loci in the analysis. The four-gametes test [33] implemented in DnaSP4.1 was used for the identification of possible recombination events. Since the program estimates parameters for a pair of closely related populations or species, all sequences of each species were used in the analysis as a single population. We performed MCMC runs using the IM software with different seed numbers, in order to guarantee convergence of the sample.
Maximum likelihood estimates of migration parameters revealed a non-zero value for both species, m1 = 1.398 and m2 = 1.014 (m1 – from <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> towards <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span>; m2 – from <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> towards <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span>). Fig 5 shows the posterior distributions for migration rates and reveals a null probability for the absence of migration from <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> towards <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span>. In addition, the absence of migration in the opposite direction is not included in the 95% confidence interval (values range from 0.222 to 8.898), thus supporting the presence of migration in both directions. The conversion of the migration rate estimate to population migration rate per generation (m1 and m2) is not accurate when the population size is based on a single locus. However, the average of the migrant number per generation for both species was very close to the Nm estimate based on Fst values (Nm ~0.49 in Table 4, m1 ~0.52 and m2 ~0.34).<br><br>
Discussion
There is some evidence that <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> might represent sibling-species complexes in Brazil. <span class="yellow">Lutzomyia neivai</span> Pinto 1926, a sibling of <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> is found in parts of Southern and Western Brazil and some other countries of South America [40]. The present study did not include populations of this species. In the case of <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span>, mitochondrial data [3,6] indicates three main lineages in Brazil: an Amazonian group, a North-South group and a Northeast group. We did not find strong evidence of a geographical differentiation in the period gene among populations of <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> although one of the pairwise Fst comparisons (Posse × Ilhéus) was significant at the 5% level.
When we compare <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span>, we find a highly significant Fst value (0.3373), which is however smaller than that observed for the period gene between sympatric siblings of <span class="yellow">Lutzomyia longipalpis</span> (Fst = 0.3952) [23], a complex of cryptic species that are vectors of American visceral leishmaniasis. Therefore, despite the presence of diagnostic morphological characters to identify <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> [1] the level of molecular divergence in period is not as high as the cryptic <span class="yellow">L. longipalpis</span> siblings.
Even though it is hard to distinguish introgression from the persistence of ancestral polymorphisms, a test of gene flow based on the signature introgression leaves on the patterns of linkage disequilibrium [38] as well as simulations that fit the "Isolation with Migration" model to the data suggest that <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> might be exchanging alleles at the per locus. This is further supported by the presence of shared haplotypes between the two species in Posse and very similar sequences in all sympatric populations. There is mounting evidence that introgression plays a major role in the evolution of closely related insect vector species. Introgression among vectors may have important epidemiological consequences. Gene flow in loci that affect vectorial capacity, such as those controlling host preference and susceptibility to parasite infection, can change the transmission patterns and consequently make the disease control a harder task. Introgression of genes that control adaptation to particular types of environment can also have a major impact on the spread of vector-borne diseases as was proposed for the major African malaria vector <span class="yellow">Anopheles gambiae</span> [41]. The same can be said about genes controlling insecticide resistance. For example, Weill et al. [42] found a kdr mutation responsible for pyrethroid resistance in the Mopti form of <span class="yellow">Anopheles gambiae</span>, a normally susceptible taxon of this species complex. Sequence analysis reveals that this resistant allele probably originates through introgression from the Savanna form.
Although <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> are closely related and only distinguished by a few morphological differences, they do show differentiation in some other important traits. For example, in Posse, one of the localities we studied, the two species show differences in abundance during the year. <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> is more abundant in the summer while <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> is more frequent in the winter months [2]. They also show differences in microhabitat preferences, <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> being more common in the peridomestic area while <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> is found mainly in the surrounding forest [2]. In addition, the two species show marked differences in their tendencies to bite <span class="yellow">humans</span> in the early morning, with <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> showing higher feeding rates than <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> [26]. Therefore, despite the evidence of introgression in the period gene in this locality, there are important ecological and behavioral differences between the two species in Posse suggesting that gene flow is probably rather limited in loci controlling these traits. Hence, it is yet not clear whether introgression has played an important role in the evolution of <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span>. Further work with other genes might help clarify the issue.<br><br>Conclusion
Evidence for introgression between <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> obtained using mitochondrial DNA [4] seems to be corroborated by our data on the period gene, a nuclear marker. Nevertheless, considering that period is potentially involved in reproductive isolation and might be, therefore, less prone to introgression than the "average" gene [43], it is possible that much higher levels of gene flow between the two species occur at other genes. It might, on the other hand, suggest that this behavioral gene, or at least the fragment we analyzed, did not play a role in speciation between <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span>. In fact the same has been suggested for some <span class="red">Drosophila</span> species [44] despite per's role controlling lovesong and mating rhythm differences between <span class="yellow">D. melanogaster</span> and <span class="yellow">D. simulans</span> [13-16].
Although the evidence for introgression in the per gene between <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> is not overwhelming, it does indicate the need to extend this analysis to other loci in the future. We are currently isolating new molecular markers in the two species to carry out a multi-locus approach [39] that might help determining how much variation in gene flow and differentiation there is across the genome of these two very important leishmaniasis vectors.<br><br>Methods
Sand <span class="yellow">fly</span> samples
Sand <span class="yellow">fly</span> samples used in this work were all the F1 generation from wild collected females from the Brazilian localities of Posse (Petrópolis, Rio de Janeiro State, 22°30'S 43°10'W), Jacarepaguá (Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro State, 22°55'S 43°21'W), Afonso Claudio (Espírito Santo State, 20°04'S 41°07'W), Corte de Pedra (Presidente Tancredo Neves, Bahia State, 13°27'S 39°25'W) and Ilhéus (Bahia State, 14°50'S 39°06'W). <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> and <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> were identified according to Young and Duncan [1]. The progeny of each wild caught female was raised separately according to Souza et al. [45] and only one F1 male of each female was used for the molecular analysis, which included 68 individuals of <span class="yellow">L. intermedia</span> (12 from Afonso Claudio, 18 from Posse, 20 from Corte de Pedra and 18 from Jacarepaguá) and 51 individuals of <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> (12 from Afonso Claudio, 17 from Posse, 3 from Corte de Pedra and 19 from Ilhéus). Note that, although the distribution of the two species shows considerable overlap in Eastern Brazil, in many localities only one species is found or is far more abundant than the other. There are also seasonal and microhabitat differences in abundance between them in areas of sympatry [2].<br><br>DNA methods
Genomic DNA was prepared according to Jowett [46] with slight modifications and the PCR was carried out for 30 cycles at 95°C for 30 sec, 60°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 30 sec, using Abgene, Amersham Biosciences or Biotools reagents according to manufacturers directions. The per primer sequences are: 5llper2: 5'-AGCATCCTTTTGTAGCAAAC-3' (forward) and 3llper2: 5'-TCAGATGAACTCTTGCTGTC-3' (reverse). These primers amplify a 486 bp fragment of the sand <span class="yellow">fly</span> per gene homologue that includes part of the PAS/CLD domain, an intron (58 bp) and the beginning of the perS domain [24]. The amplified fragments were cloned using the pMOSBlue blunt ended cloning kit (Amersham Biosciences) and plasmid DNA preparation was carried out using the "Flexiprep" Kit (Amersham Biosciences). Cloned PCR fragments were sequenced at Fundação Oswaldo Cruz and at University of Leicester using ABI 377 sequencers. With the exception of two <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> individuals from Corte de Pedra (see below), only one sequence of each sand <span class="yellow">fly</span> (representing one of the two possible alleles) was used in the analysis but an average of three sequences per individual were obtained in order to check possible PCR induced mutations. In addition, PCR fragments were also sequenced directly in some cases for the same reason. In the case of the two <span class="yellow">L. whitmani</span> mentioned above 6 and 9 clones were sequenced respectively from specimens WCP01 and WCP03 to determine both alleles simply to increase the size of this small sample.
Negative controls were performed for all amplification reactions. In addition, PCR, cloning and sequencing were repeated for two individuals to confirm putative introgressed sequences and to exclude the possibility that they were the result of PCR contamination. Finally, for at least two individuals with putative introgressed sequences, we could define the other allele from additional clones (not included in the analysis), which showed to be typical of the species, indicating no identification problems.
The sequences were submitted to GenBank (accession numbers AY927062 to AY927182).<br><br>Sequence analyses
The preliminary sequence editing was carried out using the Wisconsin Package Version 9.1, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison, and ClustalX [47] was used to perform the multiple alignment. Analyses of population polymorphisms and differentiation between populations were carried out using DNAsp4.1 [34] and ProSeq [48] softwares, while Arlequin v. 2.0 [49] was used for an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) between populations. The Minimum Evolution phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA 3.1 software [50]. The haplotype network was estimated using TCS1.21 [36]. Recombination and linkage disequilibrium analyses were performed using the DNAsp4.1 and SITES program [30]. Linkage disequilibrium simulations were carried out by the WH program [51,52] and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations of the isolation with migration model were performed using the algorithm implemented in the IM program [39].<br><br>

<h3>pmcA2636784</h3>Tissue remodeling: a mating-induced differentiation program for the <span class="blue">Drosophila</span> oviduct
Abstract
Background
In both vertebrates and invertebrates, the oviduct is an epithelial tube surrounded by visceral muscles that serves as a conduit for gamete transport between the ovary and uterus. While <span class="red">Drosophila</span> is a model system for tubular organ development, few studies have addressed the development of the <span class="yellow">fly</span>'s oviduct. Recent studies in <span class="red">Drosophila</span> have identified mating-responsive genes and proteins whose levels in the oviduct are altered by mating. Since many of these molecules (e.g. Muscle LIM protein 84B, Coracle, Neuroglian) have known roles in the differentiation of muscle and epithelia of other organs, mating may trigger similar differentiation events in the oviduct. This led us to hypothesize that mating mediates the last stages of oviduct differentiation in which organ-specific specializations arise.<br><br>Results
Using electron- and confocal-microscopy we identified tissue-wide post-mating changes in the oviduct including differentiation of cellular junctions, remodeling of extracellular matrix, increased myofibril formation, and increased innervation. Analysis of once- and twice-mated females reveals that some mating-responsive proteins respond only to the first mating, while others respond to both matings.<br><br>Conclusion
We uncovered ultrastructural changes in the mated oviduct that are consistent with the roles that mating-responsive proteins play in muscle and epithelial differentiation elsewhere. This suggests that mating triggers the late differentiation of the oviduct. Furthermore, we suggest that mating-responsive proteins that respond only to the first mating are involved in the final maturation of the oviduct while proteins that remain responsive to later matings are also involved in maintenance and ongoing function of the oviduct. Taken together, our results establish the oviduct as an attractive system to address mechanisms that regulate the late stages of differentiation and maintenance of a tubular organ.<br><br><br><br>Background
Most internal organs, including the vascular and respiratory systems and the gastro-intestinal and urinary-genital tracts are comprised of a single epithelial tube or a network of tubes. Tubular organs serve as conduits for the transport of gases, liquids, or solutes, and serve as barriers between biological compartments. To create tubes with specific flow and barrier properties, the morphology of the tube must be precisely specified during development and modulated by physiology. To accommodate specific physiological roles, tissue-specific programs for differentiation are employed at the last stages of development. While much is known about the molecular and cellular basis of tube formation [1-6], little is known about the mechanisms that regulate the late stages of differentiation in which organ-specific specializations arise.
The conservation of genes and similarity in tubular organ design across taxa make <span class="red">Drosophila</span> an excellent model for understanding organogenesis in higher animals. In <span class="red">Drosophila</span>, the best understood tubular organs from a developmental point of view are the trachea and salivary gland. Studies of these organs reveal a general program for tubular organ development, in which combinatorial expression of global patterning genes specifies positions within the embryo for the subsequent activation of tissue-specific early genes and transcription factors. This program results in the activation of downstream genes involved in terminal differentiation of organ-specific specializations such as the cuticle that lines the tracheal lumen [1,2,4,7-9].
The <span class="blue">Drosophila</span> female reproductive tract is another tubular system, consisting of the uterus and a common oviduct (the main tube) that branches into two lateral oviducts. Regional differences in function are observed along the length of the tract, with egg activation occurring largely at the proximal end, in the lateral oviducts, and fertilization occurring at the distal end, in the uterus [10,11]. Unlike other tubular organs, little is known about the development of the female reproductive tract. However, regional differences in function suggest the presence of region-specific differentiation programs within the female reproductive tract.
In <span class="red">Drosophila</span>, mating induces changes in female behavior and physiology via molecules transmitted in the seminal fluid. These changes are rapid and lead to a mated female state which is profoundly different from the unmated female state. While an unmated female lays few eggs and readily accepts the courtship efforts of a male, a mated female exhibits increased egg-laying and actively rejects males [12-19]. Microarray studies of whole <span class="yellow">flies</span> reveal that the changes in egg-laying rate are accompanied by a change in gene expression. Within three hours of mating there is an increase in expression of a small number of genes [20,21]. Rapid changes in gene expression, as well as protein abundance, have also been observed in the female reproductive tract [22,23].
In the upper reproductive tract (lateral and common oviducts, hereafter, oviduct), mating induces an increase in immune related transcripts and down regulates transcription factors involved in cell growth and differentiation. At the protein level mating induces increased abundance of proteins associated with muscle assembly and function and cytoskeletal proteins associated with epithelial morphogenesis [23]. Since many of these mating-responsive proteins act in late differentiation pathways of muscle and epithelia elsewhere (e.g. Bent, Muscle LIM protein 84B(Mlp84B), Neuroglian (Nrg), Coracle (Cora)), we hypothesize that mating triggers similar differentiation in the oviduct. To test our hypothesis we characterized the ultrastructure of oviduct epithelia and muscle, as well as the pattern of innervation before and after mating. We then examined the effect of different mating regimes on oviduct mating-responsive cytoskeletal proteins and on female reproductive output. Our results suggest that active tissue remodeling takes place in the oviduct epithelia and musculature in response to mating. Furthermore, we found a striking increase in innervation of the oviduct after mating.
Our results show that the reproductive tract is an attractive system to address mechanisms that regulate the late stages of tissue differentiation in a tubular organ. Unlike other tubular organs, the last differentiation stage of the oviduct is triggered by an extrinsic cue (mating). This makes it possible to experimentally control the onset of differentiation, with an opportunity to independently examine the effects of mating and age. In addition, it allows us to examine processes essential for reproduction.<br><br>Results
Mating induces changes in oviduct lumen
Our previous molecular profiling showed that mating promotes changes in actin-based cytoskeletal molecules and suggests that mating triggers molecular changes and tissue remodeling in the female reproductive tract that mediate its progression to a mature functional stage [23]. To gain insight into the mechanisms that underlie this progression, we used light and electron microscopy to determine the morphological status of the oviduct in unmated and mated 3-day old females.
In nearly all mated reproductive tracts processed for microscopy (8/9), an egg was located in one of the lateral oviducts, whereas an egg was never observed in the oviduct of unmated reproductive tracts (5/5) (Figure 1). This observation is consistent with previous studies that report increased ovulation and egg-laying at 6 h post-mating [24]. In all unmated reproductive tracts examined, the region between the lateral oviducts and the middle of the common oviduct was either tapered or constricted, whereas this region appeared relaxed in the mated reproductive tract (Figure 1A and 1D). These observations raise the possibility that the lumen is narrow in the unmated oviduct and larger in the mated oviduct. To address this possibility, we collected serial 1 μm longitudinal sections through the reproductive tracts of unmated and mated females and stained these sections with toluidine blue to survey the appearance of the lumen along the entire length of the oviduct (Figure 1B and 1E). Our examination reveals that, in unmated reproductive tracts, the lateral oviduct lumen has an irregular shape, while the common oviduct lumen appears straight. Moreover, in all the unmated reproductive tracts sectioned, we detected patches of darkly stained material in the lumen of the lower common oviduct. In the mated reproductive tract, the lumen of the upper oviduct (defined as the lateral oviduct and upper part of the common oviduct) has an irregular shape, and the lumen of the lower oviduct (defined as the lower part of common oviduct) appears straight. In addition, the lumen of the lower oviduct appears wider in mated than unmated reproductive tracts (Figure 1C and 1F). Interestingly, darkly stained material was not detected in the oviduct lumen of mated females. This observation appears to be consistent with the description made by Mahowald et al. [25], who reported that the oviduct lumen of unmated females is nearly filled with an intima-like matrix and that this matrix is reduced after mating.
Because 3-day-old mated females lay eggs, it is unclear whether the lack of lumenal material and increase in lumen size in mated females occurred before or after the passage of eggs. We suggest that mating directly or indirectly induces morphological changes in the oviduct that facilitate egg passage through the duct. Taken together, our observations lead us to propose that the oviduct lumen is closed and/or obstructed in the unmated reproductive tract, and that mating induces changes in the epithelia and/or muscle that "open" the oviduct lumen.<br><br>Initial formation of cell-cell junctions in oviduct epithelia is mating-independent
To determine whether mating induces specific morphological changes in the oviduct epithelia post-mating, we next examined the ultrastructure of the oviduct epithelia in unmated and mated reproductive tracts. Since molecular profiling demonstrates that proteins associated with cellular junctions such as α- and β-Spectrin (Spec), Cora, and Nrg [23] increase post-mating, we first determined the status of the cellular junctions in the oviduct epithelia of unmated females, and whether these junctions change post-mating. In <span class="red">Drosophila</span>, most ectodermally derived epithelia (such as the epidermis and trachea), with a few exceptions, are joined apically by a belt-like adherens junction called the zonal adherens junction (ZA) followed basally by a septate junction (SJ) [26]. Our analysis reveals that the oviduct is lined, along its entire length, by a monolayered epithelium comprised of squamous-type cells. Although region-specific differences in morphology were observed, all oviduct epithelia examined, in both unmated and mated females, are joined along their lateral membranes by an extensive SJ and lack an apical ZA (Figure 2). SJs and ZAs form complete belts that surround the epithelial cell, thus making these junctions easily visible in transverse sections through the epithelium. Because ZAs were not detected in our transverse sections through the oviduct, this implies that ZAs never formed, or developed earlier and were lost (Figure 2D). Interestingly, we did not detect any ultrastructural differences in the SJs at 6 h post-mating, but we did uncover differences in SJ ultrastructure in different regions of the oviduct.
Based on their ultrastructure, two types of SJs, smooth and pleated, can be distinguished in <span class="red">Drosophila</span> [26]. Smooth SJs are distinguished by the lack of visible septae and the appearance of electron dense material in the intercellular space, while pleated SJs are distinguished by the ladder-like appearance of septae. In the lateral oviducts and upper common oviduct, septa were not detected in the SJ, thus these SJs represent smooth SJs or an immature stage of pleated SJ (Figure 2A, 2A', 2A"). In contrast, a ladder-like arrangement of septae was often visible in the SJs of the lower common oviduct (Figure 2C'), thus these SJs can be classified as pleated. Unlike the smooth-like SJs of the upper oviduct, the pleated SJs of the lower oviduct are followed basally by spot type adherens junction (spot AJs) (Figure 2B, 2B'; additional file 1). Further analysis is necessary to determine if the SJs of the upper and lower oviduct represent different types or different developmental stages. Our findings demonstrate that the initial formation of SJs, as well as spot AJs in the lower oviduct, are mating-independent. This raises an interesting question. Why are SJ proteins such as Cora and Nrg up-regulated post-mating if SJs are formed prior to mating? It is possible that the increased expression of SJ proteins is associated with functional changes in polarized secretion post-mating. Recent studies have shown that SJs play an unexpected role in regulating the apical secretion of specialized extracellular matrix molecules in the trachea [27,28], and that these molecules are important regulators of lumen size.<br><br>Mating modulates apical secretory activity in the oviduct
Given the presence of extensive SJs in the oviduct and the role of SJs in regulating apical secretion of extracellular matrix molecules in other epithelia (e.g. trachea), we asked if mating modulates apical secretion in the oviduct epithelia. Our ultrastructural analysis reveals that different regions of the oviduct display different apical membrane morphology (i.e microvilli or pleats) (see Figures 2 and additional file 2A and 2A), but all epithelia are covered by an electron dense apical extracellular matrix (AECM) and a thin layer of cuticle. We found that mating induces ultrastructural changes in the AECM and cuticle in both the upper and lower oviduct. In the upper oviduct of the unmated female, the AECM varies in thickness along the apical surface (Figure 3A). Some areas have little AECM, while other areas are covered by a distinct layer of AECM (~1–2 μm in thickness; Figure 3B). However, the AECM of mated females is more evenly distributed along the apical surface, (~2 μm in thickness; Figure 3E). Strikingly, the AECM and cuticle of mated females have a ruffled appearance, suggesting that the AECM and cuticle have increased in surface area (Figure 3F). Electron dense granules up to ~1.5 μm in diameter were occasionally observed in both the AECM and cell cytoplasm (Figure 3F). Although further analysis is needed to determine the role of these granules in the oviduct epithelia, it is possible that these granules participate in the secretion and deposition of the AECM. Taken together, our findings suggest that polarized secretion via the AECM, while ongoing in the upper oviduct of the unmated female is enhanced and/or modulated post-mating.
Post-mating changes in AECM ultrastructure are also observed in the lower common oviduct. However, unlike the AECM of the upper oviduct, the AECM of the lower oviduct is well developed prior to mating. In the lower oviduct of the unmated female, the AECM consists of an amorphous electron dense material and is unevenly distributed, forming a thick, bulbous layer above the plasma membrane in some regions (additional file 2). Matrix-like material is also observed in the lumen, but this material is more electron dense than the AECM (additional file 2A and 2A). In the mated female, the AECM is flattened against the plasma membrane and is uniformly distributed along the apical surface (additional file 2B and 2B). Matrix-like material was not observed in the center of the lumen, but small pools of very electron dense material were detected in the spaces between the epithelial folds (additional file 2C and 2C). This may explain why lumenal matrix was not detected at the light microscopic level in the mated female oviduct (see Figure 1E and 1F). Taken together, our observations suggest that the lower common oviduct is a site of active apical secretion in both mated and unmated females, and that matrix secretion, particularly in the lumen, is reduced post-mating. These findings raise the intriguing possibility that the AECM and lumenal matrix function as a plug in the lower oviduct, and that mating induces the breakdown of this plug.<br><br>Mating induces changes in hemi-adherens junctions in upper oviduct
In addition to modulating secretion at the apical membrane, mating induces changes at the basolateral membrane. In many epithelia, one of the last steps of differentiation is the development of a layer of extracellular matrix (ECM) called the basal lamina that covers the apical and/or basal membranes and the concomitant development of hemi-adherens junctions (HAJs). HAJs connect the cell cytoskeleton with the ECM and are formed at virtually all cell surfaces that contact an ECM. HAJs can be distinguished at the ultrastructural level as a patch-like, electron dense undercoat of the plasma membrane that opposes the basal lamina ([26]; Figure 3G, 3H). In the <span class="blue">Drosophila</span> embryo, the HAJs and basal lamina are formed at the same time [26]. Because the basal lamina is established at a time when the majority of extracellular matrix molecules are actively secreted [26,29], this suggests that the formation of HAJs is tightly coordinated with the secretion of the ECM.
One of the most striking post-mating changes observed in the oviduct epithelia was the appearance of numerous HAJs along the basolateral membrane in the upper oviduct (Figure 3). The importance of HAJs, particularly in the upper oviduct, is underscored by the extensive infolding of the basolateral membrane that is observed in both unmated and mated females (Figure 3A and 3E). The infolded membrane gives rise to a highly branched intercellular space that is filled with an ECM (Figure 3C and 3G). This ECM is contiguous with the basal lamina that surrounds the epithelia. Few HAJs were observed in the upper oviduct of the unmated female, and these were largely restricted to the basal membrane, and not observed along the basolateral infolding (Figure 3C). In contrast, numerous HAJs appear along the basolateral infolding post-mating in this region of the oviduct (Figure 3F–3H). In addition, the intercellular space appears wider post-mating (Figure 3C–3D and 3G–3H), suggesting that mating induces increased secretion and/or deposition of the ECM in this cellular compartment and brings the ECM to a threshold concentration that can support the development of HAJs. HAJs were also detected along the basal membrane, but they were not detected along the apical membrane even though this membrane was covered by an ECM. Interestingly, while the basolateral membrane forms very shallow folds in the lower oviduct (see additional file 2), HAJs were observed along this membrane in unmated reproductive tracts (data not shown), thus suggesting that the epithelia is more differentiated in this region of the oviduct, and that the differentiation of the upper and lower oviduct may be under different control.<br><br>Muscle differentiation is enhanced post-mating
While we uncovered post-mating changes in the oviduct epithelia that might facilitate its transition to a high egg-laying state, this transition may also be mediated by changes in oviduct muscle properties and/or activity. The oviduct is lined by circular muscle fibers with supercontractile characteristics [30]. Our previous studies showed that mef2 and mlp84B genes that regulate muscle differentiation, are expressed and increased post-mating in the oviduct, as well as in the sperm storage regions of the reproductive tract [22,23]. This suggests that mating induces muscle differentiation in the reproductive tract. Muscle differentiation is characterized by the assembly of myofilaments into bundles called myofibrils. As muscles differentiate, myofibrils and z-bodies appear simultaneously, and increase in number until the cytoplasm is filled with myofibrils [31]. Like epithelia, one of the last steps of muscle differentiation is the secretion of a basal lamina that surrounds the muscle fiber. To determine if mating induces structural changes in muscles (such as increased myofibrils) we examined the ultrastructure of muscle fibers in the upper and lower parts of the oviduct. Our analysis revealed that, in both unmated and mated reproductive tracts, the muscles of the lower oviduct are highly differentiated as evidenced by the high density of myofibrils, well developed and aligned z-bodies, and secretion of a thick, electron dense basal lamina (Figure 4E and 4F). In contrast, muscle fibers in the lateral oviducts and upper common oviduct appear less differentiated than muscles in the lower common oviduct, as evidenced by the lesser density of myofibrils and z-bodies, and little or no basal lamina (Figure 4A and 4B). Moreover, the muscles of the upper oviduct appear more differentiated in the mated than in unmated reproductive tracts (Figure 4A–4D). Interestingly, we observed neighboring muscle fibers in different states of differentiation in the lateral oviducts in both unmated and mated reproductive tracts, but not elsewhere in the oviduct (Figure 4B). These results suggest that mating enhances the rate of muscle differentiation in the upper oviduct, and that muscle differentiation is delayed in the upper as compared to the lower oviduct. The increased muscle differentiation in the upper oviduct is not dramatic and likely reflects the short post-mating period examined in this study. The delayed differentiation of the upper oviduct muscles resembles the delay in the onset of development between the adult thoracic muscles and abdominal muscles during metamorphosis [32]. Since the ovaries and the other parts of the reproductive tract are known to have different segmental origins [33], we hypothesize that different parts of the oviduct develop at different rates or begin development at different times.<br><br>Increased innervation in the oviduct post-mating
Nerve-muscle interactions play an important role in regulating adult muscle development and refining the final pattern of innervation [34,35]. Given that oviduct muscle differentiation is enhanced post-mating, we predicted that mating either directly or indirectly induces changes in innervation. To address this prediction, we quantified the number of nerve terminals or boutons innervating the lateral oviducts and common oviduct in unmated and mated reproductive tracts. Studies of oviduct innervation in <span class="red">Drosophila</span> reveal that the <span class="yellow">fly</span>'s oviduct receives aminergic, peptidergic and glutamatergic input [30,36-39]. In both larval and adult <span class="red">Drosophila</span>, different types of boutons are formed by neurons that express different neurotransmitters and modulators [40-42]. By similarity to the boutons described at the larval and adult neuromuscular junction, Middleton et al. [30] report that the <span class="yellow">fly</span>'s oviduct is innervated by glutamatergic type I boutons and tyraminergic/octopaminergic type II boutons. Rodgriguez-Valentin et al. [43] further report that the oviduct type II boutons co-express octopamine and glutamate. The neurons that give rise to the type I innervation have not been identified. However, it is well established that type II innervation arises from octopaminergic neurons located in the abdominal ganglion [30,43]. In addition, it has been shown that some or all of these neurons express a GAL4 insertion line for the bullwinkle (bwk) gene [43]. Bwk encodes a HMG-box containing putative transcription factor [44]. To determine if mating induces any changes in the number of type I and II boutons innervating the oviduct muscles, we used the pan-neural marker, anti-HRP to label all oviduct boutons in unmated and mated females. To distinguish between type I and II boutons we used an antibody against the Disc Large (DLG) protein [45]. Type I boutons were identified by their DLG postsynaptic staining and large size (> 8 μm in diameter) (Figure 4G), while type II boutons were distinguished by their absence of DLG staining and smaller size (< 2 μm) (Figure 4H). We find that type I and II boutons innervate the lateral oviducts and common oviduct, and that the type I innervation is restricted to a few axons that run parallel to the length of the oviduct, while the type II innervation is more widespread. We quantified the number of boutons in the lateral oviducts and common oviduct and observed a 74% increase in bouton number in the lateral oviduct and a 66% increase in the common oviduct post-mating (Figure 4I). More over, we observed no significant change in the number of type I boutons in the lateral oviduct and common oviduct. However, we detected a 1.5-fold increase in the number of type II boutons in the lateral oviduct and a 1.8-fold increase in type II innervation in the common oviduct. Dramatic increases in bouton growth are also observed during development. For example, a ten-fold increase in bouton number is observed at the neuromuscular junction during the larval period [46]. To determine if the increase in type II innervation was specific to mating or reflected normal growth in 3 day-old females, we quantified type I and II innervation in the oviducts of 5 day-old unmated females. We found no significant difference in type I and II innervation in unmated 3 day-old and 5-day-old females, indicating that mating, either directly or indirectly, induces a dramatic increase in type II innervation (Figure 4I). To determine if the post-mating increase in innervation is unique to the oviduct, we asked if mating induces a global change in innervation. We quantified bouton number in the adult ventral midline muscles of the 5th abdominal segment. These muscles are innervated by boutons that increase in number during metamorphosis [47]. No significant difference in bouton number was detected at these muscles in unmated and mated females (additional file 3). Though further analysis is needed, this suggests that the post-mating increase in innervation is oviduct-specific. Because the type II boutons are octopaminergic, the increased type II innervation may result in increased octopamine (OA) release in the oviduct. In support of this possibility, we have preliminary evidence that OA is released in the oviduct post-mating (Heifetz and Wolfner, in preparation). Studies in locust and <span class="red">Drosophila</span> demonstrate that OA inhibits oviduct contraction, while glutamate activates oviduct contraction [30,43,48]. In <span class="red">Drosophila</span>, electrical stimulation of the posterior abdominal nerve gives rise to a series of muscle contractions in the oviduct followed by a period of muscle fatigue or relaxation [43]. This pattern of muscle contraction and relaxation may facilitate the proper movement of the egg through the oviduct. In their study of bwk expressing neurons that innervate the oviduct, Rodriguez-Valentin et al. [43] show that OA and glutamate interact to produce the pattern of oviduct contraction and relaxation described above. It is therefore possible that the post-mating increase in type II innervation in the oviduct plays an important role in the increased rate of ovulation and egg-laying observed post-mating.<br><br>Female mating history affects the enrichment of cytosekeletal proteins in the oviduct
To gain insights into the role of cytoskeletal protein enrichment ([23]; additional file 4) in mediating the morphological changes detected in this study, we examined the effect of different mating regimes on cytoskeletal protein abundance. We focused on a subset of mating-responsive cytoskeletal proteins with well established roles in the differentiation of muscle and epithelia. These include: (i) Mlp84B which regulates the late differentiation pathway of muscle [49]; (ii) Cora and Nrg which are required for the formation of septate junctions in epithelia [50], and (iii) Hu-li tai shao (Hts), also known as adducin-like protein, which functions in assembly of the cytoskeletal network. Na+ pump α subunit (ATPα), another protein associated with septate junctions in epithelia, is not a mating-responsive protein and was used as a control. Using western blots, we first determined the abundance of the cytoskeletal proteins in oviducts of 3-day-old unmated and mated females at 6 hrs post-mating. We confirmed the proteomic results of Kalpenikov et al. [23] and found that mating increases the abundance of all proteins, except ATPα in mated oviducts relative to their abundance in unmated oviducts (Figure 5A).
To determine whether the increased abundance of mating-responsive proteins persists for longer times post-mating, we examined oviducts of 10-day-old females that mated once at 3 days of age, and calculated the abundance of the mating-responsive proteins relative to their level in oviducts of 3-day-old unmated females. We found no change or a slight increase in the relative abundance of all cytoskeletal proteins except Mlp84B at 7 days post-mating (Figure 5A). Strikingly, the level of Mlp84B declines by 7 days post-mating to the level observed prior to mating. Thus Mlp84B levels rise and fall after mating, while the epithelial-related proteins rapidly rise and are maintained at a high level after mating. This raises the possibility that a second mating might trigger an increase in Mlp84B protein expression as observed in 3-day-old females at 6 h post-mating. To test this possibility, females were mated twice (once at day 3, and once on day 10 of age), and their oviducts were examined at 6 hrs after the second mating. We calculated the abundance of the cytoskeletal proteins in the twice mated oviducts relative to their abundance in oviducts of 3-day-old unmated females. Our results show that a second mating has little or no effect on Mlp84B abundance. Thus, Mlp84B may represent a class of mating-responsive proteins that is only needed after the first mating. Interestingly, the effect of the second mating on the epithelial-related mating-responsive proteins appears to be different for each protein. While Cora levels drop to the level observed in 3-day-old unmated females, Nrg and Hts are maintained at a high level.
To determine if the changes in cytoskeletal protein abundance are mating-dependent we measured their abundance in the oviducts of unmated 5- and 10-day-old females. We calculated their abundance relative to their level in oviducts of unmated 3-day-old females (Figure 5B). We rationalized that if the change in cytoskeletal protein abundance is mating-dependent we will not see similar changes in unmated females. We observed a slow increase in the relative abundance of all mating-responsive proteins with time post-eclosion (Figure 5B). Because unmated females lay more eggs as they age (see additional file 5C) one possible interpretation of the increased level of cytoskeletal proteins in unmated females is that these proteins are associated with an intrinsic program for oviduct maturation and that mating accelerates this process to maximize egg-laying efficacy. Alternatively, it is possible that the slow increase in protein abundance observed in unmated females is due to the passage of eggs through the oviduct.
Taken together, our results suggest that mating is essential to fine-tune the levels of the mating-responsive proteins examined in this study. Because the changes in cytoskeletal protein abundance are different in unmated and mated females, this suggests that the post-mating changes are mating-dependent. Furthermore, we suggest that these post-mating changes are linked to changes in oviduct function.<br><br>Early or prior mating increases fecundity
In <span class="red">Drosophila</span>, female fecundity decreases with age [51-54]. It has been proposed that this decrease is due, in part, to the loss of germline and somatic stem cells [55]. Since the expression of the oviduct cytoskeletal proteins examined in this study change with age and mating experience, the state of the oviduct may also play a role in fecundity. To separate the effects of age and mating, we measured the fecundity of females that mated twice, first at 3 days post-eclosion and again at 10 days, and compared that to the fecundity of females that mated once at 3 days and females that mated once at 10 days. Fecundity was measured as the number of eggs laid per day per female during the first three days after mating. Once-mated 3-day-old females laid nearly twice as many eggs as once-mated 10-day-old females during the three days examined (24.5 ± 0.7 versus 13.3 ± 0.9, p < 0.0001). Twice-mated 10-day-old females also laid about 50% more eggs than once-mated females of the same age (19.3 ± 0.9 versus 13.3 ± 0.9, p < 0. 0001), but about 20% fewer than laid by once-mated 3-day-old females during the three days examined (19.3 ± 0.9 versus 24.5 ± 0.7, p < 0.0001) (Figure 6A, see also additional file 5A and 5B). Thus, the difference in fecundity between once-mated 10-day-old and once-mated 3-day-old females is not a result of age alone. Rather the main determinant of fecundity at 10 days is whether there had been a prior mating at 3 days. We also calculated the fertility (number of adults eclosed) of once- and twice-mated females. Once-mated 3-day-old females are more fertile than once-mated 10-day-old females (69.5 ± 1.6% versus 56.1 ± 3.0%, p < 0.0001) and slightly more fertile than twice-mated 10-day-old females (69.5 ± 1.6% versus 62.7 ± 2.4%, p < 0.015) (Figure 6B, see also additional file 5D). Because there is no significant difference in fertility between once-mated and twice-mated 10-day-old females, this suggests that (1) a prior mating has no significant effect on the fertility of 10-day-old mated females and (2) fertility decreases with age. One intriguing interpretation of these results is that an early mating increases fecundity which partially compensates for the age-related decrease in fertility. Thus, cytoskeletal mating-responsive protein changes may be associated with structural changes in the oviduct that result in increased fecundity. This may counteract the effects of decreased fertility on the reproductive output.<br><br>
Discussion
Despite the use of <span class="red">Drosophila</span> as a model system for organ-level biology and the emerging parallels between mammalian and <span class="blue">Drosophila</span> reproductive biology [56], this is the first integrative tissue-wide study of post-mating changes in the <span class="blue">Drosophila</span> oviduct. Our results provide several lines of evidence at the molecular, morphological and physiological levels suggesting that mating induces tissue-wide differentiation in the oviduct. Moreover, we identify ultrastructural changes in the mated oviduct that are consistent with the roles that some of the mating-responsive proteins examined in this study (e.g. Mlp84B, Cora, Nrg) are reported to play in muscle and epithelial differentiation elsewhere. For example, the increased abundance of Mlp84B, a major regulator of the late differentiation pathway of muscle [49] is consistent with the increased muscle differentiation in the upper oviduct post-mating (Figure 4A–4F). Similarly, the increased abundance of Cora and Nrg, molecules that are essential for SJ development and function [50] is consistent with the observation that SJs in the upper oviduct are immature and/or that mating induces changes in the apical extracellular matrix whose secretion may be regulated, in part, by SJs as occurs in the trachea [27,28]. Other post-mating changes that indicate that mating induces tissue-wide differentiation include increased HAJs along the basolateral membrane and increased innervation.
Analysis of protein abundance following different mating regimes (unmated, once-mated, twice-mated) gave us further insights into the possible roles that mating-responsive proteins play in the oviduct. For example, Mlp84B is only responsive to the first mating, while the epithelial proteins examined (Cora, Nrg and Hts) are responsive to the first and second mating. Furthermore, the response to the second mating is different from the response to the first mating. Taken together, these results suggest that Mlp84B is required for the final maturation of the oviduct, while the epithelial proteins examined are required for both the maturation and maintenance of the oviduct at a high functional state. Moreover, the post-mating pattern of Mlp84B supports the idea that the first mating induces the final maturation of the oviduct. The rise and fall of Mlp84B abundance after the first mating (Figure 5) parallels the expression pattern of Mlp84B during development where peaks in Mlp84B transcription occur during periods of embryogenesis and metamorphosis when muscle is differentiating [49].
Using different mating regimes we tested whether the first/early mating is essential for maintenance of high reproductive output in the second mating. Our results suggest that mating at an early age is essential to achieve maximum reproductive output (i.e. high fecundity and fertility). Since the first mating increases reproductive output (evidence from our mating regime experiments), it is likely that the ultrastructural changes detected in mated 3-day-old females lead to a highly functional oviduct.
We suggest that the final maturation of the oviduct includes a mating-dependent stage. We propose that during the first few days post-eclosion, the oviduct undergoes the first phase of differentiation, after which the oviduct is developmentally poised for a rapid response to an extrinsic cue (mating). Mating then triggers the second phase of maturation (tissue remodeling and modulation) which is essential for proper oviduct function (Figure 7). We further propose that the second phase of maturation consists of processes that are mating-independent and -dependent, and that both of these pathways are essential to produce a functional oviduct. For example, initial formation of SJs occurs prior to mating (mating-independent) while the increased apical secretion and development of HAJs are mating-dependent. The oviduct musculature is an example where both mating-independent and -dependent processes play a role. Muscles are highly differentiated in the lower oviduct prior to mating, while muscle differentiation is ongoing in the upper oviduct and increases after mating. Although the onset of muscle differentiation in both regions is mating-independent, the further differentiation of muscle in the upper oviduct is mating-dependent. Another possible interpretation of the role of mating on oviduct maturation is that mating accelerates and synchronizes processes that are essential for the functional maturation of the oviduct. It will therefore be interesting to examine the oviducts of older females to determine the status of oviduct maturation.
What is the benefit of mating-induced differentiation of the oviduct tissues? Unmated females are capable of laying eggs, albeit at a reduced rate as compared to mated females of the same age. One possible interpretation is that reproduction is energetically costly, thus delaying oviduct maturation until sperm is available is advantageous to the female. This may reflect the evolution of a mechanism to optimize reproductive capacity in early adulthood in short-lived animals.
In summary, we have identified events at the cellular, molecular and physiological levels that are part of an efficient and specific program for reproduction. <span class="red">Drosophila</span> affords us the opportunity to uncover the signaling pathways that coordinate these events to produce a physiologically functional organ.<br><br>Methods
Flies
Wild-type Canton-S <span class="yellow">flies</span> were used for the fecundity/fertility experiments and confocal analysis. Wild-type Canton-S5 [57] <span class="yellow">flies</span> were used for electron microscopy. All <span class="yellow">flies</span> were kept in a 12 hrs light/dark cycle at 23 ± 2°C. Upon eclosion, females and males were collected on ice and held separately until 3 (females and males) or 10 (females) days of age.<br><br>Sample preparation
For all assays (unless described differently) unmated females were placed with 3-day-old unmated males and observed until mating initiated. At the end of mating, females were aspirated into fresh vials and held for 6 hrs. At 6 hrs after the start of mating, females were placed on ice for dissection. Previous molecular studies indicate changes in protein abundance at 3 hrs post-mating. We hypothesize that these molecular changes will translate into morphological changes in the next few hours. We chose to analyze the morphology of mated females at 6 h post-mating as opposed to later times post-mating because the changes observed at later times may be due, in part, to the high rate of eggs passing through the oviduct.<br><br>Electron microscopy
Reproductive tracts were dissected in Schneider's <span class="blue">Drosophila</span> medium (Sigma) on ice and processed for electron microscopy as described in [42]. Tracts were flat-embedded between two sheets of Aclar (Electron Microscopy Sciences), which allowed us to image the entire tract at the light microscopic level prior to sectioning. Sections were cut on a Reichart Ultracut microtome. One-μm thick sections were stained with 1% toluidine blue, and viewed with a Zeiss Axoplan microscope. Ultrathin sections (~100 nm) were mounted on formvar grids, stained with lead citrate, and viewed with a Philips/FEI Morgagni 268 TEM at 80 kV. Our analysis is based on 4 unmated samples and 3 mated samples. Two unmated samples were cut in the longitudinal plane and two additional unmated samples were cut in the transverse plane, while one mated sample was cut in the longitudinal plane and two additional mated samples were cut in the transverse plane. For longitudinal sections, the entire tract was re-embedded and cut. For samples cut in the transverse plane, the flat-embedded reproductive tract was divided into three regions: (1) lateral oviducts and upper common oviducts, (2) middle common oviduct, and (3) lower common oviduct. Each region was re-embedded and sectioned. It is beyond the scope of this paper to describe all three regions, and our analysis focuses on the uppermost and lowermost regions.<br><br>Immunocytochemistry
Reproductive tracts were dissected in Yamamoto's Ringer (10 mM MOPS; 80 mM NaCl; 10 mM KCL; 0.2 mM MgCl2; 0.1 mM CaCl2) with 5% (w/v) sucrose on ice, fixed in 4% paraphormaldehyde in PBS (phosphate-buffered saline; 0.85% NaCl, 1.4 mM KH2 PO4, 8 mM Na2 HPO4, pH 7.4) for 45 min and then washed in PBS. The reproductive tracts were then incubated in blocking solution (0.5% Triton x-100, 3% NGS, 0.1% BSA) for 2 hrs at room temperature. The following primary antibodies, reagents, and dilutions were used: Cy3-conjugated <span class="yellow">goat</span> anti-HRP, 1:200 (Jackson Immunochemicals, West Grove, PA); <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-Disc Large (DLG), 1:1000 (Developmental Hybridoma Bank), Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin, 1:200 (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes, Scotland). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Flour 488-conjugated <span class="yellow">Goat</span> anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span>, 1:200 and Alexa Flour 546-conjugated <span class="yellow">Goat</span> anti-<span class="yellow">rabbit</span>, 1:200 (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes, Scotland). Reproductive tracts were incubated with the different primary antibodies (diluted in PBS + 0.2% Triton x-100) for 2 hr at room temperature, washed with PBST, incubated with secondary antibodies for 2 hrs at room temperature and washed with PBS. Reproductive tracts of the different treatments were mounted with Antifade media [58] on a multi-well glass slide (Hendley-Essex, UK). For each treatment (unmated, mated) and antibody/reagent (HRP, DLG, phalloidin) a minimum of ten reproductive tracts from at least two independent biological replicates were prepared.<br><br>Confocal microscopy
Reproductive tracts were viewed with a Zeiss 510 laser scanning confocal microscope using 20× and 60× objective with additional zooming. Optical sections from different focal plans of each reproductive tract region (lateral oviducts, common oviduct, uterus) were collected and projected as a reconstructed three-dimensional image using LSM image browser (version 3,5,0,376) software. Image collections were identical for each of the different reproductive tract regions analyzed.<br><br>Quantitation of bouton number
To quantify the number of boutons in the lateral and common oviducts we used ImageJ software (1.37b, National Institutes of Health) to analyze confocal images of anti-HRP and anti-DLG labeled boutons in the oviduct. The number of boutons per unit area was quantified with the Particle Analysis Tool. Briefly, to differentiate between the boutons, the particle analysis tool requires the image to be a "binary" image (i.e., black or white), thus we first converted the images to gray scale. We then set a "threshold" range so that pixels in the image whose value lies in this range are converted to black; pixels with values outside this range are converted to white. We next defined a region of interest (ROI) within the oviduct to count particles (i.e. count boutons). This ROI was saved and served to measure the number of boutons per unit area in each treatment. For each oviduct we counted the number of anti-HRP and anti-DLG labeled boutons in two ROIs within the lateral oviducts and two ROIs in the common oviduct. One-way ANOVA (SPSS 15.0) was used to measure the difference in bouton number per unit area in different regions of the oviducts, in both unmated and mated females.<br><br>Quantitation of cytoskeleton proteins
Sample preparation
To evaluate the effect of mating on the abundance of the cytoskeleton proteins tested, females were: (i) aged for 3 days, mated with 3-day-old unmated males and their oviducts were dissected after 6 hrs post-mating (Once3); (ii) aged for 3 days, mated with 3-day-old unmated males and their oviducts were dissected after 7 days (Once3 day10); (iii) aged for 3 days, mated first with 3-day-old unmated males and held singly for 7 days. At 10 days of age, female were mated again with 3-day-old unmated males. Oviducts were dissected at 6 hrs post-second mating (Twice3&10). We also examined 5-day-old and 10-day-old unmated females (UM5, UM10 respectively).<br><br>SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting
For each mating regime, sixty oviducts were pooled and 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added as described in [59]. Samples were boiled, and then frozen at -20°C until loading. SDS-PAGE was performed on 12% polyacrylamide gels and western blotted as in [60]. Proteins were cross-linked to the filter. The following primary antibodies and dilutions were used: <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-Neuroglian (kindly provided by M. Hortsch) 1:250; <span class="yellow">Guinea pig</span> anti-Coracle (kindly provided by R.G. Fehon) 1:2500; <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-Mlp84B (kindly provided by M.

The developed film was scanned and the signal intensity (protein abundance) of each band was determined using ImageJ software (1.37d, National Institutes of Health). We evaluated protein abundance by measuring the mean gray value of a specific band and the background. The mean gray value of the background was then subtracted from that of the measured band. Relative protein abundance in mated oviduct vs. 3-day-old unmated oviduct was then calculated. Four independent biological replicates were prepared for each mating status. The reported abundance (see Figure 5) is the relative ratio (mated/unmated or unmated/unmated) of at least three replicates that showed the same trend.<br><br>
Examination of female reproductive output
Mating regimes
To evaluate the effect of mating on reproductive output females were treated as follows: (i) aged for 3 days and mated with 3-day-old unmated males (Once3); (ii) aged for 10 days and mated with 3-day-old unmated males (Once10); (iii) aged for 3 days, mated first with 3-day-old unmated males, held for 7 days and mated again with 3-day-old unmated males (Twice3&10). In all cases male and female pairs were observed to record mating initiation and termination.<br><br>Analysis
Following mating, females were aspirated into fresh vials, held singly and allowed to lay eggs for 6 hrs, then transferred daily (each 24 hrs) to fresh vials. The number of eggs laid and the number of eclosed adults were counted from vials created at 6 hrs, 1, 2 and 3 days post-mating. To ascertain the baseline of female egg-laying, we also included in our experiment unmated females that were kept in the same conditions as mated females. The number of eggs laid by unmated females was counted from vials created at 6 hrs, 1, 2 and 3 days after placing the females in the holding vials. In addition, we also recorded the pattern of unmated female egg-laying for 10 days.
To determine the effect of different mating regimes on female reproductive output (i.e. fecundity and fertility), we used One-way ANOVA (SPSS 15.0).<br><br><br><br>Abbreviations

<h3>pmcA150219</h3>Rap1p and other transcriptional regulators can function in defining distinct domains of gene expression
Abstract
Barrier elements that are able to block the propagation of transcriptional silencing in <span class="yellow">yeast</span> are functionally similar to chromatin boundary/insulator elements in metazoans that delimit functional chromosomal domains. We show that the upstream activating sequences of many highly expressed ribosome protein genes and glycolytic genes exhibit barrier activity. Analyses of these barriers indicate that binding sites for transcriptional regulators Rap1p, Abf1p, Reb1p, Adr1p and Gcn4p may participate in barrier function. We also present evidence suggesting that Rap1p is directly involved in barrier activity, and its barrier function correlates with local changes in chromatin structure. We further demonstrate that tethering the transcriptional activation domain of Rap1p to DNA is sufficient to recapitulate barrier activity. Moreover, targeting the activation domain of Adr1p or Gcn4p also establishes a barrier to silencing. These results support the notion that transcriptional regulators could also participate in delimiting functional domains in the genome.<br><br>INTRODUCTION
The eukaryotic genome is organized into discrete functional domains in which gene expression is either permitted or repressed. Domains permissive for gene expression are usually defined as euchromatin or active chromatin, and domains that repress gene expression heterochromatin or silent chromatin. The HML and HMR loci in <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> are silent chromatin domains (1). Compared to active chromatin, silent chromatin is more compact and its histone components are hypoacetylated (2). The SIR complex consisting of Sir2p through Sir4p is an integral part of <span class="yellow">yeast</span> silent chromatin. Sir3p and Sir4p interact with the N-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4 providing the structural basis of silent chromatin (1). Sir2p was recently found to be an NAD-dependent histone deacetylase and was suggested to be responsible for histone hypoacetylation in silent chromatin (3). Silent chromatin is initiated at small cis-acting DNA elements known as the E and I silencers flanking each of the HM loci (4).
Increasing evidence indicates that histone deacetylation is key to the propagation of silent chromatin (4). In vertebrates and <span class="yellow">fission yeast</span><span class="yellow">yeast</span>, spread of silent chromatin involves a chain of events of histone H3 deacetylation → H3 methylation → binding of methylated H3 by HP1 (heterochromatin protein 1) or swi6 (4). In <span class="yellow">S.cerevisiae</span>, there is evidence that Sir3p (hence the SIR complex) has much higher affinity to unacetylated histone H4 than acetylated H4 (5). Based on this and the fact that Sir2p is a histone deacetylase, a refined model for the propagation of silent chromatin can be proposed. In this model, Sir2p recruited to the silencer deacetylates histones in an adjacent nucleosome enabling it to bind another SIR complex with high affinity. The nucleosome-bound SIR complex in turn deacetylates the neighboring nucleosome allowing it to recruit a new SIR complex. In this manner, the SIR complex promotes its own propagation along an array of nucleosomes (4).
The fact that transcriptionally silent chromatin can encroach upon active chromatin poses the question of how interspersed domains of silent and active chromatin are demarcated. Studies of the <span class="red">Drosophila</span> and vertebrate genomes demonstrated that some domains are delimited by boundary or insulator elements (6). These elements are specialized DNA sequences that act as barriers to enhancers and/or silent chromatin. One of the best characterized insulators is the <span class="yellow">chicken</span> HS4 insulator at the β-globin locus. Histones surrounding this insulator are hyperacetylated indicating the presence of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity at the insulator (6). Recently, sequences that could block the spread of silent chromatin have been discovered in <span class="yellow">S.cerevisiae</span> (7,8). These sequences (referred to as silent chromatin barriers) include sub-telomeric anti-silencing regions (STARs), the right boundary of HMR, and the upstream activating sequence (UAS) of the highly expressed TEF2 gene (9–11). The mechanisms underlying barrier functions in <span class="yellow">yeast</span> are not known.
TEF2-UAS contains three tandem repressor activator protein 1 (Rap1p)-binding sites that are necessary and sufficient for its barrier function (11). Rap1p is an abundant sequence-specific DNA-binding protein (12). Variants of the 13 bp consensus sequence for Rap1p binding (ACACC CRYACAYM) (13) lie not only in the UASs of numerous genes but also in the silencers of the HM loci and in telomeric C1–3A repeats. Accordingly, Rap1p functions as a global regulator of transcriptional activation and repression, silencing, as well as telomere length (12). Rap1p performs these diverse functions by interacting with different factors in respective contexts. As an activator, Rap1p binds to the promoters of 362 ORFs (13) and can function via at least three mechanisms. First, Rap1p binding can ‘open up’ local chromatin structure at a promoter to help another activator to bind (14). Secondly, Rap1p bound to DNA can help Gcr1p bind to an adjacent site in the promoter through physical interaction (15). Thirdly, Rap1p is involved in the recruitment of the NuA4 HAT complex and TFIID to ribosome protein genes (RPGs) (16,17). As a silencing factor, Rap1p binds to silencers or telomeric repeats and recruits Sir3p/Sir4p through direct interactions (18). Rap1p also interacts with telomere-specific proteins in executing its role in regulating telomere length (19). It is puzzling that a protein that helps establish silent chromatin could also act as a barrier to its propagation.
In this study, we found that in addition to TEF2-UAS, UASs of many <span class="yellow">yeast</span> genes exhibit barrier activity. Analyses of these UASs indicate that binding sites for transcriptional regulators Abf1p, Reb1p, Adr1p, Gcn4p, as well as Rap1p, may participate in barrier function. These UASs are dispersed across the genome and might play a role in defining functional chromosomal domains. Moreover, we demonstrated that targeting the activation domain of Rap1p, Adr1p or Gcn4p alone, led to barrier function. Since the activation domain of an activator was usually involved in interacting with co-activators and/or components of the transcriptional machinery, these data indicated that other factors might also be involved in barrier function.<br><br>MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plasmids and strains
Plasmids 1–53 were used to make strains 1–53, respectively (see Figs 1–6). Plasmid 1 was previously named pMB22-a that contained a HindIII–BamHI fragment of chromosome III (coordinates 14838–16263) with a URA3 gene inserted at its EcoRV site (20). Plasmid 2 was derived from 1 by inserting TEF2-UAS (–511 to –407 bp relative to the translation start codon) at the SnaBI site. Plasmids 3–38 were identical to 2 except that different fragments from various promoters (see Figs 1 and 2) were inserted at the SnaBI site. Plasmid 29 had a sequence of chromosome III (295327–295713) containing the HMR-tRNA gene (21) inserted at the SnaBI site of plasmid 1. Plasmids 39 and 40 were previously named pYXB26 and pYXB59, respectively (11). Plasmid 41 was identical to pYXB59 except bearing mutations illustrated in Figure 3A. Plasmids 42–48 were previously described as pYXB29, 48, 28, 27, 59, 31 and 37, respectively (11). Plasmid 50 was derived from plasmid 1 by inserting two copies of a sequence bearing the consensus binding sequence of LexA (bold) (22), GGGGTACGTACTGTATGTACATACAGGATATCGGGG, at the SnaBI site. Plasmid 51 was identical to 50 except having only one copy of the LexA-binding sequence. Plasmid 52 was derived from pYXB26 (11) by inserting a SpeI-ADE2-AvrII sequence at the SpeI site. Plasmid 53 was derived from plasmid 52 by inserting TEF2-UAS (–511 to –407 bp relative to the translation start codon) at the SpeI site.
Plasmid L1 (see Fig. 5A) was made by inserting LEU2 into pBTM116 (23) carrying the LexA gene flanked by the promoter and terminator of ADH1. L2 through L8 were derived from L1 by fusing various sequences to LexA (see Fig. 5A and B). Plasmid pRS425 (24) carried the 2 µm origin and LEU2.
Strain YXB76 was MATa ura3-52 leu2-3,112 ade2-1 lys1-1 his5-2 can1-100, E-HMLα-Iinverted (20). Y2047b was MATa HMRa HMLα EΔ79–113::SUP4-o IΔ242 LEU2-GAL10-FLP1 ura3-52 ade2-1 lys1-1 his5-1 can1-100 [cir0] (25). Strain 1 was made by transforming YXB76 to Ura+ with HindIII + BamHI digested plasmid 1. Strains 2–38, 50 and 51 were similarly made with corresponding plasmids, respectively (e.g. strain 2 was made with plasmid 2). Strains 39, 40 and 42–48 were previously described as YXB26, 48, 29, 48, 28, 27, 59, 31 and 37, respectively (11). Strains 41, 52 and 53 (see Figs 3C and 6) were made by transforming Y2047b to canavanine-resistant by BamHI-digested plasmids 41, 52 and 53, respectively. Strains 40′–48′ were sir3::URA3 derivatives of strains 40–48, respectively. The relevant genotypes of all the strains were confirmed by Southern blotting.<br><br>Quantitative mating assay
Quantitative mating was performed as described (11).<br><br>Electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA)
Rap1p was expressed in <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3)</span> from pL3S5, a pET vector carrying the RAP1 gene downstream of a T7 promoter (26). Crude protein extracts were prepared from 40 ml cultures harvested after 3 h of IPTG induction and resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0). A control extract was prepared from a culture without IPTG induction. Western blotting revealed that Rap1p protein was present in the induced extract but not the uninduced one (data not shown). DNA fragments of 26 bp in length (see Fig. 3A) were end-labeled with 32P-phosphate. Fifteen microliter binding reactions were prepared, each consisting of 20 000 c.p.m. radiolabeled DNA probe, 5 µg of crude protein extract, non-specific competitor DNAs (0.3 µg of <span class="yellow">yeast</span> tRNA, 0.3 µg of <span class="yellow">salmon</span> sperm DNA and 0.5 µg of <span class="yellow">E.coli</span> DNA), 10 µg of BSA, 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl2 and 8% glycerol. The reactions were incubated at 25°C for 20 min and loaded onto non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels (4–5%). Gels were run at 40 mA for 1 h in 0.5× TBE buffer.<br><br>Analysis of the supercoiling of DNA circles
Cells were grown in YPR (<span class="yellow">yeast</span> extract + bacto peptone + 2% raffinose) to early log phase. Galactose (2%) was then added to the culture to induce the expression of FLP1. After 2.5 h of incubation, nucleic acid was isolated using the glass bead method and fractionated on agarose gels with 30 µg/ml chloroquine. DNA circles were detected by Southern blotting.<br><br>
RESULTS
UASs of many highly expressed genes can function as barriers to the spread of silencing
We have previously shown that TEF2-UAS was able to block the spread of silencing in a silencer-blocking assay (11). Such an assay tested if a sequence had the ability to prevent a silencer from silencing a reporter gene when it was positioned between the silencer and the reporter. In this report we used a new silencer-blocking assay to identify more barrier elements. This assay employed the URA3 gene and an inverted HML-I that could silence sequences to the right of HML (20) (Fig. 1, strain 1). URA3 expression makes cells sensitive to 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA) thus URA3 silencing could be measured by cell growth on FOA medium (Fig. 1, strain 1). As expected, TEF2-UAS and another known barrier element, HMR-tRNA gene (21) exhibited barrier activity in this assay as indicated by the lack of silencing of URA3 in strains 2 and 29 (Fig. 1).
TEF2 encoding translation elongation factor 1α is one of the most highly expressed genes in <span class="yellow">yeast</span> (27). Other highly expressed genes include ribosome protein genes (RPGs) and genes coding for glycolytic enzymes (27). The coordinated regulation of most of these genes requires the so-called general regulatory factors Rap1p, Abf1p and Reb1p (28,29). Using the above silencer-blocking assay, we tested if the UASs of other highly expressed genes could also block URA3 silencing (Fig. 1). Seventeen new barrier elements were identified from a total of 26 UASs tested. These 17 elements were UASs of eight RPGs (see Fig. 1, strains 3–10), eight glycolytic genes (strains 18–25) and the HIS3 gene (strain 26). All 17 elements except ADH2-UAS and HIS3-UAS exhibited very strong barrier activity as evidenced by the absence of URA3-silencing in strains 3–10 and 18–24 (Fig. 1).
Seven of the eight RPG-UASs that had barrier activity, contained a single or a pair of tandem Rap1p-binding sites (Fig. 1, strains 3–9). Three of them also contained an Abf1p or Reb1p site (strains 6, 8 and 9). One barrier RPG-UAS (strain 10) had only a predicted Abf1p site. Of the seven RPG-UASs that had no barrier activity (Fig. 1, 11–17), only two bore no site for Rap1p, Abf1p or Reb1p (11 and 12). The remaining five each contained one to three Rap1p sites (strains 13–17). RPL15A-UAS (17) also contained an Abf1p site. For most of the 15 RPG-UASs tested (3–17), the presence or absence of predicted Rap1p sites correlated with the presence or absence of Rap1p association in vivo as previously examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (13). Exceptions were the UASs of RPS24B, RPS28A and RPL15A (13).
Of the eight UASs of glycolytic genes tested (Fig. 1, strains 18–25), seven exhibited strong barrier activity (18–24) and one had weaker but detectable barrier activity (strain 25). Glycolytic genes are among the most highly expressed genes and their high expression depends on the functions of Rap1p, Abf1p or Reb1p as well as Gcr1p (29,30). The seven strong glycolytic barriers all consist of one or two Rap1p sites plus one or two Reb1p or Abf1p sites (Fig. 1, strains 18–24). In addition, one or more Gcr1p-binding sites are found adjacent to each Rap1p site. It was proposed that the function of Rap1p was to facilitate the binding of Gcr1p to the UAS (15). Abf1p or Reb1p was shown to play a role similar to that of Rap1p in activating glycolytic genes (31–33).
Although the above data reinforced the notion that certain Rap1p-binding UASs could serve as barriers to silencing, they raised new questions about the essential components of a barrier element. For example, some of the UASs that contained only a single Rap1p site had barrier activity (e.g. RPL19B-UAS, strain 3) whereas others that contained two or three sites had no activity (e.g. RPL39, strain 16). One explanation was that sequences flanking the Rap1p site(s) in a particular UAS could positively or negatively influence barrier function. Moreover, the presence of Abf1p or Reb1p sites in 11 of the 17 new barriers made us wonder if they also participated in barrier function. We began to address these issues by analyzing three new barrier elements (Fig. 2). RPS10A-UAS containing an Abf1p-binding site and a pair of Rap1p sites was divided into three fragments that were tested in a silencer-blocking assay (Fig. 2, strains 30–32). It was clear that only the fragment containing Rap1p sites functioned as a barrier (strain 31). TPI1-UAS bearing a Reb1p site and a Rap1p site was divided into two parts with one containing the Rap1p site (Fig. 2, strain 34) and the other Reb1p site (strain 33). Neither of these fragments alone retained barrier activity indicating that concerted action of Reb1p and Rap1p was required for barrier activity. Duplicating the Reb1p-bearing part of TPI1-UAS didn’t restore barrier activity (strain 35). However, triplicating the Rap1p-containing part did re-create barrier function (strain 36). RPS28A-UAS bore, in addition to a Rap1p site, an Abf1p site and an adjacent T-rich region that are required for efficient transcription of RPS28A (34). A sequence of RPS28A-UAS deleted for a fragment bearing the Rap1p site lost the barrier activity (Fig. 2, strain 37). However, duplicating this sequence restored barrier activity (strain 38). The above results indicated again that Rap1p sites could form barriers (strains 31 and 36). On the other hand, they also suggested that synergistic actions of Abf1p sites (strain 38), Reb1p site + Rap1p site (strain 18), or Abf1p site + Rap1p site (strain 16) could all lead to barrier function. This was not very surprising since Rap1p, Abf1p and Reb1p could perform similar and sometimes interchangeable functions in gene regulation (16,35,36). Note, however, we haven’t ruled out the possibility that other factors (e.g. Gcr1p) or structure features of DNA (e.g. T-tracks) were also involved in barrier function.
It was interesting that ADH2-UAS and HIS3-UAS bearing no site for Rap1p, Abf1p or Reb1p exhibited detectable barrier activity (Fig. 1, strains 25 and 26). However, binding sites for other transcriptional activators existed in these UASs. The major regulator that binds to ADH2-UAS is Adr1p (37). On the other hand, Gcn4p binds to multiple sites in HIS3-UAS and activates HIS3 transcription (38). The possible involvement of Adr1p or Gcn4p in barrier function was examined below. Note Adr1p function was subject to glucose repression (37), which might explain why ADH2-UAS only exhibited limited barrier activity since glucose was used in the media used in our assay.<br><br>Effect of mutating Rap1p-binding sites in TEF2-UAS on barrier function
Although we had shown that the three Rap1p-binding sites in TEF2-UAS were necessary and sufficient for its barrier activity (11), we had not shown if binding of Rap1p to these sites was required. To address this we performed mutational analysis of TEF2-UAS. As shown in Figure 3A and B, the three Rap1p-binding sites in TEF2-UAS (designated as R1, R2 and R3) were all able to bind Rap1p in an EMSA (Fig. 3B). Single or double C→A mutations were introduced into R1, R2 and R3 resulting in m1, m2 and m3, respectively (Fig. 3A). The m2 and m3 sites had both lost the ability to bind Rap1p, whereas m1 still bound Rap1p (Fig. 3B), which could be predicted from the specific mutations in each site (Fig. 3A, compare m1, m2 and m3 to the consensus sequence). We then tested a mutated TEF2-UAS containing m1, m2 and m3 in a silencer-blocking assay using the HML-E silencer and the HMLα genes (Fig. 3C). In this assay, the HML-I silencer was deleted but the HML-E silencer was sufficient to silence the HMLα genes (Fig. 3C, strain 39) (11). Silencing in strain 39 (a-type) was measured by its ability to mate with an α-type strain (Fig. 3C). As predicted, the wild-type TEF2-UAS blocked HMLα silencing (11) (Fig. 3C, strain 40). On the other hand, the mutated TEF2-UAS containing m1, m2 and m3 had lost barrier activity (Fig. 3C, compare the mating efficiencies of strains 41 and 40). Therefore, mutations that prevented Rap1p from binding two of the three sites in TEF2-UAS abolished its barrier activity, indicating that association of Rap1p with TEF2-UAS at more than one site was required for barrier function.<br><br>The barrier TEF2-UAS alters local chromatin structure
In eukaryotic cells, the topology of local DNA reflects the chromatin structure in which it resides. We had previously developed a DNA topology-based assay to examine chromatin structure in vivo, which involved excising a chromosomal region of interest from its genomic location as a circle using site-specific recombination (39). Using this strategy, we demonstrated that DNA in silenced chromatin was more negatively supercoiled than that in active chromatin (39). In this report we used the topology assay to address if barrier elements altered local chromatin structure as <span class="blue">Drosophila</span> or <span class="yellow">chicken</span> insulators did (40,41).
Various sequences (designated X) from UASs of TEF2, AgTEF (TEF gene from <span class="yellow">Ashbya gossypii</span>) and ADE2 were inserted between HML-E and HMLα at HMLΔI (HML locus deleted for the I silencer) flanked by the FRT sites for the Flp1p site-specific recombinase (Fig. 4A and B). The FLP1 gene was under the control of the inducible GAL10 promoter (39). The mating efficiency of each strain measured silencing of HMLα (Fig. 4C). In strains 40, 42, 44 and 47, silencing was restricted to the left of the X insertions and HMLα was derepressed (Fig. 4C). Consistently, the proportion of silent chromatin in the region flanked by the FRT sites in each of these strains was decreased, as indicated by the reduced negative supercoiling of the excised circle (11) (data not shown). Note that the above effect of a barrier on HML chromatin reflected both change in the scope of silencing caused by the barrier activity and alteration (if any) in chromatin structure at the barrier independent of the silencing state of the locus. To exclusively examine the latter, we analyzed the topology of HML DNA in a silencing-deficient background. The SIR3 gene in strains described in Figure 4B was disrupted rendering them defective in silencing (strains 40′–48′ in Fig. 4D). Recombination mediated by Flp1p in these strains led to the excision of a group of chromosomal circles that differed only in the X insertion. The supercoiling of these circles was analyzed as a function of the length of the insertion (Fig. 4D). If an insertion simply lengthened a circle without causing abnormal changes in nucleosomal structure and/or density, the topoisomers of this circle would migrate slower relative to those of a similar circle with a smaller size. Otherwise, migration of the topoisomers would deviate from that predicted based on the size of the circle. As shown in Figure 4D, the circle from strain 40′ bearing a 104 bp barrier element migrated faster rather than slower than the circle from strain 46′ bearing a 91 bp non-barrier element. Circles bearing other barrier elements also exhibited unexpected faster migration (compare strains 44′ to 45′, 47′ to 43′, 42′ to 48′, respectively). Therefore, these data indicated that barrier function correlated with altered topology of local DNA. This was further demonstrated by that mutations in TEF2-UAS that abolished its barrier activity also abolished its effect on DNA topology (Fig. 4D, compare 41′ to 40′; note that circles from both strains had the same size). Since in our gel assay more negatively supercoiled DNA migrate slower, we concluded that every fragment with barrier activity caused a reduction in negative supercoiling of approximately one to two turns in HMLΔI DNA (Fig. 4D, compare the centers of distributions of topoisomers in pairs of lanes, e.g. 40′ and 41′).
The topology of eukaryotic DNA reflects mainly the wrapping of DNA into nucleosomes (approximately one negative superhelical turn is associated with each nucleosome) (42). Therefore, removal of one nucleosome would eliminate approximately one turn. On the other hand, histone acetylation can reduce negative supercoiling associated with a nucleosome by approximately 0.2 turns (43). Therefore, acetylating five nucleosomes would reduce negative supercoiling by approximately one turn. Consequently, the linking number change of one to two brought about by TEF2-UAS can be accounted for by either the loss of one to two nucleosomes or acetylation of five to 10 nucleosomes. Further experiments are under way to clarify the nature of change in chromatin induced by a barrier.<br><br>Targeting the transcription activation domain of Rap1p recapitulates its barrier activity
The multifunctional Rap1p can be divided into at least four functional domains (Fig. 5A) (12). We were interested in defining which of these domains might be involved in the barrier activity of Rap1p. To this end, we fused various parts of Rap1p to the bacterial LexA protein and tested if targeting any of the fusion proteins to LexA-binding sites could re-create a barrier to silencing (Fig. 5A). The LexA-RAP1 fusion genes were carried on 2 µm based plasmids marked by LEU2 (designated L1–L6, Fig. 5A). When introduced into strain 50 in which two LexA-binding sites had been inserted between the inverted HML-I and URA3, LexA alone had no effect on URA3 silencing (Fig. 5A, plasmid L1). Targeting the DNA binding domain, DNA bending domain, silencing domain, or the activating + silencing domain of Rap1p also did not affect URA3 silencing (L2–L5). On the other hand, targeting the activation domain alone recapitulated the barrier activity of Rap1p (L6). These results indicated that the activation domain of Rap1p was involved in barrier activity. The inability of the Rap1p-silencing domain to block URA3 silencing in our assay did not necessarily mean that this domain had no barrier function, since such a function might be suppressed by much stronger silencing activity associated with the silencing domain.
Was the lack of barrier function of fusion constructs L2–L5 due to a lack of expression of these proteins? To address this possibility, we examined the levels of L1–L6 proteins as well as L7 and L8 proteins described in Figure 5B by western blotting using an antibody against LexA. As shown in Figure 5C, L5 was expressed at a level comparable to L6, and L4 was expressed at a higher level than L6. Therefore, the lack of barrier function of L4 and L6 was not the result of their lack of expression. On the other hand, the level of L2 or L3 was significantly lower than that of L6, hence the lack of barrier function of L2 and L3 might be due to their insufficient expression.
As an important control for the above targeting experiments, we showed that plasmids L1–L6 (Fig. 5A) as well as L7 and L8 (Fig. 5B) bearing LexA-fusion genes had no effect on URA3 silencing in strain 1 (Fig. 1) in which there was no binding site for LexA present between HML-I and URA3 (data not shown). Hence, the effect of the fusion proteins on URA3 silencing was the result of their targeting to specific loci, not the consequence of non-specific, indirect functions (if any) of these proteins.<br><br>Targeted activation domain of Adr1p or Gcn4p can also act as a barrier factor
We have shown above that ADH2-UAS bearing Adr1p-binding sites and HIS3-UAS bearing Gcn4p sites both had detectable barrier activity (Fig. 1, strains 25 and 26). Given that tethering the activation domain of Rap1p is sufficient for barrier function, we tested if targeting the activation domain of Adr1p or Gcn4p could also establish a barrier. Adr1p contains four separate activation domains (TADI–TADIV) that can contact Ada2p, Gcn5p and/or TFIIB (45). TAD III (415–467) interacts with only Gcn5p but not Ada2p or TFIIB. We fused this domain of Adr1p and the activation domain of Gcn4p (102–149) to LexA, respectively (Fig. 5B, L7 and L8). Targeting these fusion proteins to two LexA-binding sites between HML-I and URA3 in strain 50 dramatically reduced URA3 silencing (Fig. 5B, compare L7 and L8 to L1). Therefore, like LexA-Rap1p (627–695), both LexA-Adr1p (415–467) and LexA-Gcn4p (102–149) also had barrier activity. Barrier function of these fusion proteins was significantly decreased in strain 51 in which only one LexA site was inserted between HML-I and URA3 (compare strains 50 and 51 carrying plasmid L7), indicating that the potency of such barriers was dependent on the amount of tethered fusion proteins.<br><br>
DISCUSSION
We have shown in this report that UASs of many highly expressed genes could function as barriers to the spread of transcriptional silencing. These newly identified barrier elements together with previously described barrier elements (STARs, HMR-tRNA gene, TEF2-UAS and CHA1-UAS) (9–11,21) are scattered across the <span class="yellow">yeast</span> genome and may play a role in dividing the genome into functional domains. Analyses of the barrier UASs suggest that binding sites for transcriptional regulators Rap1p, Abf1p, Reb1p, Adr1p and Gcn4p can participate in barrier function. Barrier activity often requires concerted actions of more than one factor-binding site. Our mutational analysis of TEF2-UAS suggests a direct involvement of Rap1p in its barrier function. It is noteworthy that not all UASs of highly expressed genes have barrier activity. Many non-barrier UASs also consist of multiple regulator binding sites, therefore other unknown factors might determine whether a UAS could act as a barrier.
How Rap1p and the other transcriptional regulators act to block silencing is not clear. Since they can all act as transcriptional activators, one natural explanation is that they may overcome the silencing effect of a silencer and directly activate the reporter gene. However, it has been well documented that Rap1p and the other transcriptional regulators usually act at relatively short distances (less than ∼600 bp upstream of the translation start codon) (28,29,46), but the binding sites for these regulators were >800 bp from the translation start codon in most of the silencing-blocking tests in this report (Figs 1 and 2). In the test shown in Figure 6, TEF2-UAS blocked ADE2 silencing when it was ∼2 kb downstream from the translation start codon of the gene. Moreover, Fourel et al. (44) demonstrated that the barrier function (or anti-silencing function) of an activator was independent of its role in activating transcription. Therefore, it is unlikely that the ability of a UAS to prevent gene silencing is due to its direct activation of the gene. In light of this, our results are in agreement with the notion that transcriptional regulators can also participate in defining the boundaries of functional chromosomal domains.
A few models have been proposed for the barrier functions of transcriptional regulators. One model proposed that binding of a regulator to a barrier led to the formation of a nucleosome-free region thereby disrupting a continuous nucleosome array (11). Since the SIR complexes spread by self-interaction and interacting with adjacent nucleosmes in a stepwise fashion (4), a nucleosome-free gap could present a barrier to the spreading SIR complex. This ‘nucleosome gap’ hypothesis is consistent with that certain barrier factors such as Rap1p and Reb1p could indeed prevent nucleosome formation around their binding sites (14) and the barrier function of TEF2-UAS correlated with its ability to alter local chromatin structure (this report). In fact, many insulator/boundary elements in higher organisms have also been shown to alter local chromatin structure. For instance, the <span class="yellow">chicken</span> β-globin insulator was linked to changes in nucleosome positioning, and the <span class="blue">Drosophila</span> scs and scs′ boundary elements are associated with unusual chromatin structures that are hypersensitive to nucleases (40,41). However, it is not clear whether any chromatin change associated with barrier function in <span class="yellow">yeast</span> or insulator function in higher cells is the cause or effect of the function.
Another model for barrier action proposed by R. Kamakaka and colleagues (21) proposed that barrier factors recruit chromatin modifying and/or remodeling complexes to counteract the more compact, hypoacetylated silent chromatin. In agreement with this hypothesis, targeted HATs SAS2, GCN5 and ESA1 all had barrier activity (21; Y.-H. Chiu, Q. Yu and X. Bi, unpublished results). Interestingly, Rap1p, Adr1p, Gcn4p and Abf1p share the ability to recruit HAT complexes NuA4 and/or SAGA to target genes (16,45,47–49). Therefore, these factors that are capable of binding to the newly identified barriers may function as barrier factors by recruiting HAT complexes. In fact, recruitment of HAT activity has also been suggested to be the mechanism underlying the function of the <span class="yellow">chicken</span> β-globin insulator (6), although it was not known what HAT might be involved. Our demonstration that tethering the activation domain of Rap1p, Adr1p or Gcn4p alone recapitulates barrier activity is consistent with the above HAT model for barrier function, since at least the activation domain of Adr1p has been shown to directly interact with HAT complexes (45). However, we haven’t ruled out the possibility that the barrier function of the targeted activation domain of Rap1p, Adr1p or Gcn4p is not related to the barrier function of the native protein. Note that the ‘nucleosome gap’ model and the HAT model are not mutually exclusive since the nucleosome gap could result from destabilization of nucelosomes caused by HAT function. A recent intriguing study showed that targeting proteins of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) could also establish a boundary for silent chromatin, and that tethering to NPC was required for boundary activity (50). This led to a revisit to the looping model for the function of boundary/insulator elements (51). However, an alternative explanation was that the NPC compartment could simply be rich in transcriptional activating factors or poor in silencing factors like the SIR proteins (50).
In summary, results from this and other studies indicate that factors previously identified as positive and/or negative regulators of gene activation could also function in demarcating distinct domains of gene activity. How these factors carry out their boundary function is not resolved but recruitment of other factors (e.g. chromatin modifying complexes) is likely to be involved.<br><br>NOTE ADDED IN PROOF
