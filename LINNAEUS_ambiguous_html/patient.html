Abstract
Background
Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disorder of the connective tissue characterized by widespread vascular lesions and fibrosis. Little is known so far on the activation of the hemostatic and fibrinolytic systems in SSc, and most preliminary evidences are discordant.<br><br>Methods
To verify whether SSc <span class="yellow">patients</span> might display a prothrombotic condition, plasma D-dimer was assessed in 28 consecutive SSc <span class="yellow">patients</span> and in 33 control subjects, matched for age, sex and environmental habit.<br><br>Results and discussion
When compared to healthy controls, geometric mean and 95% confidence interval (IC95%) of plasma D-dimer were significantly increased in SSc <span class="yellow">patients</span> (362 ng/mL, IC 95%: 361–363 ng/mL vs 229 ng/mL, IC95%: 228–231 ng/mL, p = 0.005). After stratifying SSc <span class="yellow">patients</span> according to disease subset, no significant differences were observed between those with limited cutaneous pattern and controls, whereas <span class="yellow">patients</span> with diffuse cutaneous pattern displayed substantially increased values. No correlation was found between plasma D-dimer concentration and age, sex, autoantibody pattern, serum creatinine, erythrosedimentation rate, nailfold videocapillaroscopic pattern and pulmonary involvement.<br><br>Conclusion
We demonstrated that SSc <span class="yellow">patients</span> with diffuse subset are characterized by increased plasma D-dimer values, reflecting a potential activation of both the hemostatic and fibrinolytic cascades, which might finally predispose these <span class="yellow">patients</span> to thrombotic complications.<br><br><br><br>Background
Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disorder of the connective tissue characterized by widespread vascular lesions and fibrosis. In SSc, vasospasm causes frequent episodes of reperfusion injury and free radical-mediated endothelial dysfunction, which might finally influence the onset of local thrombotic complications. The characteristic vascular involvement affects primarily small arteries and capillaries, causing reduced blood flow and tissue ischemia and supporting the typical clinical manifestations of this unique autoimmune disorder [1]. However, mechanisms involved in the endothelial injury are as yet elusive and most biochemical evidences are often inconclusive or controversial. Some earlier investigations suggested that SSc <span class="yellow">patients</span> might be characterized by a procoagulant state, reporting depressed basal and stimulated fibrinolytic activity, while others studies have reported normal plasma fibrinolytic activity and normal skin and plasma tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) levels [2-4]. It has been also reported that the lack of a consistent and homogenous increase of some fibrinolytic markers, in the presence of normal levels of antithrombin, might indirectly highlight an impairment of the heparan sulphate-antithrombin system, which would finally promote thrombin generation [3]. Conversely, Cerinic and colleagues provided evidence that fibrinolysis might be impaired in SSc, as shown by reduced D-dimer and decreased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor [4]. In synthesis, there are no conclusive evidences on the activity of the hemostatic and fibrinolytic pathways in SSc so far.
D-dimer, a breakdown product of cross-linked fibrin, was proven useful for the diagnostic evaluation of several thrombotic disorders. Moreover, an increased D-dimer value in plasma is a reliable marker of a systemic prothrombotic state, likely superior to alternative fibrinolytic markers, and its measurement might be helpful in predicting or preventing thrombotic events in the single <span class="blue">patient</span> [5]. Therefore, to investigate whether SSc <span class="yellow">patients</span> might be characterized by a potential prothrombotic condition, plasma D-dimer vales were measured in a subset of SSc <span class="yellow">patients</span>, compared with those of a healthy matched control population and further associated with SSc disease subset.<br><br>Methods
Plasma D-dimer was measured in 28 consecutive SSc <span class="yellow">patients</span> (2 males and 26 females; mean age 50 ± 15 years, 17 with limited and 11 with diffuse disease patterns), who fulfilled the American Rheumatism Association's criteria for the diagnosis of SSc [6] and in 33 control subjects, matched for age (48 ± 13 years), sex (3 males, 30 females) and environmental habit, recruited among healthy hospital personnel. Samples were collected in the morning; all subjects were in a fasted state. The research was carried out according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and an informed consent for testing was received from all individuals recruited to the study. Blood was collected after an overnight fast into siliconized vacuum tubes, containing 0.105 mol/l sodium citrate (Becton-Dickinson, Oxford, UK). Samples were gently mixed and centrifuged for 10 min at 15°C at 1500 × g; plasma was separated and stored in aliquots at -70°C until measurement. Plasma D-dimer was measured employing Vidas DD, a rapid and quantitative automated enzyme linked immunosorbent assay with fluorescent detection, on the Mini Vidas immunoanalyzer (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Analytical imprecision, expressed in terms of mean inter-assay coefficient of variation (CV), was quoted by the manufacturer as being lower than 5%. Significance of differences between samples was assessed, following logarithmic conversion of data, by parametric tests (Student's t-test, ANOVA test, Pearson's correlation); the level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.<br><br>Results and discussion
When compared to healthy controls, geometric mean and 95% confidence interval (IC95%) of plasma D-dimer concentration appeared significantly increased in SSc <span class="yellow">patients</span> (362 ng/mL, IC 95%: 361–363 ng/mL vs 229 ng/mL, IC95%: 228–231 ng/mL, p = 0.005). After stratifying SSc <span class="yellow">patients</span> according to disease subset, no significant differences were observed between those with limited cutaneous pattern (lcSSc) and controls (geometric mean plasma D-dimer: 283 ng/mL, IC95%: 282–285 ng/mL; p = 0.61), whereas <span class="yellow">patients</span> with diffuse cutaneous pattern (dcSSc) displayed substantially increased values (geometric mean plasma D-dimer: 538 ng/mL, IC95%: 536–539 ng/mL; p < 0.001). Additionally, <span class="yellow">patients</span> with active disease, as evaluated according to the European Scleroderma Study Group criteria [7], displayed higher D-dimer levels as compared to <span class="yellow">patients</span> with inactive disease (p = 0.027). As further shown in table 1, D-dimer concentration correlated significantly with the modified Rodnan total skin score (TSS) and the forced vital capacity (FVC). No correlation was observed between plasma D-dimer concentration and age, sex, autoantibody pattern, serum creatinine, erythrosedimentation rate, nailfold videocapillaroscopic pattern and pulmonary involvement, ascertained according to the score proposed by Medsger et al [8].
The pathogenesis of the endothelial injury in SSc is as yet elusive and most biochemical evidences are often inconclusive or controversial. Although endothelial cell apoptosis and impaired angiogenesis have received major attention among the mechanisms involved in the characteristic vascular dysfunction, recent studies provided clear evidence of a significant activation of the coagulation cascade, resulting in a procoagulant state that might finally raise the relative risk of thrombotic events in these <span class="yellow">patients</span>. In SSc, the peculiar vascular lesions and fibrosis were claimed to impair endothelial function, as suggested by impairment of fibrinolysis and activation of the coagulation pathway. The following loss of the balance between fibrinolysis and coagulation might finally contribute to vessel engulfment with fibrin and breakdown of vessel patency, symptomatic of a tendency to the development of thrombotic complications in this particular autoimmune disorder [4]. D-dimer is a heterogeneous class of end-stage degradation products that directly reflect the level of lysed cross-linked fibrin, occurring in vivo with a wide range of molecular weights. Therefore, D-dimer is a well-recognized marker of a systemic prothrombotic state [5,9] and appears a strong, consistent predictor of cardiovascular events in the general population, in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with cardiovascular disease and in other pathologies characterized by an increased risk of thrombosis [10-12]. Accordingly, D-dimer measurement could be reliably used as an initial screening test in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with clinically suspected thrombosis, as its high negative predictive value enables to validly rule out ongoing thrombotic complications [12]. Little is known on the thrombotic tendency of SSc <span class="yellow">patients</span> so far [13]. At variance with previous investigations [2-4], we demonstrated that SSc <span class="yellow">patients</span> with diffuse subset are characterized by increased plasma D-dimer values, reflecting a potential activation of both the coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways.<br><br>Conclusion
Although increased D-dimer values in SSc <span class="yellow">patients</span> were occasionally observed in earlier studies, the association between plasma D-dimer and disease subset is likely an original and innovative issue. The significant correlation observed with disease activity, cutaneous involvement and forced vital capacity, further suggests that SSc <span class="yellow">patients</span>, especially those with diffuse subset, display a hypercoagulable state, which might finally predispose this peculiar subset of <span class="yellow">patients</span> to the development of thrombotic complications.<br><br>Authors' contributions

<h3>pmcA1459157</h3>Piezoelectric osteotomy in hand surgery: first experiences with a new technique
Abstract
Background
In hand and spinal surgery nerve lesions are feared complications with the use of standard oscillating saws. Oral surgeons have started using a newly developed ultrasound bone scalpel when performing precise osteotomies. By using a frequency of 25–29 kHz only mineralized tissue is cut, sparing the soft tissue. This reduces the risk of nerve lesions. As there is a lack of experience with this technique in the field of orthopaedic bone surgery, we performed the first ultrasound osteotomy in hand surgery.<br><br>Method
While performing a correctional osteotomy of the 5th metacarpal bone we used the Piezosurgery® Device from Mectron [Italy] instead of the usual oscillating saw. We will report on our experience with one case, with a follow up time of one year.<br><br>Results
The cut was highly precise and there were no vibrations of the bone. The time needed for the operation was slightly longer than the time needed while using the usual saw. Bone healing was good and at no point were there any neurovascular disturbances.<br><br>Conclusion
The Piezosurgery® Device is useful for small long bone osteotomies. Using the fine tip enables curved cutting and provides an opportunity for new osteotomy techniques. As the device selectively cuts bone we feel that this device has great potential in the field of hand- and spinal surgery.<br><br><br><br>Background
For osteotomies of the hand oscillating saws are usually used [1]. Even though they are varied in size, they are not very precise for use in the vicinity of nerves and arteries. They also pose problems while being used in conjunction with magnification, as one's range of sight and focus is restricted when wearing magnifying glasses. For that reason oral surgeons have moved to using the newly developed piezoelectrical bone scalpel when operating in the near vicinity of nerves or arteries. The tip of this instrument oscillates in the frequency of ultrasound [2]. The mechanism of this device is based on the so called Piezo – Effect. French Physicists Jean and Marie Curie first mentioned the direct Piezo-Effect 1880, whereby certain crystals produce electrical current while under mechanical pressure. The reciprocal effect, by which the crystals are deformed when under electrical current, was then discovered a while later. This is the effect being used by the Piezosurgery Device®. In this device, the electrical field is located in the handle of the saw [3]. Due to the deformation caused by the electrical current, a cutting – hammering movement is produced at the tip of the instrument. These micro movements are in the frequency range of 25 to 29 kHz and, depending on the insert, with an amplitude of 60 to 210 μm. This way only mineralized tissue is selectively cut. Neurovascular tissue and other soft tissue would only be cut by a frequency of above 50 kHz [3-5]. Depending on the strength of the bone and the blade geometry, the efficiency of the cutting can be regulated by the frequency modulator and the power level. For cooling there is an integrated pump with five different working levels. This pump automatically washes physiological solution to the area being cut. The cost of the device is about 7.000 USD. Additional costs per operation are for the cooling liquid and are in the range of a few dollars. We have used the Piezosurgery Device® by Mectron [Italy] [3] for the first time in osteotomies of the long bone in the field of hand surgery. We will report on our experience with one case, with a follow up time of one year.<br><br>Method
The correctional osteotomy was performed on a 23 year old worker who suffered a malunited metacarpal bone fracture of the fifth finger on his dominant hand. The X-ray revealed a 45 degree angular deformity of the fifth metacarpal neck with internal rotation. (Figure 1). The operation was performed under regional anesthesia. A longitudinal incision was made over the fifth metacarpal. The tendon of the extensor digiti minimi was found and on its radial side the periosteum of metacarpal five was reached. The periosteum was opened longitudinally over the defect as usual. For the correction of the defect of 45 degrees, a bone wedge was excised. Instead of using the traditional oscillating saw, the Piezosurgery Device® [3] was used (Figure 2). We used a sharp hardened saw coated with titannitrid (Figure 3). For most of the surgery the highest power level, the boosted burst c, was used. We set the automatic cooling of the area with water to its highest level. The angulation and rotation was corrected and fixed with a 1.5 mm titanium five-hole plate and four screws. Closure of the wound was done in layers. Mobilization was started on the 10th postoperative day. The overall time of observation was one year.<br><br>Results and discussion
The Piezosurgery® Device is ideally sized for hand surgery. The cutting was very precise. The edges of the osteotomy were all sharp to the edge, there was no need to split the bone with a chisel, nor was there the danger of a break out. During the osteotomy there were no disturbing vibrations in the area of operation. This absence of vibration is very practical for operations using a magnifier. Vercellotti mentions that to overcome any problems during surgery, instead of increasing pressure on the hand piece, as in traditional techniques, it is necessary to find the correct pressure to achieve the desired result. With piezoelectric surgery, increasing the working pressure above a certain limit impedes the vibrations of the insert [4]. We have also experienced this in our study. The instrument can be moved in all directions comparable to a pen. The tip of the instrument is exchangeable. Using the fine tip enables multiplanar as well as curved cutting. Because of the automatic water cooling during the whole procedure, there is always a clear view onto the object. This is something oral surgeons found especially useful [6]. The authors mention that the downside of the device is the relative slow sawing process. We needed about 30 seconds for one cut of the relatively small bone. This is about 20 seconds longer than the time needed for cutting with the usual saw. Although the power can be regulated with the power box and the use of different scalpels, we agree with other authors that the optimal use of this device is in surgeries of small bones where precise and soft tissue friendly cutting is required [7]. As other literature has shown, the device selectively cuts bone while sparing nerves and other soft tissue [2,3]. This allows for minimal invasive surgeries with limited retraction of soft tissue and minimal stripping of the periosteum, saves time and might have a positive effect on the healing process. Our aim of the first time use of the Piezosurgery® Device in hand surgery was to check its usability in osteotomies of tubular bones. The preparation of the bone was done in the usual manner as is done when cutting with an oscillating saw. The reason for this was to fully visualize the cutting process using this new device, although in the future, it should be possible to minimize the bony exposure. In our <span class="blue">patient</span> the postoperative healing of the wound and the bone consolidation (Figure 4) were smooth. The duration of postoperative sick leave was four weeks which is more rapid than the usual recovery period. The <span class="blue">patient</span> regained full use of his finger according to the state before the fracture. At no point was there any loss of sensitivity. The <span class="blue">patient</span> as well as the surgeons were fully satisfied with the result.<br><br>Conclusion
The Piezosurgery® Device is a useful device for small long bone osteotomies. We feel that this device has great potential in the field of hand- and spinal surgery. As the device selectively cuts bone, considerable nerve lesions can be avoided and minimal invasive surgeries are possible. Using the fine tip enables curved cutting and provides an opportunity for new osteotomy techniques.<br><br>Competing interests

Abstract
Considerable evidence points to a role for B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) overproduction in <span class="yellow">murine</span> and <span class="yellow">human</span> systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Nevertheless, the correlation between circulating levels of BLyS protein and disease activity in <span class="yellow">human</span> SLE is modest at best. This may be due to an inadequacy of the former to reflect endogenous BLyS overproduction faithfully, in that steady-state protein levels are affected not just by production rates but also by rates of peripheral utilization and excretion. Increased levels of BLyS mRNA may better reflect increased in vivo BLyS production, and therefore they may correlate better with biologic and clinical sequelae of BLyS overexpression than do circulating levels of BLyS protein. Accordingly, we assessed peripheral blood leukocyte levels of BLyS mRNA isoforms (full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS) and plasma BLyS protein levels in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with SLE, and correlated these levels with laboratory and clinical features. BLyS protein, full-length BLyS mRNA, and ΔBLyS mRNA levels were greater in SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> (n = 60) than in rheumatoid arthritis <span class="yellow">patients</span> (n = 60) or normal control individuals (n = 30). Although full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS mRNA levels correlated significantly with BLyS protein levels in the SLE cohort, BLyS mRNA levels were more closely associated with serum immunoglobulin levels and SLE Disease Activity Index scores than were BLyS protein levels. Moreover, changes in SLE Disease Activity Index scores were more closely associated with changes in BLyS mRNA levels than with changes in BLyS protein levels among the 37 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> from whom repeat blood samples were obtained. Thus, full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS mRNA levels are elevated in SLE and are more closely associated with disease activity than are BLyS protein levels. BLyS mRNA levels may be a helpful biomarker in the clinical monitoring of SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>.<br><br>Introduction
B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS; a trademark of <span class="yellow">Human</span> Genome Sciences, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA) is a 285-amino-acid member of the tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily [1-3]. A causal relation between constitutive overproduction of BLyS and development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like illness has incontrovertibly been established in <span class="yellow">mice</span>. BLyS-transgenic <span class="yellow">mice</span> often develop SLE-like features as they age [3-5], and SLE-prone (NZB × NZW)F1 (BWF1) and MRL-lpr/lpr <span class="yellow">mice</span> respond clinically to treatment with BLyS antagonists (decreased disease progression and improved survival) [3,6].
Considerable inferential evidence points to a role for BLyS overproduction in <span class="yellow">human</span> SLE as well. Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated elevated circulating levels of BLyS in 20–30% of <span class="yellow">human</span> SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> tested at a single point in time [7,8]. Moreover, a 12-month longitudinal study documented persistently elevated serum BLyS levels in about 25% of SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> and intermittently elevated serum BLyS levels in an additional 25% of <span class="yellow">patients</span> [9]. Remarkably, circulating BLyS levels did not correlate with disease activity (measured using the SLE Disease Activity Index [SLEDAI]) in these cross-sectional or longitudinal studies [7-9]. Although a statistically significant correlation between circulating BLyS levels and SLEDAI has been appreciated in a more recent 24-month longitudinal study of 245 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> (with >1,700 plasma samples analyzed) [10], the correlation remains weak.
The limited correlation between circulating BLyS protein levels and disease activity in these studies may have exposed an inadequacy of the former to reflect faithfully endogenous BLyS overproduction. In addition to the rate of BLyS protein production, several other factors (for example, utilization and excretion) can affect circulating BLyS protein levels. Although there are no practicable means of directly measuring in vivo BLyS production per se in <span class="yellow">humans</span>, the level of BLyS mRNA may serve as a better surrogate marker of in vivo BLyS production than does the level of BLyS protein. Candidate BLyS mRNA isoforms include the full-length BLyS mRNA isoform, which encodes the full-length protein, and the alternatively spliced ΔBLyS mRNA isoform, which encodes a protein with a small peptide deletion [11]. (ΔBLyS does not bind to cells expressing BLyS receptors, and therefore it has no agonistic activity. Moreover, ΔBLyS can form heterotrimers with full-length BLyS, thereby actually functioning as a dominant-negative antagonist of BLyS activity.)
In this report we demonstrate that peripheral blood leukocytes from SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> express elevated mRNA levels of both full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS relative to those levels expressed by <span class="yellow">patients</span> with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or by normal control individuals. In the SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>, both full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS mRNA levels are more closely associated with disease activity (SLEDAI) than are BLyS protein levels. Accordingly, BLyS mRNA levels may be a helpful biomarker in the clinical monitoring of SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>.<br><br>Materials and methods
General details
This study was approved by the institutional review boards of the University of Southern California and the Scripps Research Institute. All <span class="yellow">participants</span> gave their written informed consent before participation in this study.<br><br><span class="yellow">Participants</span>
<span class="yellow">Patients</span> receiving outpatient medical care at the rheumatology clinics of the Los Angeles County + University of Southern California Medical Center were recruited into the study. Diagnoses of SLE (n = 60) or RA (n = 60) were based on established clinical criteria [12]. Healthy control individuals (n = 30) were recruited from Los Angeles County + University of Southern California Medical Center and University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine personnel. No exclusions were made on any basis other than an inability to give informed consent. Each <span class="blue">patient</span>'s sex, race, age, and medications at the time of the phlebotomy were recorded (Table 1).
Based solely on the <span class="blue">patient</span>'s willingness to donate a second blood sample, repeat blood samples were collected from 37 of the SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> 147–511 days (median 371 days) after collection of the first samples. These <span class="yellow">patients</span> were not selected on the basis of any demographic, clinical, or laboratory feature.
Clinical disease activity for the SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> was assessed using the SLEDAI [13] and using a modified SLEDAI that excludes the contribution of anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies from the total score. Each <span class="blue">patient</span>'s medical chart was reviewed for results of standard clinical laboratory tests within the previous or subsequent 1-month period.<br><br>Plasma BLyS determination
Whole venous blood was centrifuged to yield plasma and a buffy coat. The plasma was harvested, stored at -70°C, and assayed for BLyS levels by ELISA [8,14] using Fab fragments of the capture antibody rather than the whole antibody to reduce assay interference by rheumatoid factor. The lower limit of detection in this assay is 0.3 ng/ml. For statistical purposes, plasma samples with BLyS concentrations below the lower limit of detection were assigned a value of 0.25 ng/ml.<br><br>Blood BLyS mRNA determination
The buffy coat from centrifuged whole blood was harvested, added to RNAlater™ (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) at a 1:4 vol/vol ratio for RNA stabilization, stored at -70°C, and assayed for full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS mRNA levels by real-time PCR. Total RNA was purified from buffy coat samples using RNAeasy miniprep kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), and contaminating genomic DNA was removed by DNAse-I digestion. One-tenth volume of total RNA was used as template in the first-strand cDNA reaction using oligo-dT and the Superscript III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Duplicate samples of cDNA were amplified with primers against β-actin, full-length BLyS, or ΔBLyS: β-actin sense 5'-CGAGAAGATGACCCAGATCATGT-3'; β-actin anti-sense 5'-GGCATACCCCTCGTAGATGG-3'; full-length BLyS sense 5'-GCAGACAGTGAAACACCAACTATAC-3'; ΔBLyS sense 5'-CAGAAGAAACAGGATCTTACACAT-3'; and full-length BLyS/ΔBLyS anti-sense 5'-TGCCAGCTGAATAGCAGGAATTAT-3'.
A 165 bp amplicon for β-actin was PCR-amplified using the 7900 HT ABI Prism machine (Qiagen) with annealing at 65°C. A 296 bp amplicon for full-length BLyS was PCR-amplified, with annealing at 64°C. A 270 bp amplicon for ΔBLyS was PCR-amplified with annealing at 61°C. The annealing conditions for full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS were determined so that each primer set remained specific to the respective BLyS isoform and yielded a PCR efficiency similar to those of cloned cDNA standards. Melting curve analysis revealed a single peak for each gene amplified. The threshold cycle (Ct) values for each reaction were determined using Sequence Detection System software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Results are presented as ratios of full-length BLyS or ΔBLyS mRNA to β-actin mRNA, which were calculated using the following formulae:
2 exp(Ctβ-actin - Ctfull-length BLyS)
2 exp(Ctβ-actin - CtΔBLyS)<br><br>Determination of anti-BLyS autoantibodies
BLyS was bound to microtiter plates by first coating the plates with streptavidin and then adding biotinylated recombinant BLyS. Using these plates as the capture reagent, plasma samples were incubated, and <span class="yellow">horseradish</span> peroxidase-conjugated anti-<span class="yellow">human</span> IgA/IgM/IgG (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL, USA; 1:20,000 final dilution) or <span class="yellow">horseradish</span> peroxidase-conjugated anti-<span class="yellow">human</span> IgG (Southern Biotechnology; 1:10,000 final dilution) were used as the detector reagents.<br><br>Statistical analysis
All analyses were performed using SigmaStat software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Results that did not follow a normal distribution were log-transformed to achieve normality. Parametric testing between two matched or unmatched groups was performed using the paired or unpaired t test, respectively. Parametric testing among three or more groups was performed using one-way analysis of variance. When log-transformation failed to generate normally distributed data or the equal variance test was not satisfied, nonparametric testing was performed using the Mann–Whitney rank sum test between two groups and by Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance on ranks among three or more groups. Correlations were determined using Pearson product moment correlation for interval data and using Spearman rank order correlation for ordinal data or for interval data that did not follow a normal distribution. Nominal data were analyzed using χ2 analysis-of-contingency tables.<br><br>
Results
Elevated plasma BLyS levels and blood levels of full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS mRNA isoforms in systemic lupus erythematosus <span class="yellow">patients</span>
Previous reports of elevated circulating BLyS levels in SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> were based on a BLyS ELISA that utilized a whole (unfragmented) capture anti-BLyS monoclonal antibody [7-9]. Since the publication of these reports, it has been recognized that the presence of rheumatoid factor can potentially interfere with the assay and lead to spurious overestimation of the true circulating BLyS levels (<span class="yellow">Human</span> Genome Sciences, Inc.; unpublished observations). To mitigate potential interference from rheumatoid factor, the BLyS ELISA has been modified and the capture anti-BLyS monoclonal antibody is now utilized as a Fab fragment. Despite the changes in the ELISA format, our findings are entirely consistent with those of the previous reports. Plasma BLyS levels were significantly greater in the SLE group than in either RA or normal control group (P < 0.001; Figure 1a). Arbitrary assignment of the 95th percentile value among the normal control individuals as the upper limit of 'normal' revealed that two of the 30 normal control individuals, 15 of the 60 RA <span class="yellow">patients</span>, and 29 of the 60 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> harbored elevated plasma BLyS levels (P < 0.001).
Overexpression of BLyS in SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> was also established by measuring BLyS mRNA levels normalized to β-actin mRNA levels in peripheral blood leukocytes (buffy coats). The geometric mean full-length BLyS mRNA and ΔBLyS mRNA levels among the SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> were each significantly greater than those among the RA <span class="yellow">patients</span> and normal control individuals, respectively (P < 0.001 for each; Figure 1b,c). Arbitrary assignment of the 95th percentile values for full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS mRNA levels among the normal control individuals as the upper limits of 'normal' revealed that two of the 30 normal control individuals, four of the 60 RA <span class="yellow">patients</span>, and 20 of the 60 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> had elevated full-length BLyS mRNA levels (P < 0.001), and that two of the 30 normal control individuals, three of the 60 RA <span class="yellow">patients</span>, and 19 of the 60 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> had elevated ΔBLyS mRNA levels (P < 0.001). Levels of full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS mRNA strongly correlated with each other (r = 0.703; P < 0.001) in the SLE cohort, and plasma BLyS levels also correlated significantly with levels of each BLyS isoform (r = 0.429, P < 0.001; and r = 0.290, P = 0.024, respectively). Among these SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>, none of the measured BLyS parameters correlated with <span class="blue">patient</span> age, sex, race, or daily dose of corticosteroids (data not shown). Because the racial composition of the normal cohort was not as predominantly Hispanic as were those of the RA and SLE cohorts, we assessed the BLyS parameters in the respective Hispanic subpopulations. As for the entire populations, values for SLE were significantly greater than those for either RA or normal controls (P ≤ 0.004; data not shown).<br><br>Correlations between BLyS parameters and plasma immunoglobulin levels
BLyS is a potent B cell survival factor [15-21], and administration of exogenous BLyS to <span class="yellow">mice</span> leads to B cell expansion and hypergammaglobulinemia [1]. Previous studies with numbers of SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> greater than were included in the present study documented a modest but significant correlation between serum levels of BLyS and IgG [8,10]. In our SLE cohort of limited size, plasma BLyS levels failed to show significant correlations with plasma levels of total immunoglobulin, IgG, or IgA. In contrast, full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS mRNA levels correlated significantly with each (Figure 2). (None of the BLyS parameters correlated with plasma IgM levels.) The absence of significant correlation between plasma BLyS levels and the immunoglobulin parameters also persisted when just the 53 <span class="yellow">patients</span> with detectable plasma BLyS levels were considered (r = -0.133, P = 0.346 for total immunoglobulin; r = -0.048, P = 0.734 for IgG; and r = 0.033, P = 0.817 for IgA).<br><br>Correlations between BLyS parameters and disease activity
Previous studies either have failed to demonstrate a significant correlation between disease activity and circulating BLyS levels [7-9] or have detected only a weak correlation between the two [10]. Consonant with those studies, we identified no significant correlation between plasma BLyS levels and SLEDAI in our cohort of 60 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> (Figure 3a). The failure to demonstrate a significant correlation cannot be attributed to a skewing of the results by the <span class="yellow">patients</span> in whom plasma BLyS levels were below the limit of detection, because no significant correlation was detected among the 53 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> in whom plasma BLyS levels were in the detectable range (r = 0.185, P = 0.183). In contrast, a significant correlation between SLEDAI and full-length BLyS mRNA levels was readily discernible (Figure 3b). A trend toward a correlation between SLEDAI and ΔBLyS mRNA levels was also observed, although it did not achieve statistical significance (Figure 3c).
A component of the SLEDAI is the presence of circulating anti-dsDNA antibodies. Because circulating BLyS levels may affect the presence and/or titers of circulating anti-dsDNA antibodies [7-10], we assessed correlations between the individual BLyS parameters and a modified SLEDAI that excludes any consideration of anti-dsDNA antibodies. As with the unmodified SLEDAI, the modified SLEDAI did not correlate with plasma BLyS levels (Figure 3d) either among the SLE cohort overall or among the 53 <span class="yellow">patients</span> in whom plasma BLyS levels were in the detectable range (r = 0.160, P = 0.252), but it significantly correlated with full-length BLyS mRNA levels (Figure 3e) and exhibited a trend toward correlation with ΔBLyS mRNA levels (Figure 3f). Thus, the stronger correlations between BLyS mRNA levels and disease activity cannot solely be explained by any effects that BLyS may have on anti-dsDNA antibodies per se.
Moreover, among the 37 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> who were evaluated on two separate occasions, trends toward correlation were appreciated between changes in the unmodified or modified SLEDAI and changes in full-length BLyS or ΔBLyS mRNA levels but not changes in plasma BLyS levels (Figure 4). These results cannot be ascribed to changes in medications taken by the <span class="yellow">patients</span>, because changes in neither disease activity nor in any of the BLyS parameters correlated with changes in the doses of corticosteroids or cytotoxics taken by the <span class="yellow">patients</span> (data not shown). The failure to demonstrate a meaningful association between changes in SLEDAI score and changes in plasma BLyS protein levels cannot be attributed to a skewing of the results by the <span class="yellow">patients</span> in whom plasma BLyS levels were below the limit of detection, because the absence of association between the two persisted among the 27 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> in whom plasma BLyS levels were in the detectable range in both samples (r = -0.069, P = 0.727 for plasma BLyS versus unmodified SLEDAI; r = -0.020, P = 0.919 for plasma BLyS versus modified SLEDAI).<br><br>Lack of correlation between levels of BLyS mRNA isoforms and percentages of individual leukocyte cell types
Among cells in peripheral blood, BLyS is predominantly expressed by cells of the myeloid lineage (monocytes and neutrophils) [1,14,22,23]. Accordingly, a shift in the differential leukocyte count away from lymphocytes to monocytes and/or neutrophils could substantially alter BLyS mRNA results. Because of the limited amount of blood we were permitted to obtain from the SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> (consequent to the high prevalence of anemia among these <span class="yellow">patients</span>), we were unable to purify the individual leukocyte populations for BLyS mRNA analysis. Nevertheless, to demonstrate that the elevated BLyS mRNA levels in SLE did not simply reflect a shift in differential leukocyte count, we assessed the correlations between the individual BLyS parameters on the one hand and the percentages of blood neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes on the other. No correlations were appreciated (Figure 5).<br><br>Presence of anti-BLyS autoantibodies in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with systemic lupus erythematosus
The poorer correlation between plasma BLyS protein levels and disease activity compared with that between BLyS mRNA levels and disease activity was striking. <span class="yellow">Patients</span> with SLE frequently develop autoantibodies against self-antigens, and so some of the SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> might have harbored autoantibodies to BLyS. Such autoantibodies could have complexed with BLyS and enhanced its clearance, thereby masking BLyS overproduction. Alternatively, such autoantibodies might have sterically blocked the epitopes recognized by the detecting antibodies in the in vitro ELISA. In this case, measured BLyS levels would have been spuriously reduced, again masking BLyS overproduction.
In our cohort, IgA/IgM/IgG anti-BLyS antibodies were detected in six out of the 60 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>. Such autoantibodies were also detected in two out of 60 RA <span class="yellow">patients</span> and in one out of 30 normal control individuals, demonstrating that anti-BLyS autoantibodies are not restricted to SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>. IgG anti-BLyS autoantibodies were detected in 3 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> but in no RA <span class="yellow">patients</span> or normal control individuals.<br><br>
Discussion
Elevated blood levels of BLyS protein and mRNA are well described features of <span class="yellow">human</span> SLE [7-9]. We confirmed these observations in our study and extended them by documenting increases not just in levels of full-length BLyS mRNA but also in levels of ΔBLyS mRNA (Figure 1). Of note, BLyS mRNA levels were elevated in SLE but not in RA, raising the possibility that BLyS overproduction in SLE is systemic whereas BLyS overproduction in RA may be more focused to the affected arthritic joints [24]. The modestly elevated plasma BLyS protein levels in RA <span class="yellow">patients</span> may reflect, at least in part, release of locally overproduced BLyS into the circulation.
The relationship between circulating BLyS protein levels and disease activity was addressed in several previous studies, but significant correlations between the two measures did not emerge [7-9]. In the largest study to date, a 2-year longitudinal study of 245 <span class="yellow">patients</span> in which more than 1,700 plasma samples were analyzed, a significant but weak correlation between the two was appreciated [10]. In the present study, a significant correlation between plasma BLyS protein levels and disease activity was again not realized (Figure 3a,d).
The weak, at best, correlation between circulating BLyS levels and disease activity is seemingly rather surprising. There is a clear-cut association in BlyS transgenic <span class="yellow">mice</span> between BLyS overexpression and development of SLE-like features [3-5], and treatment of SLE-prone <span class="yellow">mice</span> with BLyS antagonists retards the progression of disease and improves survival [3,6]. Moreover, development of precocious glomerular pathology in autoimmune-prone <span class="yellow">mice</span> correlates strongly with circulating BLyS levels [25].
The likely explanation for the weak correlation between circulating BLyS levels and disease activity in <span class="yellow">human</span> SLE is not that disease activity in SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> is insensitive to the degree of BLyS overproduction. Rather, a more tenable explanation is that circulating BLyS levels in <span class="yellow">human</span> SLE do not always accurately reflect excessive endogenous BLyS production. We can identify at least three nonmutually exclusive mechanisms to explain a dissociation between the two.
First, SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> frequently develop autoantibodies to a myriad of self-targets (for example, erythrocytes, lymphocytes). Indeed, we detected circulating IgA/IgM/IgG anti-BLyS autoantibodies in 10% (6/60) of the tested SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>, and we detected circulating IgG anti-BLyS autoantibodies in 5% (3/60). These percentages may be underestimates of the true prevalence of anti-BLyS autoantibodies, because some of these autoantibodies may be saturated in vivo with circulating BLyS, rendering them incapable of binding to BLyS in the in vitro detection assay. We do not yet know whether the anti-BLyS autoantibodies are functionally neutralizing but, regardless, such autoantibodies could enhance the clearance of BLyS and/or interfere with in vitro detection of BLyS, thereby masking endogenous BLyS overproduction.
Second, increased urinary excretion of BLyS has been reported in SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>, especially among those with clinically overt renal involvement [26]. At least four of the <span class="yellow">patients</span> we studied manifested nephrotic-range proteinuria (≥3 g/24 hours), and so urinary loss of BLyS was probably substantial in at least these <span class="yellow">patients</span>. A validated assay for urinary BLyS detection has not yet been developed so we were unable to quantify urinary BLyS levels. Once an assay for urinary BLyS levels is validated, we should be able to assess the effect of urinary BLyS excretion on circulating BLyS levels.
Third, BLyS promotes in vivo expansion of B cells [1]. Freshly isolated SLE B cells, despite intact surface expression of BLyS receptors, bind less biotinylated BLyS ex vivo than do freshly isolated normal B cells [27]. Although other interpretations are possible, the most likely explanation is that BLyS receptors on B cells in SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> are occupied in vivo by soluble BLyS. Accordingly, it is likely that BLyS receptors expressed by the expanded B cell population do bind BLyS and remove it from the circulation, resulting in a homeostatic pathway that modulates the effects of BLyS overproduction on circulating BLyS levels. Indeed, circulating levels of BLyS rise with peripheral blood B cell depletion and fall with re-emergence of peripheral blood B cells in rituximab-treated RA or SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> [28,29], highlighting this inverse relationship between circulating BLyS levels and B cell load. Moreover, one of the hallmarks of active disease in <span class="yellow">human</span> SLE is the increased percentages of activated B cells and plasma cells in peripheral blood [30-34], probably reflecting increased systemic numbers of activated B cells and plasma cells. Although not yet formally tested, differential BLyS receptor expression by these cells compared with expression by nonactivated B cells may result in increased peripheral BLyS utilization, further dampening the effects of BLyS overproduction on circulating protein levels.
To circumvent these confounding processes, we used BLyS mRNA levels as a surrogate marker of endogenous BLyS production. Overall, the correlations between disease activity and either full-length BLyS or ΔBLyS mRNA levels were much stronger than that between disease activity and BLyS protein levels (Figures 3 and 4). This was the case regardless of whether we used the standard SLEDAI or the modified SLEDAI as a measure of disease activity. These correlations were not spurious ones consequent to shifts in percentages of leukocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood, because BLyS mRNA levels did not correlate with percentages of blood neutrophils, monocytes, or lymphocytes (Figure 5).
A similar pattern was observed between plasma immunoglobulin levels and the BLyS parameters, with plasma levels of total immunoglobulin, IgG, and IgA correlating significantly with full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS mRNA levels but not with plasma BLyS levels (Figure 2). These significant correlations between full-length BLyS or ΔBLyS mRNA levels and plasma immunoglobulin levels again highlight the greater ability of BLyS mRNA levels, compared with plasma BLyS protein levels, to reflect ongoing BLyS overproduction.
At present, it is not known whether soluble ΔBLyS protein is present in the circulation of SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> or of normal individuals. Although full-length BLyS protein is readily cleaved and released from cells transfected with a vector containing <span class="yellow">murine</span> full-length BLyS, ΔBLyS protein is not cleaved or released from <span class="yellow">murine</span> ΔBLyS transfectants [11]. Given the strong similarities between <span class="yellow">murine</span> and <span class="yellow">human</span> full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS, it is likely that <span class="yellow">human</span> soluble ΔBLyS protein is also not cleaved from the cell surface and released into the circulation. Moreover, soluble ΔBLyS protein is not released from cells transfected with a vector containing just the extracellular domain of <span class="yellow">human</span> ΔBLyS (which encodes the soluble protein; A.L. Gavin, unpublished observations). Whether this reflects rapid intracellular degradation of soluble ΔBLyS or some other impediment to its release remains unknown. Regardless, if the inability to release soluble ΔBLyS in vitro faithfully recapitulates in vivo biology, then the stronger associations between SLE disease activity and full-length BLyS or ΔBLyS mRNA levels compared with that between SLE disease activity and BLyS protein levels could not be attributable to interference by biologically inactive (inhibitory) ΔBLyS protein in the BLyS protein detection ELISA. Importantly, even if soluble ΔBLyS protein is present in the circulation and is detected by the BLyS protein detection ELISA, then the stronger correlations between SLE disease activity and full-length BLyS or ΔBLyS mRNA levels than that between disease activity and total BLyS (including ΔBLyS) protein levels suggest that full-length BLyS and/or ΔBLyS mRNA levels may operationally serve as useful biomarkers of disease activity in SLE. Although the complexity and labor intensiveness associated with quantitative real-time PCR may render measurement of BLyS mRNA levels impracticable for routine clinical practice, such measurement could readily be incorporated into clinical trials and yield valuable information.
Longitudinal observations in large numbers of SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> will be necessary to establish or refute the utility of full-length BLyS and/or ΔBLyS mRNA to subserve this clinically vital function.
Although expression of the two major BLyS isoforms was highly coordinate among SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>, there were several <span class="yellow">patients</span> in whom ΔBLyS mRNA levels were markedly greater than or less than the expected values based on full-length BLyS mRNA levels (data not shown). This raises the possibility that dysregulation of ΔBLyS may contribute to overall BLyS dysregulation in at least some SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>. It is known that interferon-γ, interleukin-10, interferon-α, and CD154 can upregulate full-length BLyS mRNA levels [14,22,35], but it is not known what effects these or other cytokines/cell-surface structures have on ΔBLyS expression. Further investigation of the regulation of ΔBLyS and the differential expression of BLyS isoforms is certainly warranted.
Although the associations between full-length BLyS and/or ΔBLyS mRNA levels and disease activity in SLE were usually strong when the SLE cohort was analyzed in aggregate, there were several SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> in whom BLyS mRNA levels were quite high despite little objective ongoing disease activity, and there were several SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> in whom BLyS mRNA levels were low despite considerable ongoing disease activity. One must recognize that the bulk of the pathogenic autoimmune responses probably takes place in the spleen and lymph nodes, rather than in the peripheral blood, where myeloid lineage cells (for example, dendritic cells) produce BLyS and support B cell survival and expansion [36]. Local BLyS production in the secondary lymphoid tissues will be more important to the development and maintenance of an autoimmune response than will remote BLyS levels in the circulation. Because at least some autoreactive B cells may be more sensitive to BLyS-mediated survival signals than non-autoreactive B cells [37,38], local increases in BLyS production could preferentially promote expansion of autoreactive B cells. These cells, in turn, could activate autoreactive T cells by presenting autoantigen to them, and some of the autoreactive B cells would respond to T cell derived signals and mature into (pathogenic) autoantibody secreting plasma cells. In contrast to <span class="yellow">murine</span> studies, in which investigators can readily harvest and analyze lymphoid and myeloid lineage cells from any site (for example, spleen, bone marrow), such is not the case for <span class="yellow">human</span> studies. Peripheral blood is the only site readily accessible for <span class="yellow">human</span> studies, and it is possible that, at least in some <span class="yellow">patients</span>, BLyS mRNA levels in circulating leukocytes do not reflect local BLyS production in the secondary lymphoid tissues.
One must also recognize that disease activity in SLE is not solely driven by B cells. Systemic inflammation and SLE flares can be triggered via B cell independent means. Not all SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> treated with a B cell depleting course of rituximab experience clinical remission [39], strongly pointing to the importance of non-B cells in disease pathogenesis/maintenance. Conversely, not all pathogenic B cells necessarily require high levels of BLyS to effect their pathogenicity. <span class="yellow">Murine</span> studies have unequivocally documented B cell subpopulations that do not depend upon BLyS for their survival [40-42]. Although <span class="yellow">mice</span> completely devoid of BLyS have reduced numbers of mature B cells and harbor reduced levels of immunoglobulin, these reductions are incomplete. Thus, it is possible that some SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> harbor pathogenic B cells that are relatively insensitive to BLyS and could drive considerable disease activity even in the context of low endogenous BLyS production. Conversely, <span class="yellow">patients</span> with high BLyS mRNA levels may be those <span class="yellow">patients</span> whose disease is strongly driven by BLyS and may be especially helped by BLyS antagonist therapy. Future clinical trials should be able to establish whether the BLyS mRNA levels are good predictors of response to such agents.<br><br>Conclusion
Plasma total immunoglobulin, IgG, and IgA levels and disease activity (as measured by SLEDAI) in SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> correlate more closely with peripheral blood leukocyte levels of BLyS mRNA than with plasma levels of BLyS protein. These findings suggest that BLyS mRNA levels better reflect in vivo BLyS production than do circulating BLyS protein levels, and may be a useful biomarker in the clinical monitoring of SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>. These findings also support the premise that BLyS overexpression not only promotes development of disease but also actively contributes to the ongoing maintenance of disease in SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>. This reinforces the rationale underlying clinical trials with BLyS antagonists in SLE.<br><br>Abbreviations

<h3>pmcA1551914</h3>Travel-Related Venous Thrombosis: Results from a Large Population-Based Case Control Study (MEGA Study)
Abstract
Background
Recent studies have indicated an increased risk of venous thrombosis after air travel. Nevertheless, questions on the magnitude of risk, the underlying mechanism, and modifying factors remain unanswered.<br><br>Methods and Findings
We studied the effect of various modes and duration of travel on the risk of venous thrombosis in a large ongoing case-control study on risk factors for venous thrombosis in an unselected population (MEGA study). We also assessed the combined effect of travel and prothrombotic mutations, body mass index, height, and oral contraceptive use.
Since March 1999, consecutive <span class="yellow">patients</span> younger than 70 y with a first venous thrombosis have been invited to participate in the study, with their partners serving as matched control individuals. Information has been collected on acquired and genetic risk factors for venous thrombosis. Of 1,906 <span class="yellow">patients</span>, 233 had traveled for more than 4 h in the 8 wk preceding the event. Traveling in general was found to increase the risk of venous thrombosis 2-fold (odds ratio [OR] 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5–3.0). The risk of flying was similar to the risks of traveling by car, bus, or train. The risk was highest in the first week after traveling. Travel by car, bus, or train led to a high relative risk of thrombosis in individuals with factor V Leiden (OR 8.1; 95% CI 2.7–24.7), in those who had a body mass index of more than 30 kg/m2 (OR 9.9; 95% CI 3.6–27.6), in those who were more than 1.90 m tall (OR 4.7; 95% CI 1.4–15.4), and in those who used oral contraceptives (estimated OR > 20). For air travel these synergistic findings were more apparent, while <span class="yellow">people</span> shorter than 1.60 m had an increased risk of thrombosis after air travel (OR 4.9; 95% CI 0.9–25.6) as well.<br><br>Conclusions
The risk of venous thrombosis after travel is moderately increased for all modes of travel. Subgroups exist in which the risk is highly increased.<br><br>
Background.
Recently there has been increasing concern that blood clots (thromboses) in the leg or lungs occur with greater frequency after air travel. Several theories have been put forward to explain why this increase might happen, including the fact that air passengers tend to not move around much, or possibly that reduced amounts of oxygen in the blood make the blood more likely to clot. Understanding what causes such clots is important as it would help us come up with suggestions of ways to prevent them.<br><br>Why Was This Study Done?
It is not possible to test in a controlled trial whether travel causes an increase in blood clots, so the next best way of studying this problem is to do a case-control study, in which <span class="yellow">people</span> with blood clots (cases) are compared with similar <span class="yellow">people</span> who don't have a blood clot (controls—in this case, the partners of the cases), and the differences in a number of contributing factors are assessed.<br><br>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
Since 1999, the MEGA (Multiple Environmental and Genetic Assessment of Risk Factors for Venous Thrombosis) study has aimed to identify all <span class="yellow">people</span> in an area of the Netherlands who develop a blood clot for the first time, by seeking out <span class="yellow">people</span> who receive treatment for blood clots. At the time of this report, 1,906 <span class="yellow">people</span> with clots had been found; of these, 233 had traveled for more than four hours in the eight weeks preceding the event. Traveling in general was found to increase the risk of clots two-fold, and the risk was highest in the week after traveling. The risk of flying was similar to the risk of traveling by car, bus, or train, and was highest in the first week after traveling. Certain other factors increased the risk of a blood clot even more, such as having a particular mutation (known as factor V Leiden) in a gene involved in blood clotting, having a body mass index of more than 30 kg/m2 (over 30 kg/m2 is defined as being obese), being more than 1.90 meters tall, and using oral contraceptives. All these factors made the risk of clots especially after air travel worse; in addition, <span class="yellow">people</span> shorter than 1.60 meters also had an increased risk of thrombosis after air travel. However, it should be borne in mind that the number of cases in each of these various groups was quite small, and the overall risk of getting a thrombosis is still low.<br><br>What Do These Findings Mean?
Since the risks of thrombosis are increased for all types of long travel, it seems that the main factor causing the thrombosis is immobility. However, since the risk is even higher for air travel, the relative lack of oxygen may also play a part. One interesting aspect of this study is that the researchers used partners as controls; in order to be sure that doing this did not make the results invalid, the researchers had to carefully adjust for differences between the cases and controls, such as the fact that partners were generally of the opposite sex. In a related Perspective (DOI: 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030300), Kenneth Rothman discusses the study further.<br><br>Additional Information.

Introduction
Interest in the role of air travel in the pathogenesis of venous thrombosis has heightened in the past 5 y [1–5]. Venous thrombosis was first linked to air travel in 1954 [6], and as air travel has become more and more common, many case reports and case series have been published since. Several clinical studies have shown an association between air travel and the risk of venous thrombosis. In a series of individuals who died suddenly at Heathrow Airport, death occurred far more often in the arrival than in the departure area [7]. Two similar studies described a “dose-response” relation: the risk of pulmonary embolism in air travelers increased with the distance traveled [5,8]. A number of case-control studies, however, have shown conflicting results [9–11]. More recently, a 2-fold increased risk in <span class="yellow">patients</span> who had traveled by air was described in a case-control study among 210 <span class="yellow">patients</span> and 210 controls [3]. A case-crossover study based on record linking in Australia described a 4-fold increased risk of venous thrombosis in the first 2 wk after a long-haul flight [1]. In terms of absolute risk, two studies found similar results: one performed in New Zealand found a frequency of 1% of venous thrombosis in 878 individuals who had traveled by air for at least 10 h [2], and a German study found venous thrombotic events in 2.8% of 964 individuals who had traveled for more than 8 h in an airplane, as compared to 1% in 1,213 controls [4]. The events in both studies were mostly asymptomatic.
The available evidence suggests that the overall risk of venous thrombosis is moderately increased after air travel. Nevertheless, many questions remain unanswered: the exact underlying mechanism is still unknown, and, related to this, it is not clear whether the risk is increased after air travel only or after long-distance travel in general. Furthermore, the effect of the combination of other risk factors for venous thrombosis and travel has not yet been systematically studied, with the exception of a study by Martinelli et al., who found an additionally increased risk in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with thrombophilia and <span class="yellow">patients</span> who used oral contraceptives [3].
The Multiple Environmental and Genetic Assessment (MEGA) study of risk factors for venous thrombosis is a large ongoing case-control study aimed at assessing the combined effect of genetic and acquired risk factors for venous thrombosis. Cases and control individuals are questioned about—among many other items—travel that occurred shortly before the event. This provides an opportunity to assess the effect of travel on the risk of thrombosis in an unselected population, as well as the effect of the combination of travel with several other risk factors for thrombosis.<br><br>Methods
Study Design
Since March 1999, consecutive <span class="yellow">patients</span> younger than 70 y with a first deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) have been identified at six regional anticoagulation clinics in the Netherlands. Anticoagulant clinics monitor the anticoagulant therapy of all <span class="yellow">patients</span> in a well-defined geographical area, allowing us to identify consecutive and unselected <span class="yellow">patients</span> with thrombosis. <span class="yellow">Patients</span> who were unable to fill in the questionnaire (because of language or severe psychiatric problems), as well as those who died soon after the venous thrombosis or who were in the end stage of a disease and for that reason did not participate, were not included. All others were considered eligible. Partners of these <span class="yellow">patients</span> were invited as control individuals, and the same exclusion criteria were applied.
All <span class="yellow">participants</span> filled in a detailed standardized questionnaire on general demographic and anthropomorphic characteristics, as well as risk factors for venous thrombosis. The questionnaire was sent to all <span class="yellow">participants</span> within a few weeks after the event and covered the period of 1 y prior to the date of the thrombotic event (index date). When the <span class="yellow">participant</span> was unable to fill in the questionnaire we asked questions by phone, using a standardized mini-questionnaire. Three months after the <span class="yellow">patients</span> had discontinued their oral anticoagulant therapy, they were invited with their partners to the anticoagulation clinic for a blood sample. In those <span class="yellow">patients</span> who continued to take oral anticoagulant therapy for more than 1 y after the event, blood was drawn during therapy. If <span class="yellow">participants</span> were unable to come to the clinic, a buccal swab was sent by mail to replace the blood sample for DNA extraction.
The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Leiden University Medical Center. Written informed consent was obtained from all <span class="yellow">participants</span> [12].<br><br>Validation Study of Thrombosis Diagnosis
Discharge letters or diagnostic reports of the venous thrombotic event were obtained for a sample of 742 <span class="yellow">patients</span> who had their first thrombosis between March 1999 and March 2000. The diagnostic management of the <span class="yellow">patients</span> was compared to the diagnostic procedure as described in the Dutch consensus [13]. Diagnosis of clinically suspected DVT of the leg is based on a clinical score, serial compression ultrasonography, and D-dimer assay. Objective testing of clinically suspected pulmonary embolism is based on perfusion and ventilation scintigraphy, ultrasonography of the leg veins, pulmonary angiography, or helical computed tomography. Out of 395 <span class="yellow">patients</span> with DVT of the leg, 384 (97%) were objectively diagnosed, while out of 347 <span class="yellow">patients</span> with PE, 271 (78%) were confirmed with objective testing as certainly having PE. Since the diagnosis appears to be made by objective methods in virtually all cases of DVT, while being more ambiguous for PE, we also analyzed these two manifestations of venous thrombosis separately.<br><br>Current Analysis
For the current analysis we were interested in the effects of travel, and its combined effect with other common risk factors for venous thrombosis. <span class="yellow">Patients</span> with a solitary arm thrombosis were excluded from this analysis. Of 3,902 eligible cases, diagnosed up to May 2002, 656 did not participate for various reasons (such as not willing or not reachable), leading to a response of 83%. A further 3% responded only to the mini-questionnaire, taken by phone, which did not contain questions about travel. Of the remaining 3,111 cases, 78% had a partner, 77% of whom were willing to participate, which left 1,867 couples. Additionally, 229 partners were identified for whom the corresponding <span class="blue">patient</span> originally participated but was later found not to be eligible (aged over 70 y, or not a first thrombotic event). These control individuals were matched on sex and 5-y age groups to one of the 557 <span class="yellow">patients</span> whose partner did not want to participate, so an extra 229 pairs were included, making a total of 4,192 <span class="yellow">participants</span> (2,096 pairs). As part of the general questionnaire, questions had been asked about whether or not respondents had traveled for more than 4 h in the 3 mo before the index date, about the travel date, and about mode and duration of travel. We assessed the occurrence of thrombosis in relation to the period of time that had passed since traveling. Travel was defined in the analysis as at least one journey with a duration of at least four uninterrupted hours during the 8-wk period before the event. During the analysis it appeared that some individuals had provided dates of travel after the event instead of before. As there was only one opportunity to fill in such a date, we had no information about the period before the event. This was the case in 88 cases and 146 controls. We excluded these individuals and their partners, which left 3,812 <span class="yellow">participants</span> (1,906 pairs) for the analysis.
Because we selected the partners of the cases as control individuals, and because it turned out, as expected, that couples tend to travel together, we performed a conditional logistic regression analysis to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for the relation between travel and venous thrombosis. This method fully takes this matching into account, and leads to unbiased estimates, with adjustment for all factors in which cases and controls tend to be similar, e.g., socioeconomic class [14]. Details of this method can be found in Protocol S1. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived from the model.
We assessed the combined effect of traveling and the following risk factors for thrombosis: factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin G20210A mutation, body mass index (BMI, as kg/m2), and height. We were also interested in the combined effect of oral contraceptive use and travel. However, as the control individuals were nearly always of the opposite sex (partners of the cases were recruited as controls), it was not possible to perform a matched analysis for the combination of oral contraceptive use and travel. Therefore, we performed a case-only analysis [15]. This method allows one to examine the association between two exposures among case individuals only. ORs are interpreted as a synergy index (SI) on a multiplicative scale, with independence assumed between the exposures. As this analysis depends only on cases, it was possible to perform it in all consecutive cases, therefore also including those without a partner.<br><br>Laboratory Measurements
Blood was collected from the antecubital vein into vacuum tubes containing 0.106 mol/l trisodium citrate. High molecular weight DNA was isolated from leukocytes using a standard salting-out procedure [16] and stored at −20 °C. When a blood sample was not available, DNA was extracted from buccal swabs. Three large <span class="yellow">cotton</span> swabs in a total of 6 ml of SDS–proteinase K solution (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 0.5% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K) were obtained. Upon arrival, the proteinase K concentration was raised to 0.2 mg/ml, and the sample was incubated for 2 h at 65 °C. Subsequently, the solute was recovered by centrifugation. Potassium acetate was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 1.6 M. After 15 min incubation on ice, proteins were removed using chloroform/isomylalcohol (24:1) treatment. The DNA in the water phase was subsequently ethanol precipitated. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl and 10 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), and frozen at −20 °C until further analysis. The factor V Leiden mutation (G1691A) and the prothrombin mutation (G20210A) were simultaneously detected by duplex polymerase chain reaction [17,18]. The technician was blinded concerning the origin of the sample, i.e., whether it was from a <span class="blue">patient</span> or from a control individual.<br><br>
Results
Venous Thrombosis in Relation to Travel
Table 1 shows general characteristics of the 1,906 <span class="yellow">patients</span>. They ranged in age from 18 to 69 y (median 50.4 y); 51% were <span class="yellow">men</span>. Diagnosis was DVT in 57% of the cases, PE in 32%, and both in 11%. As partners of the cases were included as control individuals, the sex distribution of the control individuals was the opposite; the age distribution differed only trivially.
Of the <span class="yellow">patients</span>, 233 individuals (12%) had traveled for at least 4 h by air, bus, car, or train within the 8 wk preceding the index date, as compared to 182 of the control individuals (9.5%). As the cases and control individuals were selected as couples, many pairs (135) had traveled together and were uninformative: as a consequence, 145 pairs in which either the <span class="blue">patient</span> (98) or the control (47) had traveled could be used for the matched analysis (Table 2). This analysis showed a 2-fold increased risk of venous thrombosis for all modes of travel combined (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.5–3.0) compared to not traveling. For air travel alone, 49 individuals (31 cases and 18 controls) had traveled without their partner, and the analysis yielded an OR of 1.7 (95% CI 1.0–3.1). For the other modes of travel (car, bus, and train) the relative risks were essentially similar to each other and to that of air travel (Table 2).
The risk of venous thrombosis was not clearly related to increased duration of travel (Table 2). Of the 233 events that occurred within 8 wk after traveling, 68 (29%) were diagnosed in the first week, after which the incidence gradually decreased (Figure 1).<br><br>The Effect of Other Risk Factors Combined with Travel
Prothrombotic mutations.
Information on the factor V Leiden mutation and prothrombin G20210A genotype was available for 1,713 <span class="yellow">patients</span> (90%) and for 1,629 of the control individuals (85%). Factor V Leiden was present in 259 cases (14%) and 84 control individuals (4%) (OR 3.1; 95% CI 2.4–4.1).
The risk of venous thrombosis was 8-fold increased in <span class="yellow">people</span> with factor V Leiden who had traveled by bus, car, or train (modes combined) as compared to noncarriers who did not travel (OR 8.1; 95% CI 2.7–24.7). For the combined effect of air travel and factor V Leiden, the risk seemed even slightly higher (OR 13.6; 95% CI 2.9–64.2).
The prothrombin G20210A mutation was found in 83 cases (4%) and in 29 control individuals (2%) (OR 2.7; 95% CI 1.7–4.2). The risk in individuals with this mutation who had traveled was difficult to interpret because of the small numbers but appeared not to increase more than additively (Table 3).<br><br>BMI.
The effect of BMI was studied by dividing individuals into three categories with the following BMI values: <25, 25–30, and >30 kg/m2 [19]. A BMI of 25–30 kg/m2 was associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis (OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.2–1.7), and the risk was slightly higher in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or more (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.4–2.1).
The combined effect of a higher BMI and travel was the sum of the individual risks (Table 3), with the exception of <span class="yellow">people</span> with a BMI of more than 30 kg/m2 who traveled by car, bus, or train, for whom the risk was 10-fold increased (OR 9.9; 95% CI 3.6–27.6). This increase in risk was not found in <span class="yellow">people</span> who traveled by air.<br><br>Height.
Particularly short or tall <span class="yellow">people</span> may be subjected during travel to even more unnatural sitting positions than individuals with average height. Therefore, we assessed the effect of extremes of heights in combination with travel on the risk of venous thrombosis by comparing short (less than 1.60 m) and tall individuals (more than 1.90 m) with <span class="yellow">people</span> of average height (1.60–1.90 m). Compared to <span class="yellow">people</span> of average height, the risk of venous thrombosis was lower for short <span class="yellow">people</span> (OR 0.7; 95% CI 0.5–0.9) and did not differ for very tall individuals (OR 0.9; 95% CI 0.7–1.1). The risk was found to be increased in <span class="yellow">people</span> of more than 1.90 m who traveled (OR 4.7; 95% CI 1.4–15.4 for travel by car, bus, or train; OR 6.8; 95% CI 0.8–60.6 for air travel) compared to non-traveling <span class="yellow">people</span> of average height. Interestingly, the risk of venous thrombosis was also increased in short <span class="yellow">people</span> but only after air travel (OR 4.9; 95% CI 0.9–25.6), not after other modes of travel (OR 1.0; 95% CI 0.3–2.8, all relative to non-traveling <span class="yellow">people</span> of average height).<br><br>Oral contraception.
To study the association between oral contraceptive use, travel, and the risk of venous thrombosis, we performed a case-only analysis in all female <span class="yellow">patients</span> who were less than 50 y of age. As we needed only cases, it was also possible to include <span class="yellow">women</span> without a partner for this analysis, which led to a total of 1,025 <span class="yellow">women</span> aged under 50. Non-users who did not travel were used as the reference group. The case-only estimate of the SI for <span class="yellow">women</span> who traveled by car, bus, or train was 2.4 (95% CI 1.5–3.7). This indicates that the OR for the combination of travel and oral contraceptive use is 2.4 times the product of the separate ORs. As oral contraceptive use generally increases the risk of venous thrombosis about 4-fold [20], the combination with travel by car, bus, or train would lead to an estimated OR of about 20 (4 × 2 × 2.4). A clearly stronger interaction of travel by air with oral contraceptive use was found: the case-only estimate of the SI was 4.9 (95% CI 2.1– 11.4), which would result in an OR of about 40 (4 × 2 × 4.9).<br><br>
Effect of Risk Factors in DVT <span class="yellow">Patients</span> Only
Of the 1,906 cases, 1,082 were diagnosed with DVT. As the diagnosis was more unambiguous in these <span class="yellow">patients</span> (97% objectively diagnosed as compared to 78% of the PE <span class="yellow">patients</span>), we repeated the analysis in these <span class="yellow">patients</span> only.
In this analysis, the overall effect of travel on the risk of DVT was equal to the effect on all venous thrombosis (DVT and PE combined). However, here we found a stronger risk for travel by air (OR 3.0; 95% CI 1.3–7.1) then for travel by car, bus, or train (OR 1.9; 95% CI 1.1–3.2) (Table 4). Also, the analysis of the combination of other risk factors with travel resulted in more clear-cut effects, despite the smaller number of cases: the risk of DVT was still clearly synergistically increased in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with factor V Leiden who traveled, whereas the prothrombin G20210A mutation did not further increase the risk of travel (Table 4). Furthermore, a BMI of more than 30 kg/m2 in combination with travel yielded high ORs for DVT both in <span class="yellow">people</span> who traveled by car, bus, or train and in those who flew. Being more than 1.90 m tall in combination with travel resulted in higher ORs for DVT; the risk for short <span class="yellow">people</span> was more increased after travel by air (OR 6.8; 95% CI 1.1–43.5) (Table 4). The effect of oral contraceptive use in combination with travel by car, bus, or train on the risk of DVT was studied in 589 <span class="yellow">women</span> and was somewhat lower than the effect on the risk of all venous thrombosis (SI 1.9; 95% CI 0.9–4.2). In those who traveled by air it was also a bit lower (SI 3.4; 95% CI 1.3–8.8), but still indicative of a strong synergistic effect.<br><br>
Discussion
In this population-based case-control study, long-distance traveling increased the risk of venous thrombosis 2-fold. Travel by air increased the risk to the same extent as travel by car, bus, or train. The risk was highest in the first week after traveling. As venous thrombosis is a disease in which many factors (genetic and acquired) interact [21], we identified groups with additional risk factors in which the risk was further increased. This was the case for individuals with factor V Leiden, obese <span class="yellow">people</span> (BMI > 30 kg/m2), and short (only for travel by air) and tall <span class="yellow">people</span>, as well as for <span class="yellow">women</span> using oral contraceptives. Some of these synergistic effects were more apparent for air travel.
Although the studies that have been published so far have not yielded entirely consistent results, those that did report an increased risk of venous thrombosis in air travelers showed similar risk estimates of a 2- to 3-fold increased risk (even in one with asymptomatic events only [4]). The occurrence of venous thrombosis was highest in the first week after travel, and slowly declined afterwards, a pattern that was also described in a recent record-linking study from Australia [1], supporting a causal relation.
As a possible mechanism for an extra risk in travelers who <span class="yellow">fly</span>, an effect of hypobaric hypoxia on the coagulation system was postulated, which has already been studied a number of times, mainly in hypobaric chambers, with unclear results so far. Our study showed an increased risk in all types of travel, which suggests that the increased risk of flying is caused mainly by immobilization. Additionally, the risk is further increased in short and tall <span class="yellow">people</span>, who are likely to experience more immobilization and venous compression than other travelers. However, as some of our findings were more pronounced for air travel, we cannot exclude an additional effect of hypobaric hypoxia, possibly in risk groups only. This possibility is supported by a recent study of our group [22] in which we found that thrombin generation occurred in some healthy volunteers after flying for 8 h but happened to a far lesser extent after being immobilized for 8 h in a cinema. The high response in the fliers was associated with the presence of risk factors for thrombosis, i.e., oral contraceptive use, the factor V Leiden mutation, and the combination of the two. This finding indicates an effect of an additional factor in an airplane, such as hypobaric hypoxia, to which mainly individuals with risk factors respond.
None of the studies published so far have systematically studied the effect of traveling in combination with other risk factors, with the exception of the study by Martinelli et al. [3]. In an analysis of 210 <span class="yellow">patients</span>, they found a 16-fold increased risk for <span class="yellow">patients</span> who traveled by air and had some form of thrombophilia, as well as a 14-fold increased risk in <span class="yellow">women</span> who flew and used oral contraceptives, findings that confirm both the results of the present study and our finding of activated coagulation in individuals with risk factors after flying [22].
The finding that taller and shorter <span class="yellow">people</span> had an increased risk of venous thrombosis after traveling should be interpreted with some caution, as the numbers were small in these strata. On the other hand, it is biologically plausible: very tall <span class="yellow">people</span> are subjected to even more cramped seating than average-height individuals, and very short <span class="yellow">people</span>'s feet may not touch the floor, which would lead to extra compression of the popliteal veins. Interestingly, the increased risk for short <span class="yellow">people</span> was only found in <span class="yellow">people</span> who traveled by air. This may have to do with the fact that seats in cars are generally lower, and more individually adjustable, than those in airplanes.
As the diagnosis of DVT is usually more unambiguous than that of PE [23], as was the case in our study population as well, we repeated the analysis using only DVT as the outcome of interest (97% objectively diagnosed). In this analysis, despite using smaller numbers, most findings were either similar or appeared more evident, and inconsistencies that were found when using both DVT and PE as endpoints disappeared.
To our knowledge, this is the first large population-based case-control study in which the effect of travel on the risk of venous thrombosis has been studied. Because the control individuals were closely matched, being partners of the cases, and couples tend to travel together, only the cases and control individuals who had not traveled together could be used for the analysis. Also because of this design, the effect of sex and age could not be studied. It has to be noted, however, that for all other research questions on the effect of genetic and acquired risk factors on the risk of venous thrombosis, this design has no limitations and the close matching of cases and controls renders confounding by, for instance, lifestyle and socioeconomic class less likely than in previous unmatched studies (see also Protocol S1). Another advantage of this approach is the minimization of recall bias, as the cases and controls would generally fill in the questionnaire together.
Many questions are still left unanswered that necessitate more research. First of all, our study results apply only to <span class="yellow">people</span> younger than 70 y of age. Furthermore, it is likely that other characteristics exist that also increase the risk—<span class="yellow">person</span>-specific (e.g., other drug use), behavioral (e.g., use of sleeping pills or alcohol consumption), and flight-specific (e.g., class or seating)—that need to be identified. These further variables are part of our ongoing study as part of the World Health Organization Research Initiative into the Global Hazards of Travel (WRIGHT study). For those who have an increased risk, such as oral contraceptive users and individuals with factor V Leiden, prevention may be warranted. Prevention may vary from simple measures, such as exercises during the flight, to measures that carry a risk themselves, such as anticoagulants. Specific studies are needed to assess the efficacy of these measures and their risk–benefit ratio.
It can be concluded that the risk of venous thrombosis is 2-fold increased for all travelers and to the same extent for all modes of travel. In individuals who use oral contraceptives, are carriers of the factor V Leiden mutation, or are particularly tall, short, or obese, this risk is considerably higher, to such an extent that studies into the efficacy of prophylactic measures are required.<br><br>Supporting Information<br><br>
<h3>pmcA1621059</h3>Case report: rapidly fatal bowel ischaemia on clozapine treatment
Abstract
Background
There have been previous reported deaths due to clozapine-induced constipation. In all these cases <span class="yellow">patients</span> have experienced prior abdominal symptoms over a period of weeks or months.<br><br>Case presentation
We report the sudden death due to constipation of a healthy young male <span class="blue">patient</span> on clozapine without any known history of prior abdominal symptoms.<br><br>Conclusion
Psychiatrists need to be alert to the medical emergencies which can occur in the context of clozapine treatment and also need to make other clinicians who may have contact with their <span class="yellow">patients</span> aware of these.<br><br><br><br>Background
There have been six previously published cases of death secondary to clozapine-induced constipation [1-3]. Of these, two <span class="yellow">patients</span> died from faecal peritonitis, two from aspiration of faeculent vomitus as a result of bowel obstruction and two from bowel necrosis. In all these cases there had been prior complaints of constipation and/or other abdominal symptoms for weeks to months before the fatal event. Here we describe a case of constipation, presumably clozapine-induced, where death from bowel ischaemia occured within 2 days from the first complaint of constipation and without any prior reported abdominal symptoms which might have provided a warning to the clinicians involved.<br><br>Case presentation
A 20-year-old male with a year long history of schizophrenia which had been unresponsive to trials of two atypical antipsychotic drugs was commenced on clozapine. The dose was titrated over the next year to 900 mg daily. Due to persisting negative symptoms amisulpiride 400 mg twice daily was added with good response after one month. The <span class="blue">patient</span> was reviewed regularly over the next year, continued to improve and did not report any side effects to members of the multidisciplinary mental health team working to support him in the community. He appeared to be fit and healthy. Although he usually lived in supported accommodation he was staying temporarily with his family and from their account he complained of having constipation for 2 days before presenting to his GP with severe abdominal pain. He was prescribed medication and returned home but his condition deteriorated further and a few hours later an ambulance was called. He collapsed and died before reaching hospital. Post mortem examination revealed that he had impacted faeces which had pressed against the bowel wall causing ischaemia. This had led to infarction of this part of the bowel.<br><br>Conclusion
This case demonstrates that death can occur over a very short time course from constipation, in this case presumably induced by clozapine. Death from constipation and subsequent bowel infarction is relatively common in elderly <span class="yellow">patients</span> and infarction causes a far more rapid and dangerous deterioration than does intestinal obstruction. In the present case this meant that this <span class="blue">patient</span> did not have any contact with psychiatric services between the onset of his symptoms and his rapid demise, in spite of regular follow-up. Although the risk of neutropenia is relatively well-known, it should be borne in mind that clozapine is reported to be associated with a number of other syndromes which may be rapidly fatal including not only constipation and obstruction but also cardiovascular collapse, seizures and ketoacidosis. Psychiatrists working with such <span class="yellow">patients</span> should not only themselves be vigilant regarding such complications but should take steps to see that other clinicians to whom the <span class="blue">patient</span> may present are also aware of them.<br><br>Competing interests

Abstract
Background
No validated disease-specific measures are available to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in adult subjects with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Therefore, we sought to develop and validate the ITP-<span class="yellow">Patient</span> Assessment Questionnaire (ITP-PAQ) for adult subjects with ITP.<br><br>Methods
Information from literature reviews, focus groups with subjects, and clinicians were used to develop 50 ITP-PAQ items. Factor analyses were conducted to develop the scale structure and reduce the number of items. The final 44-item ITP-PAQ, which includes ten scales [Symptoms (S), Bother-Physical Health (B), Fatigue/Sleep (FT), Activity (A), Fear (FR), Psychological Health (PH), Work (W), Social Activity (SA), <span class="yellow">Women</span>'s Reproductive Health (RH), and Overall (QoL)], was self-administered to adult ITP subjects at baseline and 7–10 days later. Test-retest reliability, internal consistency reliability, construct and known groups validity of the final ITP-PAQ were evaluated.<br><br>Results
Seventy-three subjects with ITP completed the questionnaire twice. Test-retest reliability, as measured by the intra-class correlation, ranged from 0.52–0.90. Internal consistency reliability was demonstrated with Cronbach's alpha for all scales above the acceptable level of 0.70 (range: 0.71–0.92), except for RH (0.66). Construct validity, assessed by correlating ITP-PAQ scales with established measures (Short Form-36 v.1, SF-36 and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, CES-D), was demonstrated through moderate correlations between the ITP-PAQ SA and SF-36 Social Function scales (r = 0.67), and between ITP-PAQ PH and SF-36 Mental Health Scales (r = 0.63). Moderate to strong inter-scale correlations were reported between ITP-PAQ scales and the CES-D, except for the RH scale. Known groups validity was evaluated by comparing mean scores for groups that differed clinically. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.01) were observed when subjects were categorized by treatment status [S, FT, B, A, PH, and QoL, perceived effectiveness of ITP treatment [S], and time elapsed since ITP diagnosis [PH].<br><br>Conclusion
Results provide preliminary evidence of the reliability and validity of the ITP-PAQ in adult subjects with ITP. Further work should be conducted to assess the responsiveness and to estimate the minimal clinical important difference of the ITP-PAQ to more fully understand the impact of ITP and its treatments on HRQoL.<br><br><br><br>Background
Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a disorder characterized by autoimmune-mediated platelet destruction and suboptimal platelet production [1-3] that results in a decrease in the number of circulating platelets and increases the risk of bleeding events. The estimated prevalence rate for ITP in the United States is 9.5/100,000 [4]. Adult <span class="yellow">women</span> are disproportionately affected by the disorder, with a female to male ratio of nearly two to one [5]. The disorder rarely remits spontaneously in adult subjects [1]. The mortality rate is relatively low (< 1%) [6] in adults less than 65 years of age. Morbidity increases above age 65, primarily as a result of an increase in age-related major bleeding events [7].
Initial therapy for ITP consists of some combination of glucocorticoids, intravenous immune globulin (IVIg) or anti-D [8]. Splenectomy is often considered if these therapies fail. Approximately two-thirds of <span class="yellow">patients</span> treated with splenectomy achieve a sustained remission [1,5,9]. <span class="yellow">Patients</span> who fail splenectomy are treated with a wide variety of agents including corticosteroids, danazol, and chemotherapeutic agents. Morbidity and mortality in these refractory <span class="yellow">patients</span> are substantial [1,6,8].
<span class="yellow">Patient</span>-reported outcomes (PRO), including health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measures, are critical components for evaluating and understanding treatment effects from the subject's perspective. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indicates that PRO measures are important to assess because they may: 1) detect treatment effects known only to the subject; 2) understand the subject's perspective regarding treatment effect; or 3) provide information not included in a clinician's subject notes [10]. Furthermore, the Committee for Medicinal Products for <span class="yellow">Human</span> Use of the European Medicines Agency defines HRQoL as "the subject's subjective perception of the impact of his disease and its treatment(s) on his daily life, physical, psychological and social functioning and well-being" [11].
Currently, limited data are available on the assessment of the impact of symptoms in adult subjects with ITP. Symptoms of ITP, such as spontaneous bruising, menorrhagia, mucosal bleeding and prolonged bleeding with injury, may significantly affect HRQoL in ITP subjects [12]. Treatments for chronic ITP can also be associated with substantial side effects [5,8]. In addition, subjects who are resistant to current therapies are likely to experience an even greater decrement to their HRQoL than responders to treatment. Thus, restoring and/or maintaining quality of life should be an important goal of treatment. While the primary markers for ITP include hematologic measures such as platelet counts, clinical measures typically do not assess a subject's functioning and well-being. Therefore, subjects and physicians may want to weigh the impact of ITP therapies on HRQoL endpoints when making treatment decisions.
Previously, no validated disease-specific measures were available to evaluate quality of life in adult ITP subjects; however, two disease-specific HRQoL questionnaires have been developed for use in <span class="yellow">children</span> with ITP [13,14]. Thus, we sought to develop a questionnaire that would be appropriate to assess the impact of ITP symptoms and its treatments on HRQoL in adult subjects. The objective of this current manuscript is to describe the development and initial validation of a newly developed HRQoL questionnaire for use in adult subjects with ITP.<br><br>Methods
Overview
A newly developed questionnaire, which assesses issues of importance to ITP subjects, was developed based on available published literature, existing questionnaires, expert clinical opinion, and input from subjects with ITP.<br><br>Subjects and Procedures
To develop the questionnaire, three focus groups with ITP subjects were conducted in geographically diverse locations (San Diego, CA, New York, NY, and Oklahoma City, OK). Each of the three sites recruited a convenience sample of five to eight ITP subjects who were being treated on an outpatient basis. To be eligible, subjects were required to have active disease and be ≥ 18 years of age. Although platelet count data were not required for participation in the focus groups, clinicians at each site considered the subjects to have active disease, usually an indication that platelet levels have dropped below 120 × 109L and the subject requires treatment and/or more frequent monitoring. In total, 23 ITP subjects participated in the focus groups after providing their informed consent.
To validate the questionnaire, a convenience sample of subjects was recruited from the same three clinical sites in New York, NY, Oklahoma City, OK, and La Jolla, CA. Subjects were eligible if they were ≥ 18 years of age, had active disease, and were willing to complete a self-administered questionnaire at two time points. Target enrollment was roughly 72 subjects (24 subjects from each site).
The study protocol was approved by a local institutional review board at each site and was carried out in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject prior to enrollment.<br><br>Creation of Questionnaire/Item Selection
A trained moderator led all focus groups using a detailed discussion guide. Subjects discussed their ITP history, treatment, ITP symptoms, and the impact of ITP on daily activities. Each focus group lasted approximately three hours, and subjects were provided with an honorarium for their time. Following the focus group session, all subjects completed a questionnaire which included the SF-36 v1 [15] and ITP-specific questions. The ITP-specific items were developed based on clinical input [12,16-18]. The ITP-specific items assessed the impact of ITP on the subject's overall quality of life, relationships, ability to sleep, menstruation/gynecological history, and sexual activity. The ITP-specific questions also assessed the subject's response to ITP treatments and any side effects. Transcripts of the focus groups were summarized and reviewed by the study team. The initial draft of the ITP Subject Assessment Questionnaire (ITP-PAQ) was developed after reviewing information from the literature searches, existing questionnaires, expert opinion, focus group transcripts, and the questionnaire responses from the focus group subjects.
The initial ITP-PAQ consisted of 50 items that assesses the impact of ITP in the areas of physical health, mental health, work, social activity, reproductive health (relevant for <span class="yellow">women</span> only), and overall quality of life. Factor analyses were conducted which yielded six unique domains. The impact of ITP on physical health was measured by four scales that evaluated ITP-related symptoms, Fatigue/Sleep, Bother-Physical Health, and Activity. Its impact on mental health was measured by two scales that evaluated psychological distress and fear. A copy of the questionnaire can be obtained by contacting Janet L. Nichol and sample items are included Table 2.<br><br>Statistical Analyses
A validation study was conducted to evaluate the psychometric properties of the newly developed ITP-PAQ questionnaire so that it could be used to measure the impact of ITP in adult subjects in future studies. Standard psychometric methods were used to evaluate the reliability and validity of the questionnaire [19,20].
Eligible subjects completed the baseline questionnaire at the site or by mail after providing telephone consent. An informed consent form and baseline questionnaire was mailed to those subjects who gave their initial consent via telephone. These completed documents were returned by mail to the investigators. At follow up, each subject was mailed the same questionnaire and asked to complete it a second time (for evaluating test-retest reliability) approximately two weeks later. Additionally, subjects completed the SF-36 and the CES-D[21] for validation purposes at both assessments. Demographic and clinical characteristics were also solicited in order to more fully describe the study population. Each study subject received an honorarium for completing the questionnaires.<br><br>Scale creation and confirmatory factor analysis
Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to test the hypothesized structure of the scales. Two models using LISREL version 8 were tested [22]. The first model consisted of all 50 HRQoL items and 10 factors, whereas the second model consisted of a subset of the 50-item correlation matrix. Only <span class="yellow">women</span> respond to the six items comprising the Reproductive Health scale, so the items were not included in the second LISREL model to avoid estimation biases. The remaining 44 items were analyzed. Model fit was evaluated using the goodness-of-fit (GFI), the normed fit index (NFI), the non-normed fit index (NNFI), the comparative fit index (CIF), and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). For the confirmatory models, index values greater than 0.95 indicate better fit, and RMSEA values less than 0.05 are considered evidence of adequate fit [23].<br><br>Reliability and stability
Two forms of reliability were assessed: test-retest reliability and internal consistency reliability. Test-retest reliability, a measure of the degree to which the questionnaire yields stable scores over a short period of time (assuming there is no underlying change), was measured by the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) [24,25]. An ICC of ≥ 0.70 was considered acceptable [26].
Internal consistency reliability, the extent to which items within each scale correlate with each other to form a multi-item scale, was assessed using Cronbach's alpha [25,27]. Data from both assessments were used to evaluate internal consistency reliability. An alpha coefficient of ≥ 0.70 was considered acceptable, which is the commonly accepted minimal standard for reliability coefficients endorsed by the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Medical Outcomes Trust [26].<br><br>Construct Validity
Construct validity was assessed by examining the inter-scale correlations between the ITP-PAQ and the CES-D and the ITP-PAQ with the SF-36 and by examining the strength of the within ITP-PAQ scale correlations [25,28]. For both inter-scale and intra-scale correlations, we made a priori hypotheses about the directionality and magnitude of the correlation and observed the extent to which hypothesized relationships held. For example, we hypothesized that the scales of the ITP-PAQ would be negatively correlated with the CES-D and positively correlated with those of the SF-36. We expected the Pearson correlations to be moderate in size.<br><br>Known Groups
Known groups validity evaluates the ability of the measure to discriminate between groups known to be clinically different [28]. We only collected <span class="blue">patient</span>-reported information using the questionnaire and did not collect clinical information such as platelet counts. Therefore, the following four criteria were identified as proxies for severity:
• Currently on treatment
• Splenectomy status
• Subjects' self-perception of the effectiveness of current medication
• Length of time since diagnosis
It was hypothesized that subjects not being treated, who did not have a splenectomy, who perceived their medication to be more effective, and who had been diagnosed with ITP for a longer time would be healthier and therefore report higher HRQoL scores. In contrast, subjects on any treatment, who had received a splenectomy, who perceived their medication to be less effective, and who were diagnosed more recently would report worse HRQoL. In addition, subjects were also categorized by gender. Subjects were categorized into two groups for each of the analyses: female vs. male, intact spleen vs. removed spleen, currently on ITP treatment vs. not currently on ITP treatment, subject's perception of the effectiveness of their current ITP medication (extremely/moderately effective vs. not at all effective), and ITP diagnosis less than one year ago vs. ITP diagnosis more than one year ago.<br><br>
Results
Demographics and clinical characteristics
Table 1 describes the demographic and clinical characteristics of the 73 subjects included in the validation analyses. The majority were female (77%) and Caucasian (84%). The mean age was 45 years (SD = 15.7), and most of the subjects had been diagnosed with ITP for at least five years (57%). Fifty-two percent of the subjects reported that they were currently taking medications for their ITP. Furthermore, 58% indicated that they had a splenectomy. Among the 42 subjects who had a splenectomy, 55% reported that the removal of their spleen did not cure their ITP. With one exception, the remaining subjects did not provide a response.<br><br>Confirmatory factor analysis
The first confirmatory factor analysis of the 50-item and ten factors model converged in 28 iterations. However, neither the inter-item correlation matrix nor the inter-factor correlation matrix was positive-definite, which suggests that the proposed model is wrong for the data or the data are inadequate for the model[22]. The chi-square value of the model was 316.64 with 1129 degrees of freedom (p = 1.0), which does not support the hypothesized scale structure of the initial ITP-PAQ. The confirmatory analysis of this LISREL model indicate that computing domain scores for the Physical Health and Mental Health domains is not appropriate for the ITP-PAQ.
The second LISREL model was analyzed to confirm the scale structure, excluding the Reproductive Health scale. For this model, 126 parameters were estimated: 46 factor loadings, 44 error terms, and 36 inter-factor correlations. The model converged in 39 iterations, with a chi-square value of 1043.10 with 864 degrees of freedom (p < 0.01). The Goodness of Fit Index (GFI), Normed Fit Index (NFI), Non-normed Fit Index (NNFI), and Comparative Fit Index (CFI) was 0.60, 0.63, 0.91, and 0.92, respectively, and the RMSEA was 0.05 [90% CI, 0.04–0.065]. Furthermore, the inter-factor correlations ranged form 0.33 between the Symptoms and Work scales to 0.96 between the Bother-Physical Health and Overall QoL scales.
In addition to the confirmatory factor analyses, Cronbach's alphas and item-to-total correlations were used for item reduction. Items with low factor loadings and item-to-total correlations that reduced the internal consistency were eliminated. Although initial factor analyses identified six domains for future use, the final version of the ITP-PAQ contained 44 items that included the following ten scales: Symptoms, Bother-Physical Health, Fatigue/Sleep, Activity, Fear, Psychological Health, Work, Social Activity, <span class="yellow">Women</span>'s Reproductive Health, and Overall QoL. Table 2 provides information on the number of items, item variability and sample items from each scale of the questionnaire. Each scale is scored from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing better quality of life.<br><br>Test-retest reliability
Of the 73 subjects who completed the first administration of the questionnaire, most of the subjects completed the second questionnaire within a 15-day period (75%), during which subjects were expected to remain clinically stable. However, 20% of the 73 subjects completed the questionnaire within three weeks following the first administration. The remaining 5% of subjects completed it between four and nine weeks after the first "test." ICC's were computed for the entire sample (n = 73) and for a sub-sample of respondents who completed the second questionnaire within three weeks (n = 69). With the exception of the Bother-Physical Health and Activity scales, all scales had acceptable test-retest reliability (ICC ≥ 0.70) as measured by the ICC (Table 3). For the entire sample, ICC values ranged from 0.52–0.90, while ICC values for the sub-sample ranged from 0.56–0.89.<br><br>Internal consistency reliability
Internal consistency reliability, measured by Cronbach's alpha, ranged from 0.66 to 0.92 (Table 3). With the exception of the Reproductive Health scale, Cronbach's alpha coefficients exceeded the acceptable level of 0.70. Cronbach's alpha for the Symptoms, Bother-Physical Health, Fatigue/Sleep, and Activity scales ranged from 0.71–0.89, while Cronbach's alpha for the Psychological Health and Fear scales ranged from 0.87–0.92. Additionally, Cronbach's alphas for the Social Activity, Work, Reproductive Health, and Overall QoL scales were 0.72, 0.86, 0.66, and 0.89, respectively.<br><br>Construct validity
Table 4 displays the results of inter-scale Pearson correlation coefficients for the initial test administration of the ITP-PAQ. As expected, the Symptoms, Bother-Physical Health, Fatigue/Sleep, and Activity scales were moderately to strongly inter-correlated based on the data from the initial administration (correlation coefficients ranged from 0.56–0.75; p < 0.05). The Overall QoL scale was moderately to strongly correlated with the other ITP-PAQ scales, with the exception of the Reproductive Health scale.
In addition to examining the correlations within the ITP-PAQ scales, construct validity was also assessed by comparing the ITP-PAQ scale scores with those of the CES-D and the SF-36. The CES-D was negatively correlated with all ITP-PAQ scales, except for the Reproductive Health scale. Other than the Reproductive Health scale, Pearson correlations ranged from -0.37 to -0.70 (p < 0.05) (data not shown). Most of the ITP-PAQ scales were moderately correlated with the SF-36 scales; however, the Reproductive Health scale was not significantly correlated with any of the SF-36 scales.
The mean SF-36 scores of the subjects with ITP were compared to those of the general U.S. population norms [15]. Results from t-tests indicate that there were statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in SF-36 mean scores between subjects with ITP (range, 43.04–72.86) and the general U.S. population (range, 60.86–84.15). Subjects with ITP reported lower scores on each SF-36 scale compared to the US norm (data not shown).<br><br>Known groups validity
Subjects were categorized into two groups according to gender, splenectomy status, current ITP treatment status, subject's perception of the effectiveness of ITP treatment, and time elapsed since ITP diagnosis. When subjects were grouped according to gender or splenectomy status, no statistically significant differences were observed for any of the ITP-PAQ scales (data not shown). Subjects who were currently receiving treatment for ITP reported lower scores on all ITP-PAQ scales compared to subjects who were not currently receiving treatment. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.01) were reported for the following ITP-PAQ scales when subjects were categorized by treatment status: Symptoms, Fatigue/Sleep, Bother-Physical Health, Activity, Psychological Health, and Overall QoL (Figure 1). When subjects were categorized by effectiveness of ITP treatment, statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed for the Symptoms and Activity scales (Figure 1), while statistically significant differences were only found for the Psychological Health scale when subjects were categorized according to time elapsed since ITP diagnosis (data not shown). Subjects who had been diagnosed with ITP for < 1 year had a lower mean score on the Psychological Health scale compared to subjects who had been diagnosed with ITP for at least one year (50.38 vs. 66.46, respectively; p = 0.02) (data not shown).<br><br>
Discussion
The goal of this study was to develop and undertake initial validation analyses of the ITP-PAQ as a tool for measuring HRQoL specifically related to adult subjects with ITP. The results of this study provide preliminary evidence of the reliability and validity of the ITP-PAQ in this population.
The results indicate that, with the exception of the Reproductive Health scale, the questionnaire has good internal consistency. The Reproductive Health scale may not have reached an acceptable level because the items could in fact be measuring slightly different concepts. For example, the Reproductive Health scale includes items that assess symptom bother related to menstruation in addition to items that ask how ITP impacts reproductive choices, such as becoming pregnant, giving birth, and adopting <span class="yellow">children</span>. Perhaps, the symptom bother items in this scale may fit more appropriately with the Bother-Physical Health scale, and the reproductive choice items could comprise a separate scale.
Most of the ITP-PAQ scales also demonstrated acceptable test-retest reliability, even though the time interval between test and retest administrations of the questionnaire exceeded the targeted time interval of seven to ten days. However, two scales, the Bother-Physical Health and Activity scales, reported ICC values below the acceptable value of 0.70. In addition to the lag between the two administrations of the questionnaire, subjects may have experienced an increase in bother and/or a decrease in activity due to ITP during the extended time interval. Additionally, the comparatively low ICC values of the Bother-Physical Health and Activity scales may be due in part to the relatively low number of items contained in each of these scales (four and two items, respectively) compared to the Symptoms scale which contains six items.
In general, the construct validity of the questionnaire was supported by inter-scale correlations. As expected, the Bother-Physical Health, Symptoms, Fatigue/Sleep, and Activity scales were more strongly correlated to one another than with other scales. However, the Reproductive Health scale had a lower internal consistency reliability and it was weakly correlated with the ITP-PAQ scales, the SF-36, and the CES-D, possibly due to the differing concepts measured by the items within this scale or the all-female sample.
Most of the ITP-PAQ scales were moderately correlated with the SF-36 scales and the CES-D; however, correlations between some of the scales were < 0.40 (e.g., Fear and SF-36 Mental Health, 0.30; p < 0.05). This low correlation could be due to the ITP-PAQ assessing fear associated with ITP (e.g., fear of having a bleeding episode), while the SF-36 provides a more general assessment of mental health issues (e.g., felt downhearted and blue).
The known-groups validity results indicate that some of the ITP-PAQ scales (Symptoms, Fatigue/Sleep, Bother-Physical Health, Activity, Psychological Health, and Overall QoL scales) were able to differentiate ITP subjects who were currently receiving ITP treatment from those who were not receiving treatment for ITP, providing preliminary evidence of the ITP-PAQ's ability to distinguish between groups known to be different. However, the ITP-PAQ scales were generally unable to distinguish between subjects when they were grouped by gender, splenectomy status, perceived effectiveness of treatment and length of time since ITP diagnosis. The ITP-PAQ may not be able to differentiate between female and male subjects because the disorder may affect females and males similarly. Additionally, significant differences may not have been observed between subjects who have undergone splenectomy and subjects who have not because 55% of subjects who had a splenectomy indicated that it did not cure their ITP. Specifically, the known-groups could be defined as 'subjects without a splenectomy' versus 'subjects with a failed splenectomy' (for whom QoL likely worsened) versus 'subjects with a successful splenectomy' (for whom QoL may have improved). In the future, to assess whether the ITP-PAQ scales can differentiate between groups of subjects, it may be worthwhile to categorize subjects by a more clinically relevant measure, such as platelet count.
Several limitations should be considered when interpreting our findings. Subjects were drawn from a convenience sample. The study population was fairly homogeneous, comprised primarily of Caucasian female subjects. The data was validated using only <span class="blue">patient</span>-reported data collected via questionnaire. The lack of clinical data in this initial validation study will be addressed in on-going pivotal trials that will collect clinical data such as platelet counts and platelet response. In addition, the time interval between the initial and retest administration of the questionnaire may have been too lengthy to properly evaluate the test-retest reliability. Because 25% of subjects did not complete the questionnaire within the targeted fifteen day interval, those subjects may have undergone clinical changes that may have affected their responses. In future validation studies platelet counts or type of platelet response should be used to identify a stable cohort for the test-retest analyses. Furthermore, the criteria used to categorize the subjects for the known groups validity evaluation may not have been sufficient to allow for the ITP-PAQ scales to detect differences between groups. Grouping the subjects by a different criterion, such as a relevant clinical measure, may bolster the findings for its known groups validity.<br><br>Conclusion
The primary goal of this manuscript was to describe the development of a new ITP-specific HRQoL questionnaire for adults with ITP and to present our initial findings on the psychometric properties of this questionnaire. The results of this initial validation study indicate that the questionnaire generally has acceptable reliability and validity. We plan to conduct additional analyses using more objective clinical measures such as platelet counts as a criterion for known groups validity. Further validation work should also be conducted to assess its responsiveness and to estimate its minimal clinical important difference value so that it can become a more widely used HRQoL measure in the ITP population.<br><br>Competing interests

<h3>pmcA1851709</h3>Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) mRNA copy numbers in immunohistochemically ERα-positive-, and negative breast cancer tissues
Abstract
Background
The presence of ERα is the basis for treating breast cancer <span class="yellow">patients</span> with targeted molecular therapies that block estrogen stimulation of breast cancer cell division. To select <span class="yellow">patients</span> for the above therapies, currently, the ERα presence in breast cancer tissues is determined in clinical laboratories by microscopically scoring the slides subjected to immunohistochemistry (IHC). This method is not quantitative, highly subjective and requires large amount of tumor tissue, therefore, cannot be applied to sterotactic and ultrasound guided biopsy samples. To circumvent these problems, we previously developed quantitative real-time PCR based molecular assay that can be applied to determine mRNA copies of ERα in picogram amounts of total RNA from tumor samples. However, it is not known how the mRNA copy numbers correlate to IHC positive and negative status.<br><br>Methods
In the current study we determined the copy numbers of ERα mRNA by Q RTPCR in breast cancer tissues that were graded as ERα-positive and negative by 1) IHC and 2) functional estrogen binding assay and statistically analyzed the data.<br><br>Results
We demonstrate here that ERα mRNA copy numbers are not significantly different in tissues that are graded as positive by IHC and ligand binding assays. We establish here a cut of value of 5 × 106 copies per 1010 mRNA copies of GAPDH with an Odds Radio of 39.4, Sensitivity of 0.81 and Specificity of 0.90 in breast cancer tissues that are negative for ERα protein by IHC and estrogen binding assays. ROC analysis of the data gave an area of 0.8967 under the curve.<br><br>Conclusion
We expect that the cut off values determined here will be highly significant for applying molecular assay in the place of IHC in clinical laboratories for evaluating the presence of ERα for prognostic and therapeutic purposes.<br><br><br><br>Background
Breast cancer is the most diagnosed and the second leading cause of cancer deaths for <span class="yellow">women</span> in the United States striking about 300,000 and killing about 40,000 <span class="yellow">women</span> a year [1]. A substantial body of epidemiological, experimental and clinical evidence indicated that unopposed stimulation of breast epithelial cells by the natural hormone, estrogen, plays a major role in the progression of breast cancers [2]. Because endogenous estrogens directly promote the growth of breast cancer cells, estrogen deprivation either by inhibiting its biosynthesis (aromatase inhibitors) or blocking estrogen-mediated gene transcription (tamoxifen) through its high affinity receptor, the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), are the primary lines of therapy for breast cancer <span class="yellow">patients</span>. In most cases, the efficacy of the above treatments has correlated with the presence of ERα in the tumor tissues. Currently, only those <span class="yellow">patients</span> who express ERα in their tumors are chosen for aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen therapies. In addition to being a therapeutic target, ERα was also shown to be the most important factor to predict breast cancer prognosis. The <span class="yellow">patients</span> who express ERα in their tumors have an overall longer cancer-free survival and lower recurrence rates than <span class="yellow">patients</span> who do not express this receptor [3].
To predict prognosis and identify <span class="yellow">patients</span> for the above two anti-estrogen therapies, every breast cancer tissue is currently screened for the presence of ERα before a treatment regimen is selected for any breast cancer <span class="blue">patient</span>. The presence of ERα in breast tumors was originally determined in clinical labs by estrogen binding assay for about 20 years. However, when the tumors were detected at comparatively smaller sizes and highly specific monoclonal antibodies were developed that could detect ERα both in the fresh frozen as well as formalin fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, the clinical labs switched to immunohistochemistry (IHC) from estrogen binding assay for determining the presence of ERα. Currently ERα is determined in the clinical laboratories from rough estimates yielded by microscopically scoring the slides subjected to IHC technique using antibodies against the N-terminal A/B region of ERα. Although this procedure is used for over ten years, it has several limitations including not quantitative, highly subjective, variations due to antibody preparations, variations from one clinical lab to other and comparatively large sample size requirement.
In recent times, due to increased awareness and substantially improved screening methods, breast cancers are detected at very early stages and excised, in a large majority of cases, by stereotactic and ultrasound guided techniques. In these cases the limited amount of tumor tissue that remains after histological testing restricts determining ERα status for prognostic and therapeutic purposes by IHC. In many cases, ERα status is not determined due to insufficient amount of tumor tissue. For these reasons there is an urgent need to switch to a procedure that can detect ERα in a very small amount of tumor tissue obtained by the above methods. There is a general consensus that ERα mRNA quantification is a more suited technique for detecting its presence in tumor tissues. Several PCR based approaches have been described for detecting the presence of ERα in breast cancer tissues [4,5]. We recently developed a highly sensitive real-time PCR based quantitative molecular assay that can detect and quantify as low as 50–100 copies of ERα mRNA from as small as 40 picograms of total RNA from breast cancer tissues. Because quantitative real-time PCR is a high through-put method, it could be automated to apply in clinical laboratories. However, it is not known how the ERα mRNA copy numbers correlate to ERα positivity and negativity by IHC assay. Establishing a cut off value in IHC negative tissues is required for the application of molecular assay in the place of IHC assay. To determine the cut off value, we have profiled ERα mRNA copy numbers in breast cancer tissues which have been graded as ERα positive and negative by IHC and estrogen binding assays. We demonstrate here that ERα mRNA copy numbers are not significantly different in tissues that were graded as positive by IHC and ligand binding assays. However, ERα positive tissues, either by IHC or estrogen binding assays, express significantly higher mRNA copy numbers than the negative tissues. We have determined the cut off values of ERα mRNA copy numbers by molecular assay that correlate to ERα negativity by both IHC and ligand binding assays using CART program (Classification And Regression Tree). We expect that the cut off values determined here will be highly significant for applying molecular assay in the place of IHC in clinical laboratories for determining the ERα status for prognostic and therapeutic purposes.<br><br>Methods
All the primers used in the current study were synthesized by Gibco-BRL Life Technologies. TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Cat # 4304437) was from Applied Biosystems. 5'FAM and 3'TAMARA labeled oligonucleotide probes were synthesized by Applied Biosystems and available from previous studies. PCR quality water and Tris-EDTA buffer were from BioWhittaker.
Breast tumor samples
Breast cancer tissues with known ERα status by IHC and ligand binding assay were available from previous studies [6-9]. Briefly, the tumor samples were collected from either biopsy or mastectomies immediately after surgery and stored at -80°C until use. Fresh tumor tissue samples for ERα quantification were routinely harvested immediately adjacent to the histologic/diagnostic sections and considered to be representative of the tissue used for diagnosis. All the samples were examined by a pathologist and tissues containing > 80% cancer cells were excised and used for ERα mRNA quantification. The ERα-status for the samples used in this study was determined either by IHC using monoclonal antibodies against NH2-terminal portion of the molecule at Oncotech Laboratories, Irwine, CA, or by ligand binding assay as described [10]. The tumor tissues were considered positive for ERα by IHC if > 5% of cancer cells showed positive nuclear staining. The tumor tissues that were diagnosed as ERα positive by estrogen binding assay had > 3 fmol of ER/mg of total tissue extract. A total of 70 samples positive by IHC, 33 positive by estrogen binding assay, 43 negative by IHC and 20 negative by estrogen binding assay were included in the current study (Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively). The tumor tissues were processed to isolate total RNA and cDNAs prepared as previously described [6-9]. Howard University Institutional Review Board granted the ethical approval of Tumor collection procedures for the study.<br><br>Absolute quantification of ERα mRNA copy numbers by quantitative real-time PCR
Absolute quantification of ERα transcript copy numbers was achieved by quantitative real-time PCR in ABI Prism GeneAmp 7900 HT Sequence Detection System as described previously (9). Briefly, a typical real-time PCR reaction mixture contained cDNA prepared from reverse transcription of 0.5 – 5 nanograms of tumor tissue total RNA, 0.04 micromolar each of sense and anti-sense primers, 0.05 micromolar 5'FAM and 3'TAMARA labeled oligonucleotide probe and 1 × Taqman Universal PCR Mix in a total volume of 25 μl. PCR conditions were initial hold at 50°C for two minutes, followed by denaturation for ten minutes at 95°C, and denaturation for 15 seconds at 95°C in the subsequent cycles and annealing and extension for 1 min at 60°C for 40 cycles. The ERα mRNA copy numbers in tumor tissues were determined in comparison with a standard graph constructed simultaneously using 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, and 109 copies of reverse transcribed cRNA of ERα. All the samples were amplified in triplicate and real-time PCRs were repeated four times. The ERα mRNA copy numbers in tumor tissues were normalized to mRNA copy numbers of the house keeping gene, glyceraldehyde 3- phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). GAPDH copy numbers were determined as previously described [11,12]. The sense, and anti-sense primers and probe for quantifying the mRNA copy numbers of ERα were 5' caagcccgctcatgatcaa 3' (position, exon 4, bp 1110–1128), 5'ctgatcatggagggtcaaatccac3' (position, exon 5, bp 1358–1338) and FAM 5'agaacagcctggccttgtccctg3'TAMARA (position, exon 4, bp 1140–1162) respectively. The sense and anti-sense primers and probe for quantifying GAPDH mRNA copy numbers were 5'ttccagg agcgag atccct3' (position, bp 304–322), 5'ggctgttgtcatacttctcatgg3' (position, bp 483–505) and FAM 5' tgctggcgctgagtacgtcgtg3' TAMARA (position, bp 342–363) respectively. Primer positions of ERα and GAPDH nucleotide sequences were as described [13,14].<br><br>Statistical analysis
Wilcoxon-rank-sum test and standard two-sample t-test were used to determine whether the mRNA copy numbers were significantly different in breast cancer tissues that were 1) ERα-positive and ERα-negative by IHC, 2) ERα-positive and ERα-negative by estrogen binding assays, 3) ERα positive by IHC and estrogen binding assays, and 4) ERα-negative by IHC and estrogen binding assays. Test results were considered significant if P ≤ 0. 05. To determine the cut-off value/maximum level of mRNA copy numbers in the samples which were negative by IHC and estrogen binding assays, we used CART (Classification Regression Tree) [15,16] program. The data consisting of 103 ERα positive and 63 ERα negative samples which had a predictive variable, mRNA copy numbers, were partitioned into two groups using CART program. This program determines the best cut-off value copy numbers in the sense that the OR (Odds Ratio, ERα positive to ERα negative in our case) of the two groups (with copy number greater than the cut-off value in one group and less or equal to the cut-off value in the other) is maximized. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the RNA based molecular assay. The ROC curves were generated by connecting all the points determined by the copy numbers in all the samples in an increasing order. Since data on IHC grading as percent positive cells were available on some of the samples, the correlation between the IHC grading and the mRNA copy number was determined both in the original scale and in logarithmic transformations scale using S-PLUS software.<br><br>
Results
We have undertaken the current study to determine ERα mRNA copy numbers in breast cancer tissues that were positive and negative by two conventional methods of assaying ERα protein, IHC and estrogen binding. The rational for undertaking this study is that once we establish a threshold value in IHC negative tissues, then the molecular assay could be applied in clinical laboratories in the place of currently used IHC assay for determining the status of ERα for prognostic and therapeutic purposes. Our rational for establishing a cut off value is that any <span class="blue">patient</span> who expresses above the cut off level could be selected as a candidate for anti-estrogen therapies and could be considered to have good prognosis.
We first profiled ERα mRNA copy numbers in 70 samples positive by IHC, 43 negative by IHC, 33 positive by estrogen binding assay and 20 negative by estrogen binding assay. The data are presented in Tables 1, 3, 2 and 4 respectively. A box plot drawn for the copy numbers (logarithm base 2 scale) in the four groups (positive and negative by IHC and by estrogen binding assay) using S-PLUS software is shown in Figure 1.
We next compared the quantitative data on mRNA copy numbers among samples as described below. 1) We tested whether the two conventional assays, the IHC and estrogen binding assays, correlate in terms of mRNA copy numbers in 70 and 33 positive tissues (Tables 1 and 2 respectively) using Wilcoxon-rank-sum test and standard two-sample t-tests. By these two tests, we did not find significant differences in the ERα mRNA copy numbers in samples that were ERα positive by IHC and estrogen binding assays (p > 0.28 by both tests). 2) We also compared the mRNA copy numbers in 43 samples negative by IHC with 20 samples negative by estrogen binding assay and did not find significant differences (Tables 3 and 4 respectively) (p > 0.25 by the above two tests). However, 3) we found significant differences in mRNA copy numbers in the breast tumors that were IHC positive from those which were IHC negative (Tables 1 and 3 respectively) (p = 1.3e-6 by standard two-sample t-test and p = 2.7e-18 by Wilcoxon-rank-sum test). And 4) we also found significant differences in the samples that were positive and negative by estrogen binding assay (Tables 2 and 4 respectively) (p = 7.6e-3 by standard two-sample t-test and p = 3.6e-7 by Wilcoxon-rank-sum test).
After establishing that ERα-positive tissues express significantly higher levels of mRNA copy numbers compared to negative tumor samples, we next determined the maximum level of expression in ERα-negative samples using CART program. By using this program, we found the maximum level of expression of mRNA copy numbers/cut-off value to be 5 × 106 per 1010copies of GAPDH mRNA. Of the total 106 positive (70 by IHC and 33 by estrogen binding assay) samples in our study, 83 samples showed higher level of expression than 5 × 106 copies per 1010 copies of GAPDH. It is possible that the samples that showed less than the above cut off value copy numbers could be due to false positivity by the above methods. In a total of 63 negative samples (43 by IHC and 20 by estrogen binding assay) only 6 samples showed higher expression than 5 × 106 copies per 1010GAPDH copies. It is also possible that the samples that showed higher than the cut off copy numbers could be false negative. The OR (Odds Ratio) in the two groups is about 39.4, an extremely high OR value. The counts of the ERα-positive (80, 23) and ERα-negative (6, 66) in the two groups produce a chi-square value of 88.2544 with 1 degree of freedom, which is consistent with our T-test and Wilcoxon-rank-sum test results.
We applied the above cut off value and determined the Sensitivity (percentage of samples that showed higher copy numbers than the cut off value of 5 × 106 copies per 1010 GAPDH copies in IHC positive tissues) and Specificity (percentage of samples that showed less than 5 × 106 copies per 1010 GAPDH copies in IHC negative tissues) and the values obtained were 0.81 and 0.90 respectively. We also determined Receiver Operating Characteristics using S-PLUS software and the ROC curve generated is shown in Figure 2. The area under the ROC curve, 0.89675, shows that the molecular assay clearly distinguishes the positives by IHC or estrogen binding from the negative tissues.
Since we have the grading score as percent positive cells for about 50 samples (Table 1), we tested if a correlation exits between the percent positive cells by IHC and the mRNA copy numbers using S-PLUS software. We obtained a correlation coefficient of 0.02. When we used the logarithmic transformations scale, we obtained a correlation coefficient of 0.037. These results indicated that there is no correlation between the percent positive cells and the level of ERα mRNA copy numbers. These observations could be due to qualitative nature of IHC assay. The IHC data only show the number of positive cells but not quantitative to determine the level of ERα expression. The molecular assay based on RNA is quantitative to determine the level of ERα expression.<br><br>Discussion and conclusion
Previously ERα mRNA levels in immunohistochemically positive and negative tissues were evaluated in breast cancer tissues by several groups using conventional RT PCR. Cullen et al [17] determined mRNA levels by conventional PCR in 107 breast cancer tissues. They reported that ERα mRNA was more frequently detected in ERα protein positive tissues than ERα protein negative tissues. Jarzabek et al [18] studied ERα mRNA levels and protein levels in 41 primary breast cancer tissues. They reported the presence of ERα mRNA in all the tissues, where as the protein was present only in 70% of tumor tissues by Western blotting and 67% showed positive by immunohistochemistry. They concluded that lack of ERα protein is not due to lack of ERα gene expression or methylation of its promoter, but may be due to post-transcriptional or post-translational mechanisms. Alkarain et al [19] reported the presence of ERα mRNA in immunohistochemically ERα-negative tissues. However, none of the above studies has evaluated the threshold levels of ERα mRNA levels in immunohistochemically negative tissues or those negative by ligand binding assays. Our quantitative analysis of ERα mRNA copy numbers demonstrate that breast cancer tissues that are negative by both IHC and ligand binding express significant levels of ERα mRNA. The reasons why the mRNA is not translated to detectable protein are not clear. Our previous studies on ERβ mRNA copy numbers [9] in breast cancer tissues have shown that at the 5 × 106 copies per 1010 mRNA copies of GAPDH levels ERβ protein is translated. It is possible that either ERα mRNA is not translated or the translated protein is degraded to undetectable levels in these tissues.
The results and the analysis presented above clearly demonstrate that the ERα positive tissues by IHC or estrogen binding assay express significantly higher mRNA copy numbers than 5 × 106 copies per 1010 GAPDH copies. An extremely high Odds Ratio, high sensitivity and specificity demonstrate that the molecular assay could be used in the place of currently used IHC in the clinical laboratories. Based on our data above any <span class="blue">patient</span> who has more than 5 × 106 copies per 1010 GAPDH copies in her tumor tissue could be considered positive for ERα, could be selected for anti-estrogen therapies and considered to have good prognosis. However, the above described approach has some limitations in that it needs to be verified on a defined set of biopsy samples and with reference to another house keeping gene. Therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution and undoubtedly will require confirmation by a larger prospective multi-centered clinical study with a more accurate design to bring the technology to the clinic. The current study is a first step in that direction. We expect that the cost effective, extremely sensitive, high though-put molecular assay which requires only a few cancer cells could be an assay of choice to replace IHC in clinical labs for determining ERα status in breast cancer tissues once established in a multi-centered prospective clinical study.<br><br>Abbreviations

Abstract
Objective
GH1 gene presents a complex map of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the entire promoter, coding and noncoding regions. The aim of the study was to establish the complete map of GH1 gene SNPs in our control normal population and to analyse its association with adult height.<br><br>Design, subjects and measurements
A systematic GH1 gene analysis was designed in a control population of 307 adults of both sexes with height normally distributed within normal range for the same population: −2 standard deviation scores (SDS) to +2 SDS. An analysis was performed on individual and combined genotype associations with adult height.<br><br>Results
Twenty-five SNPs presented a frequency over 1%: 11 in the promoter (P1 to P11), three in the 5′UTR region (P12 to P14), one in exon 1 (P15), three in intron 1 (P16 to P18), two in intron 2 (P19 and P20), two in exon 4 (P21 and P22) and three in intron 4 (P23 to P25). Twenty-nine additional changes with frequencies under 1% were found in 29 subjects. P8, P19, P20 and P25 had not been previously described. P6, P12, P17 and P25 accounted for 6·2% of the variation in adult height (P = 0·0007) in this population with genotypes A/G at P6, G/G at P6 and A/G at P12 decreasing height SDS (−0·063 ± 0·031, −0·693 ± 0·350 and −0·489 ± 0·265, Mean ± SE) and genotypes A/T at P17 and T/G at P25 increasing height SDS (+1·094 ± 0·456 and +1·184 ± 0·432).<br><br>Conclusions
This study established the GH1 gene sequence variation map in a normal adult height control population confirming the high density of SNPs in a relatively small gene. Our study shows that the more frequent SNPs did not significantly contribute to height determination, while only one promoter and two intronic SNPs contributed significantly to it. Studies in larger populations will have to confirm the associations and in vitro functional studies will elucidate the mechanisms involved. Systematic GH1 gene analysis in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with growth delay and suspected GH deficiency/insufficiency will clarify whether different SNP frequencies and/or the presence of different sequence changes may be associated with phenotypes in them.<br><br><br><br>Introduction
<span class="yellow">Human</span> skeletal growth and final height attainment are a result of a multifactorial regulation involving systemic and local hormones, growth and nutritional factors, lifestyle and genetic factors. Heritability estimates1 and genome-wide linkage analysis2 have shown that genetic factors play a major role in determining stature. Among these factors, the GH-IGF-I axis plays an important role during postnatal life, and associations between structural variations in its genes and height are currently under study.3 Although growth hormone (GH) deficiency is a well-known cause of growth retardation, which responds to GH replacement therapy, the diagnosis and physiopathological mechanisms for the so-called ‘idiopathic isolated GH deficiency’ (IIGHD) require further clarification. In addition, GH secretion levels and markers of GH biological activity have been demonstrated to be specific and sensitive only in major deficiency states.4,5 Genetic causes of GH deficiency within the GH1 gene have been established; however, they are rarely recognized and only sought in major GH deficiency states during childhood and in family studies.3 GH1 gene, located at 17q22–24, is a component of the GH gene cluster in which five genes evolving from a common ancestor are 91–99% sequence conserved (paralogues).6 GH1 is more abundantly expressed in pituitary cells, while the other four genes are expressed in placental tissue. Large deletions within the GH1 gene cluster were described first followed by point mutations, the majority of which affect introns 3 or 4, provoke skipping of exon 3 product and exert a dominant effect.3,7,8 More recently, the presence of single nucleotide polymorphic points (SNPs) in the promoter region or in intron 4 of the GH1 gene have been described9–12 and associations with promoter allele activities or with GH secretion efficacy and circulating IGF-I levels in growth-retarded <span class="yellow">patients</span> have also been described.11,12 Other studies have analysed several GH1 gene SNP genotypes as related to the incidence of neoplasia, with a positive association with colorectal neoplasia for intron 4 SNP,13 a negative result for breast carcinoma14,15 or a positive one for breast cancer risk.16,17 In addition, a recent study in a cohort of adults over ages 60 years detected a significant association between genotypes at one SNP in the GH1 gene promoter region and at the intron 4 SNP described by Hasegawa et al.11 with baseline bone density and accelerated bone loss together with an interaction with weight at 1 year.18 Intron 4 SNP described by Hasegawa et al.11 has also been associated, in <span class="yellow">women</span>, with shorter body height and reduced mortality,19 whereas another intron 4 SNP (T1169A) has been associated in both sexes with a favourable metabolic profile.20 A systematic SNP study was conducted by Adkins et al.21 in GH1 promoter, coding and noncoding regions in DNAs from placental tissues, and analysis of associations between genotypes and birth weight revealed an association between an alternate nucleotide at −1 and +3 of translation initiation site and fetal growth restriction. However, no systematic GH1 gene analysis in the entire promoter, coding and noncoding regions has been conducted in adults to establish the map of structural variation and its possible association with height. The relatively short size of the entire gene permits a complete analysis which is, nevertheless, hampered by the need to avoid amplification of any other of the GH cluster genes (paralogues) and the high density of sequence variations.
To obtain normative data for subsequent analysis of GH1 gene contribution to IIGHD in <span class="yellow">children</span>, a systematic GH1 gene structural analysis was designed in a normal adult control population to establish the GH1 gene SNP map in adults from our population with heights within the normal range, determine the genotype frequencies and analyse possible associations between individual and combined SNPs with height.<br><br>Subjects and methods
Subjects
A total of 307 adult subjects of both sexes (164 <span class="yellow">women</span> and 143 <span class="yellow">men</span>) were recruited from hospital personnel and parents of <span class="yellow">patients</span> with no history of growth retardation. Subjects had to fulfil the following criteria: Iberian Peninsular (except Basque) family origin and no family history of pathological short stature. A single subject per family was included. The protocol was approved by the Hospital Vall d’Hebron Ethics Committee and written informed consent was obtained from each <span class="yellow">participant</span>. Height standard deviation scores (height SDS) were calculated according to sex-specific reference growth charts for the Spanish population (Carrascosa et al.22 charts were used for subjects under ages 30 years and Hernández et al.23 for subjects aged 30–50 years). Only individuals with height SDS between −2 and +2 SDS were included in the study (mean −0·016; 32 <span class="yellow">women</span> and 28 <span class="yellow">men</span> between −2·000 and −1·010; 99 <span class="yellow">women</span> and 80 <span class="yellow">men</span> between −1·000 and +0·910; 33 <span class="yellow">women</span> and 35 <span class="yellow">men</span> between +1·010 and +1·980) and sample size was adjusted for normal sex and height SDS distribution. Height and weight were recorded in the morning by a single observer. Height was measured with a Harpenden stadiometer. Four millilitres of peripheral venous blood were drawn into EDTA-containing tubes for molecular genetic analysis.<br><br>Genomic DNA study
Genomic DNA was obtained from peripheral blood following the method described by Lahiri and Nurnberger.24 DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a nested strategy. Briefly, 50 ng of genomic DNA were added to a 10 µl reaction mixture of 1 mm Mg(OAc)2, 0·6 mm dNTPs, 0·3 µm of each primer, and 0·4 U r Tth DNA polymerase XL (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The sense and antisense primers used corresponded to nucleotides 4156–5′ACGGTCCGCCACTACGCCCAGC-3′ and the complement of 6948–5′TGCAGTGAGCCAAGATTGTGCC-3′ of the GH gene cluster.6 The PCR reaction mix was denatured for 5 min at 94 °C and cycled 40 times (94 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 3 min 30 s) followed by a 7-min extension at 72 °C. The resulting GH1 PCR products (2893 bp) were used as templates for five nested reactions (AN, BL, CK, DI, FP), carried out as follows: 1 µl of each GH1 PCR product was added to a 20 µl reaction mixture of 1·5 mm MgCl2, 0·2 mm dNTPs, 0·3 µm of each primer and 0·4 U Eco Taq DNA polymerase (Ecogen S.R.L., Barcelona, Spain). Reaction mixtures were denatured for 5 min at 94 °C, cycled 40 times (94 °C, 1 min; 58 °C, 1 min; and 72 °C, 1 min), followed by a 7-min extension at 72 °C. Sense and antisense primers were as follows:
Sequencing from both ends was performed by the dideoxy method using ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator version 3·1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). GH1 gene nucleotide sequence published by Chen et al.6 was used as control. For each DNA, the five segments from the nested PCR were assembled with the SeqEscape programme (Applied Biosystems) and interpretation was made visually and simultaneously by two observers. Antisense sequencing was performed to confirm each nucleotide sequence change up to the establishment of the more frequent SNP map (frequency over 1%), whereas less frequent single or multiple nucleotide changes were reconfirmed in each DNA by antisense sequence and resequencing after a new nested PCR from original DNA was performed.<br><br>Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping
The sequences for the five genes of the GH cluster identified by Chen et al.6 and reported as the GI sequence 183148 were aligned using the Multalin program.25 SNPs and other sequence changes identified were indicated using their position corresponding to GH1. Genotypes were deduced by the combination of genetic variation at the polymorphic positions.<br><br>Statistical analysis
Standardized height was investigated for normal distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: c2 = 2·882, P = 0·4733). Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was tested for SNPs presenting three alternate genotypes according to standard procedures using χ2-analysis. anova test was applied to investigate individual and combined SNP association with adult height SDS; significance assessment was adjusted for multiple testing using Fisher's PLSD test setting Pcritical = 0·05 or the Bonferroni–Dunn test setting Pcritical = 0·05/n (n = number of comparisons carried out). Stepwise regression analysis was applied to predict the contribution of SNPs to adult height SDS. Statview 4·5 program (Abacus Concepts Inc., Berkeley, CA, USA) was used for statistical analyses.<br><br>
Results
GH1 gene sequence variation
GH1 gene sequence comparison with the GI-183148 sequence published by Chen et al.6 yielded a total of 54 single or multiple nucleotide changes. Twenty-five SNPs presented a frequency over 1% (genotypes and frequencies are listed in Table 1). SNPs which presented the three alternate genotypes (P2 to P4, P6, P7, P10 and P24) were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (data not shown). Twenty-nine additional changes were found with a frequency under 1% or involving more than one nucleotide and thus could be considered as rare variant SNPs (R1 to R29) (Table 2). These changes were found in 29 of 307 subjects (9·4%), all in heterozygosity.<br><br>GH1-paralogue alignment
A sequence alignment was performed to study possible sequence recombinations among paralogues of the five GH1-gene cluster (Fig. 1). This alignment showed that 9 of 25 SNPs (36%) in the GH1 gene did not correspond to any of the paralogues.
Among the 29 rare SNPs found, six (20·7%) did not correspond to any of the paralogues: two were located in the 5′UTR region (R9 and R10), two in intron 1 (positions 5300 = R14 and 5302 = R17), one in intron 2 (position 5679 = R21) and one in intron 4 (position 6344 = R23) (Table 2).<br><br>Equivalence with previously reported GH1 changes
Equivalence with changes and SNPs previously reported by other authors are shown in Table 3. The majority found a high density of SNPs in the promoter and 5′UTR regions in control populations.10,12,21 Several sequence changes have been reported in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with familial or idiopathic short stature,11,26,27 whereas P8, P19, P20 and P25 (at positions 5165, 5681, 5686 and 6358, respectively, in the Genebank accession GI 183148) located in the promoter, intron 2 and intron 4 regions, respectively, had not been previously described.<br><br>GH1 genotypes and associations with height SDS
Associations between genotypes and standardized height were first studied in the subpopulation of 278 controls carrying only the 25 most frequent SNPs in the GH1 gene (c2 = 2·59; P = 0·5458 for normality of height distribution).
Three individual SNPs showed a statistically significant association with height SDS: at positions 5286 (P16), 5290 (P17) and 6358 (P25). Subjects with heterozygous genotypes presented statistically significant taller stature than the corresponding homozygous genotypes (P = 0·016 for P16, P = 0·015 for P17 and P = 0·023 for P25) (Fig. 2a,b,c). P16 and P17 were in linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r2 = 0·831), while P25 was carried by six subjects homozygous at P16 and P17.
GH1 gene genotypes were defined by genetic variation in the 25 polymorphic positions. We found 163 different combinations. Only two genotypes presented a frequency over 5% (Table 4). Height SDS in the two more frequent genotypes did not differ significantly and covered the whole height range. Genotype 1 presented four heterozygous variations and Genotype 2 was the corresponding homozygous genotype. Heterozygous positions corresponded to SNPs with the highest frequency variation (4886 (P4), 5107 (P7), 5157 (P10) and 6331 (P24)). In addition, DNAs exhibited a different genotype in each of 129 subjects (46·4%).
The 11 SNPs found in the promoter region (Table 1) were grouped in 94 genotypes and analysed for association with adult height SDS. The four more frequent combinations are listed in Table 4: height SDS of these four genotypes did not differ statistically although Genotype 3 tended to have a shorter height. Genotype 3 differed from Genotype 1 in the SNP located at position 5089 (P6), corresponding to Pit 1 proximal responsive element for GH1 gene promoter. Genotype 4 is heterozygous at positions 4856 (P2), 4863 (P3) and 5107 (P7). In addition, 19% of cases exhibited a genotype in the promoter region carried by only one subject.
Combination of the three SNPs in the 5′UTR region of GH1 gene resulted in five different genotypes. SNPs at positions 5178 (P12) and 5187 (P13) were in LD (r2 = 0·88). Mean height SDS comparison among these genotypes was not statistically significant, although mean height SDS of alternate nucleotide carriers at position 5178 (P12) tended to be shorter (Table 4).
An anova analysis was conducted to investigate the interaction between two or more SNPs and height SDS. SNPs at positions 5286 (P16) and 5290 (P17) were in LD (r2 = 0·83): the heterozygous genotype AG/AT for these SNPs was associated with taller stature (shown above). SNP at position 6358 (P25) increased the expected height SDS for individual carriers of the G allele at 5089 (P6) SNP as shown in Fig. 2(d): subjects heterozygous at 6358 (P25) were taller than the mean, and mean height SDS of subjects with GG/TG combined genotype was significantly higher than the corresponding GG/TT genotype (P = 0·0021), suggesting an interaction between these two SNPs as they were not in LD.
Analysis of height SDS association with the most frequent single and combined SNPs and with rare variant SNPs was performed in the 29 individuals carrying the rare SNPs (Table 2). None of them carried any of the three SNPs (P16, P17 and P25) related to taller stature in the population of 278 controls with only the frequent SNPs. In these 29, mean height SDS (0·000 ± 0·987, from −1·930 to +1·870) did not differ from that of the 278 controls (−0·018 ± 1·041, from −2·000 to +1·980). Analysis of associations between individual SNP genotypes and height SDS revealed that SNPs at positions 5089 (P6), 5178 (P12) and 5187 (P13) were associated with significantly shorter stature (Fig. 2e). Only two sequence changes considered as rare SNPs were carried by individuals in the lower normal height range (between −1·500 and −2·000 SDS) (Table 2): R4 (4979 C > T) in the promoter region and R14 (5300 C > T) in intron 1. Predicted single amino acid changes located in exon 5 (R25 to R27) were not associated with short stature.
In the entire population of 307 controls, stepwise regression analysis between height SDS and genotypes at the 25 SNPs showed that genotypes at 5089 (P6), 5178 (P12), 5290 (P17) and 6358 (P25) were significantly correlated with height SDS (r2 = 0·062, P = 0·0007) with genotypes A/G at P6, G/G at P6 and A/G at P12 decreasing height SDS (−0·063 ± 0·031, −0·693 ± 0·350 and −0·489 ± 0·265, respectively, Mean ± SE) and genotypes A/T at P17 and T/G at P25 increasing height SDS (+ 1·094 ± 0·456 and +1·184 ± 0·432, respectively).<br><br>
Discussion
Genetic variations within <span class="yellow">human</span> GH1 gene have been described by several authors.9–12,21 The populations described to date comprised small numbers of normal-stature individuals,9 male adults with narrow height range12 or growth-retarded <span class="yellow">patients</span> with/without GHD before achievement of adult height.9,11,12 Our study was designed to characterize the GH1 gene sequence variation in individuals within the whole range of normal adult height (between −2 and +2 SDS) according to the standards for our population. Height was normally distributed, both sexes were equally represented and the GI-183148 homozygous sequence6 was used for comparison. A nested PCR with specific primers for GH1 gene was designed, thus avoiding amplification of any other GH gene paralogue of the GH gene cluster.
Our results establish a map of 25 SNPs as present in over 1% of individuals, whereas 29 other sequence changes (single or multiple nucleotide) are present in less than 1% of subjects. More than 50% (n = 14) of SNPs are located in the promoter and 5′UTR regions, thus confirming previous reports: Giordano et al.9 reported eight SNPs in the promoter and 5′UTR regions, Wagner et al.10 16 SNPs from the promoter to intron 1 and Horan et al.12 identified 36 haplotypes in control subjects of the British population, which would result from the combination of 15 of the previously reported SNPs. Our results confirm the presence of 13 of those points; SNP at 5165 (R11 in the present study and +3 in references9,12) was present in less than 1% of subjects and a new SNP is described (P8 at 5116 in the VDR/RA/T3 responsive element sequence). The remaining SNPs (from P15 to P25, n = 11) are distributed in introns 1, 2 and 4, and among coding regions only exon 1 and exon 4 bear a total of three SNPs, two of which predict an amino acid change (P15 and P21). These two latter SNPs had been described by Millar et al.26 and the more frequent SNP in intron 4 (P24) has been described by Hasegawa et al.11 together with the two more frequent SNPs in the promoter region (P4 and P7 in our map). Three new SNPs are described (P19 and P20 in intron 2 and P25 in intron 4), all outside the splice sites. Only SNPs presenting high frequency are present in homozygous alternate state and this accounts mostly for the majority of the promoter and 5′UTR SNPs and in the intron 4 more frequent SNP (P24) described by Hasegawa et al.11 In conclusion, in the entire coding and noncoding GH1 gene sequence, only P24 is present in homozygous alternate state. Our results show that the GI 183148 homozygous sequence is present in our population except for SNP P14 in the 5′UTR region which is only present as the alternate nucleotide in homozygous or heterozygous states.
As described by several authors9,10,12,21 several promoter SNPs affected functional sequences and P6 is located in the Pit 1 proximal responsive element, P7 and P8 in the VDR/RA/T3 responsive element and P9 (G del) in the TATA box.
The mechanisms by which the high density of SNPs in the GH1 gene is generated has been proposed to be recombination and gene conversion with any other(s) of the GH cluster genes.9,12,28 Alignment of the 25 SNPs with the other GH1 gene paralogues demonstrated in our results that this mechanism is possible for 64% of SNPs. Familial SNP transmission pattern analysis will be of interest to support the hypothesis of GH gene recombination.
In addition, 29 of 307 individuals (9·4%) bore additional GH1 sequence changes with frequencies under 1%. As for SNPs, they are located along the whole gene with higher density in the promoter and 5′UTR regions. Interestingly, intron 3 and exon 5 present several of these less frequent changes. Intron 3 has been shown to carry the majority of single nucleotide mutations causing the dominant form of GH deficiency.3 The two single nucleotide changes detected in intron 3 (R15 at 6056 and R16 at 6061) are in perfect LD (r2 = 1·0) and located within the enhancer splice site element (ESE) described by Ryther et al.29,30 Studies in additional normal or growth-retarded populations will permit description of their possible clinical implications. Five single nucleotide changes are located in exon 5; of these five, three predict an amino acid change, and one of the three (Ile179Met) has been described by Lewis et al.27 in a paediatric <span class="blue">patient</span> with familial short stature and the other two, as yet undescribed, are contiguous in a single individual (Pro133Hys and Arg134Leu). Polynucleotide changes are mostly located in the promoter region corresponding to the VDR/RA/T3 response element. As for frequent SNPs, the majority of the sequence changes with frequencies under 1% may have been generated by recombination within the GH gene cluster as 19 of 24 (79%) may correspond to one or more of the GH1 gene paralogues.
Our results now show the diversity and complexity of SNP genotypes, as previously highlighted by other authors9,10,12,21 in a normal adult height control population. Our initial aim when designing the present study was to establish the map of GH1 gene SNPs in our adult control population with heights normally distributed within the entire normal range for further comparison with genotypes in our paediatric population with growth delay, variable response to GH secretion tests and adequate response to GH therapy. Analysis of SNP association with adult height was subsequently performed to establish a body of knowledge useful for comparing <span class="blue">patient</span> genotypes and phenotypes. This analysis was first performed in controls bearing only frequent SNPs (90·5% of the total population). We demonstrate that the four SNPs with the highest allelic variation frequencies (P4, P7, P10 and P24) do not significantly contribute to adult height determination, with the heterozygous genotype being the most frequent followed by the corresponding homozygous genotype in the whole sequence, and heights are normally distributed over the entire height range. The third most frequent combined genotype in the promoter region in our population presented, in addition, in heterozygosity, the SNP at P6 in the sequence regulated by Pit 1 and although mean height of individuals (6·1%) bearing this genotype was around −0·5 SDS, this was not statistically significant.
Analysis of single SNP genotype association with adult height yielded few clues as to the contribution of GH1 gene variation to adult height determination. Only three SNPs (P16, P17 and P25), present with low frequency and only in heterozygous state, were individually significantly associated with taller stature and none was individually associated with shorter stature. P16 and P17 (in LD, r2 = 0·83) are located in intron 1 and P25 in intron 4. The resulting sequence for the presence of P16 and P17 corresponded to the paralogue GH2 and generated a responsive element for a core-binding protein (Matinspector Programme, Geometrix Software GmbH, München, Germany) with three Kruppel-type zinc fingers which could increase the efficacy of GH1 gene transcription;31,32 moreover, Kruppel-like proteins have recently been described in the brain.33 Stepwise regression analysis demonstrated that P17 and P25 contribute, separately, to an increase of almost 1·0 height SDS. P16 and P17 had been described by Adkins et al.21 although they found no association with fetal growth, whereas P25 had not previously been described. The mechanisms by which they may determine taller final height should be established by in vitro studies analysing GH1 gene transcription and GH protein translation efficiencies.
Analysis of interaction effect between SNPs detected that variation at P25 masked an effect of P6. Individuals homozygous at P25 (TT) present a significant association between P6 genotype and height with the homozygous alternate genotype at P6 (GG) being associated with shorter stature. This was further confirmed in the subpopulation of 29 individuals bearing rare SNPs who, in the absence of heterozygous change at P25, presented significantly shorter stature in the heterozygous alternate nucleotide change at P6 (AG). P6, located at Pit 1 proximal responsive element of the GH1 gene promoter, was first described by Wagner et al.10 and Giordano et al.9 and further by Horan et al.12 Six of nine GH1 gene promoter haplotypes bearing the alternate G at P6 presented lower transcriptional activities and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) detected differential protein binding strength, although in vitro studies were unable to identify this SNP as a major determinant of GH1 gene expression level.12 A recent study from Giordano et al.34 has shown a twofold reduced luciferase activity for the G nucleotide bearing promoter haplotype in transfected <span class="yellow">rat</span> pituitary cells. Genotypes at P6 had also been associated with decreased breast cancer risk through its association with lower GH secretion and IGF-I circulating levels.16,17
In our results, GH1 gene polymorphic structural variation accounted for only 6·2% of adult height determination in the entire adult population studied and genome-wide linkage analysis of stature in multiple populations revealed no linkage with chromosome 17 GH gene cluster.2,35 As only some of the less frequent SNPs are statistically associated with height, and in view of the high density of SNPs, our study may be hampered by selection bias36 and would ideally have required a wider sampling of some 2 000 individuals; however, this was a highly laborious strategy when the complete sequencing technique is applied. The high density of SNPs and their proximity hamper other genotyping strategies for rapid determination of the complete GH1 SNP map in large control and <span class="blue">patient</span> populations. Individual SNP associations with height or other GH secretion-related phenotypic traits will require further confirmation by studies in larger populations and by in vitro functional studies.
In conclusion, our study established the GH1 gene sequence variation map in an adult control population with heights normally distributed within the normal range. SNPs and other sequence change contributions to skeletal growth as observed at adult height demonstrated that, despite the high frequency of variation and diversity and complexity of combinations, only some of the less frequent SNPs were associated with taller stature (P17 in intron 1 and P25 in intron 4), even masking the SNP contribution to a shorter one (P6 in the promoter and P12 in the 5′UTR regions, respectively). Systematic GH1 gene analysis in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with growth delay and suspected GH deficiency/insufficiency will clarify whether different SNP frequencies and/or the presence of different sequence changes may be associated with phenotypes in them.<br><br>
<h3>pmcA2367482</h3>Modeling the effect of PTPN22 in rheumatoid arthritis
Abstract
In order to model the effect of PTPN22 on rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we determined the combination of single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNPs) showing the strongest association with RA. Three SNPs (rs2476601-rs12730735-rs11102685) were selected for which we estimated the genotypic relative risks (GRRs) of the corresponding genotypes. On the basis of these GRRs we defined four at-risk genotypic classes. Relative to the class of reference risk, individuals had a risk approximately multiplied by two, three, or four. This classification was confirmed by the excess of identity-by-descent (IBD) sharing (IBD = 2) for the sibs of an index in the high-risk class and by excess of non-IBD sharing (IBD = 0) when the index belonged to the low-risk class. The observed data could not be explained by the role of a single variant but were compatible either with a joint effect of the three typed SNPs of PTPN22 on RA or with the role of two untyped variants.<br><br>Background
The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) R620W, also denoted rs2476601, is located within the hematopoietic-specific protein tyrosine phosphatase gene, PTPN22. This SNP (C/T) codes for an amino-acid change and the frequency of its minor allele T has been recently and repeatedly shown to be increased in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [1]. The allele T confers 1.7- to 1.9-fold increased risk to heterozygote and higher risks to homozygote carriers [2] compared to the non-carrier individuals. This variant is also well known to be associated with several other autoimmune diseases [3], such as systemic lupus erythematosus and type 1 diabetes. Recently, Carlton et al. [2] studied the PTPN22 genetic variations in the North American Rheumatoid Arthritis Consortium (NARAC) data. Using the information on several SNPs typed in PTPN22, they compared the haplotype distributions in NARAC <span class="yellow">patients</span> and controls. They demonstrated that SNP R620W does not fully explain the association between PTPN22 and RA and suggested the effect of at least one additional variant in the PTPN22 gene.
We propose here to reanalyze the NARAC data using both association and linkage information for modeling the role of PTPN22 in RA.<br><br>Methods
Data
We selected from the NARAC data the 511 families with affected sib pairs typed for 14 SNPs of PTPN22, and 1404 unrelated controls also typed for all these SNPs. For each affected sib pair we considered the proband as an index RA <span class="blue">patient</span>. The R620W SNP is one of the 14 SNPs in PTPN22. It is located at the ninth position, so it will be subsequently denoted as SNP 9. A preliminary study of linkage disequilibrium (LD) among the 14 SNPs was examined in the 1404 controls. The LD analysis lead us to exclude 3 SNPs (SNP 2, SNP 12, SNP 13), which are in complete LD with one (or more) other SNP(s).<br><br>Selection of associated SNPs
The combination test [4] was used on the 11 remaining SNPs to select the subset of SNPs showing a significant difference in the genotypic distribution between RA index <span class="yellow">patients</span> and controls. Its principle consists in testing all possible combinations of SNPs within a gene. Here, there are (211-1) possible combinations. Such a systematic testing of all SNPs and all SNP combinations raises the problem of multiple and non-independent tests. This problem is generally solved by the implementation of a permutation procedure that allows estimation of corrected p-values. Here, associated combinations are very significant and the number of permutations necessary to discriminate them would be extremely high and almost unreachable. Nevertheless, the chi-square values of the genotypic association test are so high that even the conservative Bonferroni correction can be used. We selected the most associated and parsimonious subset of SNPs by nested chi-square tests (NCST) in a forward procedure. The NCST compares the strength of association between nested significant subsets.<br><br>Genotypic relative-risk estimation
For the selected subset of SNPs, we used the marker association segregation chi-square (MASC) method [5] to compute the genotypic relative risk (GRR) of each genotype. The genotype distributions of index and controls was conditional on the fact that the index has an affected sib.<br><br>Stratified sib pair IBD estimation
Conditional on each marker genotype of the index cases, the number of parental alleles identical by descent (IBD) shared by the index case and one affected sib were estimated on PTPN22 with the MERLIN software [6]. MERLIN is able to take into account LD between SNPs during the IBD computation. So the estimated IBD distributions are computed on the overall set of SNPs even if they are in LD. The fit of a model to the IBD distributions stratified on index marker genotypes [7] may then be tested by the MASC method.<br><br>Modeling PTPN22 effect
We applied the MASC method [5] to find the most parsimonious model explaining the overall observations, i.e., the genotype and the stratified sib-pair IBD distributions. To do this, MASC requires the haplotype frequencies in the general population, which were estimated on the unrelated controls by the MERLIN software.
The MASC method computes the expected genotype marker distribution and the expected sib-pair IBD distributions stratified on marker genotypes for a given genetic model. Here, the computation of the genotypic distribution is conditioned on the fact that index cases have an affected sib. The global expected likelihood of the genetic model given the observed data is then computed as the product of the likelihoods of each expected distribution, and is maximized on the model parameters. The fit of the model to the observed data is tested by a likelihood ratio test (LRT) between global expected likelihood and the likelihood of the saturated model.<br><br>
Results
Selection of associated SNPs
Many subsets of SNPs show significant associations. Table 1 presents a selection of the most associated combinations of one, two, and three SNPs. When considering only the effect of a single SNP, the only significant associated one after correction for multiple testing is SNP 9. The combination of SNPs 9–10 is the one which, among the combination of two SNPs, best improves the association shown by the SNP 9 alone (p = 0.017). The subset SNPs 9-10-11 (rs2476601-rs12730735-rs11102685) is the only one that improves significantly the association shown by the SNPs 9–10 (p = 0.038). Adding another SNP to this subset does not significantly improve the association. Consequently, all the subsequent analyses have been done considering SNPs 9-10-11 and their ten corresponding genotypes.<br><br>GRR estimation
Table 2 displays the genotypes and the corresponding GRRs for SNP 9 taken alone (columns 1 and 2) and for the set of the three SNPs 9-10-11 (columns 3 and 4). The GRRs vary from 1 to 2.7 when considering only SNP 9, whereas the variation ranges from 1 to 4.7 when the information on the three SNPs is taken into account. Interestingly, the CC genotype of the SNP 9 can be subdivided in several genotypes when taking into account the genotypes for SNPs 10 and 11 (rows 1 to 6) with GRRs ranging from 1 (CC-GG-AA) to 3.6 (CC-AA-GG). This observation demonstrates the importance of using the additional information on SNPs 10–11.<br><br>Sib pair IBD estimation
The proportion of RA sibs sharing 0, 1, or 2 parental alleles for PTPN22 is 0.26 (181 pairs), 0.51 (362 pairs), and 0.23 (167 pairs), respectively, and does not differ from the IBD distribution 0.25; 0.5; 0.25 expected under no linkage. However, if our GRRs correctly reflect the differential risk of RA, we expect to see differences in the IBD vectors stratified on the genotypes of the subset of SNPs 9-10-11 [7]. To avoid cells with small numbers of individuals we pooled sib pairs with the index genotypes (SNP 9-10-11) that have similar risk. We thus defined four arbitrary at risk genotypic classes: the low risk class (L; GRR = 1; 19 pairs), the intermediate risk class 1 (I1; 1 < GRR ≤ 2; 295 pairs), the intermediate risk class 2 (I2; 2 < GRR ≤ 3; 157 pairs), and the high risk class (H; GRR > 3; 34 pairs).
Table 3 shows that the proportion of IBD = 0 decreases from 0.47 to 0.09 according to the fact that the index belongs to class L or class H and conversely, the proportion of IBD = 2 increases from 0.11 to 0.26. These stratified IBD distributions are consistent with the risk genotypic classes. In contrast, the IBD sharing distributions stratified only on SNP 9 genotypes are not consistent with the GRR estimates on this SNP (Table 4).<br><br>Modeling PTPN22 effect
We apply the MASC method in using the genotype distribution only on the SNP 9 and the IBD stratified on the SNP 9 genotypes. In that case, the single and causal effect of the SNP 9 is not rejected (p = 0.29). Then, we model the effect of PTPN22 using the four genotypic groups of risk defined on the genotypes of the combination of the SNPs 9-10-11 and the IBD information stratified on them. In this case, we reject the direct effect of SNP 9 (p = 0.005). We also reject the effect of a single untyped SNP (p = 0.04). However, we do not reject the interactive effect of the 3 SNPs (p = 0.53) or the interactive effect of two untyped SNPs.<br><br>
Discussion
The involvement of PTPN22 and HLA in RA susceptibility is no longer disputed. However, as shown by Carlton et al. and confirmed in this study, the role of PTPN22 cannot be explained only by the R620W SNP.
A correct modeling of PTPN22 is important and shows that the genotypic risk varies much more (1 to 4.7) than reported in the literature (1 to 2.7) [4]. In this study we proposed, for the first time, a model for the effect of PTPN22, taking into account both association and linkage information.
Another method, called LAMP [8] was recently proposed for joint modeling of linkage and association [8]. The linkage information used by the LAMP method is the global IBD sharing of affected sib pairs. However, it is very important to note that the power of model discrimination strongly depends on the association and linkage information that is used. As shown here, the information on SNP 9 alone and on the global IBD is very poor as compared with that of the three SNPs 9-10-11 and to the stratified IBD distributions on the four at-risk genotype groups.
In conclusion, we applied a four-step strategy to model the effect of a candidate gene covered by several SNPs: 1) to select the most associated set of SNPs; 2) to group the corresponding genotypes according their GRRs; 3) to stratify IBD sharing information on the at-risk genotype groups; 4) to model the effect of the candidate gene while taking into account both linkage and association information.
This strategy allowed better modeling of the effect of PTPN22 in RA susceptibility. Recently, du Montcel et al. [9] refined the modeling of HLA in RA susceptibility. A next step will be to use simultaneously the PTPN22 and HLA information to evaluate their joint effects while taking into account important covariables such as age and gender.<br><br>Competing interests

<h3>pmcA2526157</h3>Identification and Analysis of Co-Occurrence Networks with NetCutter
Abstract
Background
Co-occurrence analysis is a technique often applied in text mining, comparative genomics, and promoter analysis. The methodologies and statistical models used to evaluate the significance of association between co-occurring entities are quite diverse, however.<br><br>Methodology/Principal Findings
We present a general framework for co-occurrence analysis based on a bipartite graph representation of the data, a novel co-occurrence statistic, and software performing co-occurrence analysis as well as generation and analysis of co-occurrence networks. We show that the overall stringency of co-occurrence analysis depends critically on the choice of the null-model used to evaluate the significance of co-occurrence and find that random sampling from a complete permutation set of the bipartite graph permits co-occurrence analysis with optimal stringency. We show that the Poisson-binomial distribution is the most natural co-occurrence probability distribution when vertex degrees of the bipartite graph are variable, which is usually the case. Calculation of Poisson-binomial P-values is difficult, however. Therefore, we propose a fast bi-binomial approximation for calculation of P-values and show that this statistic is superior to other measures of association such as the Jaccard coefficient and the uncertainty coefficient. Furthermore, co-occurrence analysis of more than two entities can be performed using the same statistical model, which leads to increased signal-to-noise ratios, robustness towards noise, and the identification of implicit relationships between co-occurring entities. Using NetCutter, we identify a novel protein biosynthesis related set of genes that are frequently coordinately deregulated in <span class="yellow">human</span> cancer related gene expression studies. NetCutter is available at http://bio.ifom-ieo-campus.it/NetCutter/).<br><br>Conclusion
Our approach can be applied to any set of categorical data where co-occurrence analysis might reveal functional relationships such as clinical parameters associated with cancer subtypes or SNPs associated with disease phenotypes. The stringency of our approach is expected to offer an advantage in a variety of applications.<br><br><br><br>Introduction
Biological research has experienced a paradigm shift in the last decade catalyzed by the availability of genome sequences and the resulting development of high-throughput technologies. The large data volumes produced by these novel technologies are often published as supplementary material and/or stored in extensive data repositories [1]. Functional interpretation of these data is an ongoing challenge. Co-occurrence analysis, based on the hypothesis that co-occurring entities are functionally linked, is a technique that has been used in three main areas of biological research:
Co-occurrence of genes in sequenced genomes relies on the fact that proteins do not function in isolation and are dependent on other proteins, either as direct binding partners, or as catalysts of substrates. Thus, when two proteins significantly co-occur in a large number of genomes or can be observed as fusion proteins in a subset of genomes, they are likely to be binding partners or enzymes needed for a specific metabolic pathway. Examples of those studies have been reported by [2]–[7].
Text mining is a quickly evolving field that aims at developing technologies helping to cope with the functional interpretation of large volumes of publications. Co-occurrence of gene names in publication abstracts, entire publications, or other gene-related databases has been used to derive co-occurrence networks with clear evidence that edges in those networks are reflecting functionally relevant relationships [8]–[11]. Gene names have also been analyzed for co-occurrence with other entities such as mutations [12], chemical compounds [13], and disease related keywords [14]. From the resulting networks, hypotheses about candidate genes involved in inherited diseases and drug targets can be derived. Clustering of gene related publications using keywords has been applied to enhance the quality of gene expression clusters [15], [16]. More general (non gene-centric) approaches try to organize the literature into functional areas based on co-occurrence of MeSH terms, keywords, diseases, phenotypes, chemicals, and similar objects of biomedical research interest [17]–[21].
Co-occurrence analysis of transcription factor binding motifs has been carried out in a variety of slightly differing ways in a wide range of organisms, including <span class="yellow">humans</span>. [22]–[33]. The underlying hypothesis is that co-regulated genes, identified usually by gene expression studies, should contain specific combinations of transcription factor binding motifs in their upstream regulatory regions, the identification of which would allow the reverse-engineering of transcription regulatory networks [34].
We have recently applied co-occurrence analysis to studying published gene expression signatures and showed that co-occurrence patterns of genes reflect cancer signaling pathways [35]. Although co-occurrence analysis has a respectable history, the methodologies used in the studies mentioned above could not be easily applied to studying gene expression signatures. There are three main reasons that dictated the use of a different approach. First, gene expression signatures can vary in size by orders of magnitude. Obviously, the larger a signature the more likely it is to find two or more genes co-occurring in that signature. Thus, the significance of co-occurrences must be evaluated in the presence of considerable heterogeneity of co-occurrence probabilities among gene lists. As a consequence, the statistics used to evaluate the significance of co-occurrence events must reflect this heterogeneity. In particular, it must be based on list-specific co-occurrence probabilities. Second, in the vast majority of previous studies, co-occurrence is analyzed for pair-wise combinations of co-occurring entities. We found that the resulting stringency of this approach is not adequate for the analysis of published gene expression signatures [35]. Third, the null-model against which the significance of co-occurrences is tested does not work well for gene expression signatures. A common procedure is to use generic randomization of the entire data set under analysis or to select subsets of data entries randomly for comparison purposes. However, gene expression signatures are composed of distinct gene sets and the null-model must maintain this property, which is not guaranteed using these approaches. Furthermore, the list-specific nature of co-occurrence probabilities cannot be dealt with properly.
NetCutter was developed to address these challenges and to provide a generic tool for generating and analyzing co-occurrence networks. Although NetCutter has been developed for the analysis of gene expression signatures, it is based on abstract concepts that make it applicable to a wide variety of problems. The input is represented by a bipartite graph that is composed of list-entry pairs, which are stored in tab-separated text format. Co-occurrence of entries in lists is analyzed using pair-wise or higher order combinations of entries. The significance of co-occurrence is tested using a novel bi-binomial approximation of Poisson-binomial statistics (which is a binomial distribution with trial specific probabilities) that handles list-length-heterogeneity properly and provides a novel measure of association that is found to be superior to the Jaccard and the uncertainty coefficients. Occurrence probabilities are obtained from an edge-swapping procedure that maintains vertex degrees in the underlying bipartite graph and distinct sets of entries per list. As we shall see below, this procedure has a number of advantages over other possible null-models and permits co-occurrence analysis with near maximum stringency. Last but not least, NetCutter is equipped with a number of algorithms for the identification of network communities, vertex ranking, and convenience tools needed in the analysis of co-occurrence networks, or any undirected graph. We illustrate the utility of NetCutter in the identification of corresponding clusters of genes and publications from the PubLiME data set. PubLiME (Published Lists of Microarray Experiments) is a repository of published cancer related gene expression signatures (http://bio.ifom-ieo-campus.it/Publime). The concept of cluster correspondence follows from the bipartite graph representation of the data. Reversing the list-entry order in the bipartite graph permits identifying communities of entries as well as communities of lists. We show that communities of publications corresponding to communities of genes in the PubLiME data set can be used to generate hypotheses about the putative function of gene communities.<br><br>Results
The bipartite graph model of co-occurrence analysis
Co-occurrence analysis using NetCutter is based on the abstraction of list-entry pairs. Any entity that co-occurs with some other entity must be confined to some sort of container where co-occurrence is observed. For example, in the case of gene name co-occurrence in PubMed abstracts, the abstract is the container and the gene names are the co-occurring entities. Similarly, co-occurrence of transcription factor binding motifs is observed in gene promoters. The promoters are the containers where motif entities co-occur. The containers generally host more than one entity (otherwise co-occurrence would be impossible) and can be conveniently interpreted as lists. The co-occurring entities are the list entries. Lists and entries form a bipartite graph with one part of the graph representing lists and the other part representing entries. The presence of a given entry in a given list is indicated by an edge between the corresponding list and entry vertices. It is required that each entry can be linked to the same list only once. Without loss of generality, let's consider genes as entries and PubMedID_listIDs as lists in the following, unless otherwise specified (Fig. 1A). This interpretation of lists and entries has been applied in the co-occurrence analysis of published gene expression signatures [35].<br><br>Occurrence probabilities and null-models
A prerequisite for co-occurrence analysis is the availability of occurrence probabilities of genes per list. The occurrence probabilities can be derived from randomizing the bipartite graph and are dependent on the choice of the null-model. A null-model creates an occurrence probability matrix where the occurrence probability for each list–gene pair is listed. As a general property of this matrix, the sum of all matrix elements must equal the number of edges in the bipartite graph. This is because each edge is linked to either side of the bipartite graph with certainty and therefore the sum of occurrence probabilities over all lists (which can be calculated as the row sum if genes are listed vertically or as the column sum if genes are listed horizontally) followed by summing the results over all genes must be 1 for every edge. The number of matrix elements is given by #genes*#lists and therefore the average occurrence probability for any null-model must be #edges/(#genes*#lists). As a consequence, different null-models will only be distinguished by the way they attribute occurrence probabilities to vertices with different vertex degrees but not by the average occurrence probability.
We consider six different strategies to randomize the bipartite graph. First, we could reconnect all edges of the graph randomly. The probability of being connected by an edge for a given list-gene pair is given by (1/#genes)*(1/#lists). Since there are #edges edges to be reconnected, the occurrence probability for a single list-gene pair is #edges/(#genes*#lists), i.e. equal to the average occurrence probability. Thus, this model provides equal occurrence probabilities for all gene-list pairs and does not consider vertex degrees. We call this model the generic randomization (GR) model in the following.
Second, we could disconnect the edges on only the list side of the bipartite graph and reconnect them randomly. The occurrence probability of a gene vertex would be given by (gene vertex degree)/#lists. The sum of these probabilities over all lists is equal to the gene vertex degree and the sum of all gene vertex degrees is equal to the total number of edges. Thus, the sum of all matrix elements is equal to the number of edges, as required. Since this model considers gene vertex degrees, we call it the gene vertex degree (GVD) model.
Third, we disconnect the edges on the gene side of the bipartite graph and reconnect them randomly. The probability of a list vertex being connected to a gene would be given by (list vertex degree)/#genes. The sum of these probabilities over all genes is equal to the list vertex degree and the sum of all list vertex degrees is equal to the total number of edges. Again, the sum of all matrix elements is equal to the total number of edges. Since this model considers list vertex degrees, we call it the list vertex degree (LVD) model.
In model four and five, we reconnect edges considering both gene and list vertex degrees and allow multiple edges between list-gene pairs. The occurrence probabilities in model four are calculated according to the binomial distribution. We calculate the probability of a list-gene pair for being connected as the cumulative binomial probability of the list-gene pair being chosen at least once in the process of randomly reconnecting the edges. This can be achieved by setting the number of trials equal to the gene vertex degree, the probability of success equal to the list vertex degree divided by the total number of edges, and the number of successes equal to 0. The occurrence probability of a list-gene pair is then given by the complement of this probability. This model is called the binomial (BN) model. In model five, we calculate occurrence probabilities according to the hypergeometric distribution. The number of successes in the sample is equal to 0, the sample size is equal to the gene vertex degree, the number of successes in the population is set to the list vertex degree, and the population size is the total number of edges. Again, the occurrence probability of a list-gene pair is obtained as the complement of this probability. We call this model the hypergeometric (HG) model. Calculating occurrence probabilities in this manner does not guarantee that the matrix elements add up to the total number of edges. Therefore, the matrices are normalized such that this condition is satisfied by multiplying each matrix element with the factor #edges/(observed matrix sum), which is generally quite close to 1, however.
In model six, we again consider vertex degrees, but we require that each list is composed of distinct sets of genes. Thus, multiple edges are forbidden. This condition is satisfied by applying an edge-swapping procedure during graph randomization. Edge-swapping works by randomly choosing two list-gene pairs from the bipartite graph and prior to performing the edge-swap, a test is performed to ensure that the two genes are not already linked to the respective target lists. This procedure is performed a large number of times. To ensure complete randomization of the graph, the number of swaps performed should be significantly larger than the number of edges. After performing R randomizations of the graph and counting the number of times a gene has been linked to a particular list, division of this number by R gives the occurrence probability of a gene in a given list. As will be shown below, edge-swapping produces occurrence probabilities that closely approximate occurrence probabilities obtained by generating a complete permutation set of the bipartite graph, counting the number of times a gene is found part of a list, and dividing this number by the total number of permutations. In the permutation model, the sum of occurrence probabilities of a gene over all lists equals the gene vertex degree (see below) and thus the sum of all matrix elements is the number of edges. Since permutation sets of bipartite graphs are difficult to calculate, we use the edge-swapping procedure as a close approximation and call this model the edge-swapping (ES) model.
Fig. 1 shows the occurrence probabilities of the different null-models for the bipartite graph shown in Fig. 1A. The GR model yields identical occurrence probabilities for all list-gene pairs, which is equal to the average occurrence probability in all models. In the other models, the occurrence probabilities deviate to varying extent from the average occurrence probability as a function of vertex degrees. In the GVD model, the deviations are a function of gene vertex degree and in the LVD model the deviations are dependent on list vertex degrees. In the remaining models, the deviations are functions of both the gene and the list vertex degrees. In all cases, larger than average occurrence probabilities are obtained for larger vertex degrees at the expense of smaller than average occurrence probabilities for smaller vertex degrees. From these data, it is difficult to choose the most effective null-model. A hint can be gleaned from gene1, however. Gene1 is present in all lists. Therefore, the co-occurrence probability of gene1 with other genes, which is calculated by multiplying the occurrence probabilities of gene1 and geneX for every list under study, should depend only on the occurrence probability of this other gene. In other words, the occurrence probability of gene1 in all lists should be 1.0. Only two models satisfy this constraint: The GVD and the ES models. Since the GVD model does not consider list vertex degrees, it seems that the ES model is the preferred null-model.<br><br>Expected number of co-occurrences
As a general criterion for comparing the effectiveness of different null-models, we have to compare them for the number of expected co-occurrences. The most effective null-model will be the one that maximizes the expected number of co-occurrences. If the expected number of co-occurrences is larger, an observed number of co-occurrences in a real bipartite graph will be less significant and thus such a null-model permits co-occurrence analysis with higher stringency. The expected number of co-occurrences depends in an obvious fashion on the list vertex degree. If pair-wise co-occurrences are considered, the number of co-occurrences in a list of vertex degree N is given by the binomial coefficient N over 2. Larger lists will give rise to more co-occurrences and the number increases quickly with list vertex degree. The dependency of the expected number of co-occurrences on the gene vertex degree is less obvious and depends strongly on the null-model. A gene that is part of a list with vertex degree N will give rise to N-1 co-occurrences in that list. The null-model permits calculating the probability to find this gene in a given list. Thus, the expected number of co-occurrences of a gene is given by the sum of expected co-occurrences in all lists where for a single list the expected co-occurrences are given by (Nl−1)*pl. Nl is the list vertex degree and pl is the occurrence probability of the gene in that list as determined by the null-model.
We used the PubLiME data set [35] to calculate the expected number of co-occurrences with different null-models. The results are shown in Fig 2A. The expected number of co-occurrences was calculated for all genes in all lists using all null-models and the sum of expected co-occurrences per gene is shown as a scatter plot with the gene vertex degree on the x-axis and the expected number of co-occurrences on the y-axis. The results in Fig. 2A suggest the following ranking of null-models: GR<GVD<LVD<BN = HG<ES. The BN and the HG models perform in an essentially identical way. However, the ES model is the model that yields the largest estimates of expected co-occurrences. The results are also in line with the intuitive expectation that genes with higher vertex degree give rise to more co-occurrences. However, it can be seen that this is not true for all null-models. In particular, it is not true for the GR and the LVD models, which do not consider gene vertex degrees.
As outlined above, it is expected that the null-model that yields the highest estimates of expected co-occurrences should permit co-occurrence analysis with the highest stringency. In Fig. 2B, this hypothesis is tested directly again using the PubLiME data set [35]. For all null-models, co-occurrence analysis was carried out using module size 3 and support 5 (co-occurrence modules must be present in at least five publications). The choice of these parameters has been discussed in [35]. The number of co-occurrence modules was then determined that have a Z-score higher or equal than the cut-off shown in Fig. 2B. The Z-score is calculated from the mean and variance of the Poisson-binomial distribution as shown in the Materials and Methods section and published in [35]. More details on the probability distribution will be provided below. The GR and GVD models perform very poorly and identify large numbers of modules with high Z-scores. The LVD model performs a little better and approximates the BN and HG models at higher Z-score cut-offs. The BN and HG models give essentially identical results. However, the ES model is the model that yields the fewest number of significant co-occurrence modules and is thus the most stringent. The increased stringency of the ES model over the BN and HG models is also reflected in a higher signal-to-noise ratio calculated as the number of significant co-occurrence modules in the real bipartite graph divided by the number of modules found in a randomized bipartite graph (Fig. 2C).
The reason for the superior stringency of the ES model over all other models can be explained by examining the average occurrence probability per gene and list vertex degree. Fig. 2D and E show the average occurrence probability of genes with the same gene vertex degree as a function of the gene vertex degree. It can be seen that the ES model yields higher occurrence probability estimates for genes with higher vertex degrees as compared to the BN and HG models. In GR and LVD models, gene vertex degrees are ignored and occurrence probabilities for genes with large vertex degree are very small, which is compensated by larger occurrence probabilities for genes with small vertex degree. The GVD model is identical to the ES model in this setting. Fig. 2E shows the average occurrence probability of all lists with the same vertex degree as a function of list vertex degree. It can be seen that the ES model provides higher occurrence probability estimates for large lists as compared to the BN and HG models. In this setting, the LVD model performs like the ES model while the GR and GVD models yield small occurrence probabilities for large lists. Since it has been shown above that long lists and genes with high vertex degree are responsible for a large part of the total number of co-occurrences for the most stringent null-models, the null-model that provides larger occurrence probability estimates for genes and lists with high vertex degree at the expense of lower estimates for smaller degrees will be the most stringent because large occurrence probabilities make co-occurrence more likely and thus less significant. By these criteria, the ES model is the most stringent of all models tested.<br><br>The ES model as an approximation of the permutation null-model
The data shown above have revealed that the ES model is the best of the models tested. One may wonder, however, whether yet more effective null-models can be found. An obvious choice would be the permutation model. In the permutation model, a complete permutation set of the bipartite graph is created such that each list is composed of distinct sets of genes. The number of graphs where a gene is present in a given list divided by the total number of permutations then provides the occurrence probability estimate. The permutation model is the ideal null-model because it is exhaustive. The problem is that a complete permutation set of bipartite graphs of some complexity is very time consuming to calculate. For example, the simple bipartite graph from Fig. 1A is part of a permutation set of 455 graphs. The number of permutations is increasing quickly as the numbers of genes and lists grow. However, since edge-swapping ensures that gene lists are composed of distinct sets of genes, each edge-swap produces a graph that is part of the permutation set of the bipartite graph. Edge-swapping can thus be viewed as a random sampling procedure from the permutation set of the bipartite graph. Therefore, occurrence probability estimates derived by edge-swapping should approximate those obtained from the permutation model.
We generated a complete permutation set of the graph shown in Fig. 1A to verify this hypothesis. The results are shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3A shows how the number of possible permutations can be calculated. Gene1 is present in all lists and does not have an impact on the total number of permutations. Gene2, having vertex degree two, is present in two out of three lists in one out of three possible ways. The remaining genes have vertex degree 1 and can be freely chosen to fill the empty slots. We can now count exactly how many times a gene is linked to a list and divide these counts by 455, the size of the permutation set, to obtain exact occurrence probabilities. These numbers are shown in graphical form in Fig. 3B and in numerical form in Fig. 3C. Fig. 3B also shows the occurrence probability estimates obtained by edge-swapping side-by-side to the exact occurrence probabilities. The graph in Fig. 1A was subjected to edge-swapping 1000 times and the number of times a gene was found present in a list was divided by 1000 to obtain the occurrence probability. At each run, 100 random edge swaps were performed to ensure complete randomization of the graph. This procedure was repeated 10 times and the mean and standard deviation of occurrence probability estimates for each gene in each list are shown. In all cases, the mean differs from the real probability by less than two standard deviations, in most cases by less than one standard deviation. Thus, edge-swapping provides reliable estimates of exact occurrence probabilities as determined from a complete permutation set.
As an interesting observation, we provide evidence that occurrence probabilities are non-linear functions of vertex degrees in the edge-swapping model. This is illustrated in Fig. 3C. Individual and average occurrence probabilities are shown as a function of gene and list vertex degrees. Non-linearity of individual occurrence probabilities can be verified from the counts table underneath the plots. However, the average occurrence probability is found to depend on vertex degrees in a linear fashion instead. This is a consequence of the fact that occurrence probabilities of a gene over all lists add up to the gene vertex degree and that the occurrence probabilities of all genes for a given list add up to the list vertex degree. At the same time, since the most stringent permutation based null-model predicts non-linear dependencies of individual occurrence probabilities on vertex degrees, assuming such linearity in statistical models of co-occurrence will be linked to loss of stringency.
We conclude that the ES null-model is the null-model that permits co-occurrence analysis with the highest stringency among the models tested and that it closely approximates occurrence probabilities derived from an ideal permutation model. The increased stringency of the ES model over other models is a consequence of higher occurrence probabilities for genes and list with high vertex degrees, which are giving rise to a large part of all co-occurrences in the bipartite graph. Since large occurrence probabilities make co-occurrence more likely, the analysis becomes more stringent.<br><br>Co-occurrence probabilities
Co-occurrence analysis can be thought of as a Bernoulli experiment with a binomial outcome (a given combination of entries is either present or not present in a given list). Thus, the Binomial distribution (BD) is a natural choice for judging the significance of the number of co-occurrences. However, the BD is defined for a probability of success which is equal in all trials. The list-specific nature of occurrence probabilities is not compatible with this condition (analysis of each list represents one trial), which means that co-occurrence analysis in the presence of list-length-heterogeneity is better described as a series of Poisson trials, where the probability of success varies from trial to trial. Therefore, the significance of co-occurrences must be evaluated using a binomial distribution with trial-specific probabilities, i.e. the Poisson-binomial distribution (PBD). The probability of success in a single Poisson trial can be calculated by multiplying the list-specific occurrence probabilities for the combination of genes under study. The number of occurrence probabilities that need to be multiplied is equal to the module size, i.e. the number of genes whose combination is studied. An observed number of co-occurrences for a combination of genes can then be evaluated using the PBD, which is given by the formula [36]:(18)
The structure of this formula is very similar to the structure of the formula used to calculate the binomial distribution, except that multiplication with a binomial coefficient is replaced by summation over individual terms, which makes calculation of P-values using (18) inefficient (note that equation numbering starts in the Materials and Methods section). Here, Ak denotes the kth set of indices of the i lists where genes are co-occurring (“success”). There are  possible sets and summation is carried out accordingly.  denotes the set of indices of N−i lists where genes are not co-occurring (“failure”). [36] have reported two fast procedures for calculating exact PBD P-values. However, both procedures work with probability ratios and suffer from numerical overflow/underflow problems for large numbers of trials. NetCutter uses two workarounds to circumvent this problem. One is based on using Poisson-binomial Z-scores, which can be calculated very easily instead (see below). The other relies on a fast approximation procedure for calculating Poisson-binomial P-values, which we call bi-binomial approximation (BBA) or bi-binomial distribution (BBD).<br><br>Z-scores and P-values of BBD
Given the mean μ (1) and variance σ2 (2) of PBD (see Materials and Methods), the Z-score associated with a given number of co-occurrences x is obtained as:(19)
Considering the structure of formulae (1) and (2) (Materials and Methods section), PBD Z-scores can be calculated very easily and provide a simple estimate of the significance of co-occurrence modules. However, in contrast to normally distributed Z-scores, binomial and Poisson-binomial Z-scores do not correspond to the same P-value for different sets of probabilities of success. To see this, calculate for example the probability of success in a series of 100 Bernoulli trials with success probability 0.1 and 0.9 for the expectation of 10 and 90 successes, respectively. The Z-score will be 0 in both cases but the corresponding cumulative P-values are 0.5832 and 0.5487. Therefore, exact levels of significance cannot be derived from Z-scores alone. Thus, a fast and reliable procedure for calculating Poisson-binomial P-values is needed. The BBD approximation was developed to solve this problem.
The BBD approximation of PBD P-values follows from the relationship between the variance of PBD and the population variance of trial-specific probabilities of success. This relationship is shown in Materials and Methods to be described by (4):(4)
This equation shows that there is an inverse linear relationship between the population variance S2 of the N trial probabilities and the variance of PBD σ2, which means that PBD becomes increasingly narrow as the variance of trial probabilities grows. It also shows that, for constant mean μ and number of trials N, the shape of PBD depends only on the variance of trial probabilities. Therefore, relationship (4) suggests an easy way to approximate PBD P-values. The P-value can be obtained by constructing a set of trial probabilities with equal variance as the original set of trial probabilities, which, however, are not all different. In other words, the series of Poisson trials can be replaced by two sets of Bernoulli trials with trial probabilities p1 and p2 constructed such that the variance is equal to the original set of trial probabilities. This strategy is illustrated in Fig. 4 and explains why this approximation is called bi-binomial. The details on how to obtain the values of the two sets of Bernoulli trial probabilities and the number of trials with p1 and p2 as probabilities of success are provided in the Materials and Methods section. The precision of the BBD approximation is discussed in supplementary material Simulation S1.
In order to evaluate whether BBD P-values as a significance measure of co-occurrence offer an advantage over other measures such as the Jaccard coefficient or the uncertainty coefficient, pair-wise co-occurrence of two genes in 200 lists with and without list-length-heterogeneity was studied (Fig. 5). Each gene is assumed to occur in 100 lists. Therefore, the occurrence probabilities of both genes over all 200 lists must add up to 100, regardless of list-length-heterogeneity. For simplicity, occurrence probabilities of both genes are assumed to be equal in any particular list. The co-occurrence probability in a list is then given by the square of the occurrence probability in that list. For all possible co-occurrences from 0 to 100, the Jaccard and uncertainty coefficients were calculated as detailed in the Materials and Methods section. In addition, cumulative BBD P-values were calculated using the co-occurrence probabilities as trial probabilities. To illustrate the advantage of BBD over BD as co-occurrence probability distribution, cumulative BD P-values of a BD with the same mean as BBD but constant trial probabilities is shown. These trial probabilities can be obtained by dividing the mean of BBD by the number of lists.
Three different cases of list-length-heterogeneity are considered in Fig. 5: No heterogeneity (standard deviation 0), heterogeneity with standard deviation 0.283 and heterogeneity with standard deviation 0.401 in the occurrence probabilities. The Jaccard and uncertainty coefficients are by definition insensitive to list-length-heterogeneity because differences in co-occurrence probabilities in a given list cannot be considered in their calculation. This is because both coefficients are defined by the counts of the four list classes: both genes absent, both genes present, first gene absent second gene present, and first gene present second gene absent, i.e. by the corresponding contingency table, which does not change with different list-length-heterogeneity. In the absence of list-length-heterogeneity, the cumulative P-values of BD and BBD (which are perfectly overlapping as expected) assume 0.5 at 50 co-occurrences, which corresponds to the expected number of co-occurrences calculated as (50 = 100 occurrences per gene/200 lists) ˆ2*200 lists. The uncertainty coefficient is found to be 0 and the Jaccard coefficient is 0.33333 at that point. When there is modest list-length-heterogeneity (standard deviation 0.283), the mean of BBD is shifting to the right. This is because the sum of squares of varying occurrence probabilities (i.e. the sum of co-occurrence probabilities used as trial probabilities, which is equal to the mean of BBD) is always larger than the sum of squares of constant occurrence probabilities with the same average occurrence probability (0.5). The corresponding BD in the presence of list-length-heterogeneity is obtained by dividing the expected number of co-occurrences by the total number of lists, which means assuming equal co-occurrences in all lists. This visualization is shown to illustrate how BBD (which is narrower than the corresponding BD) gives rise to a steeper cumulative distribution of P-values and as a consequence to more significant P-values for numbers of co-occurrence that are far from the expectation. As the level of list-length-heterogeneity grows (standard deviation of occurrence probabilities 0.401), the mean of BBD is shifted even further to the right and BBD P-values are distributed in a still steeper fashion as compared to corresponding BD P-values and the interval of non-significant co-occurrences is shrinking further. With modest list-length-heterogeneity, the expected number of co-occurrences is 66, which is associated with a Jaccard coefficient of 0.49 and an uncertainty coefficient of 0.075. In the case of large list-length-heterogeneity, the expected number of co-occurrences is 82 with J = 0.69 and UC = 0.32.
Taken together, these data show that the expected number of co-occurrences varies strongly with the level of list-length-heterogeneity and that the expected number of co-occurrences is associated with different values of UC and J. To complicate matters further, 66 co-occurrences (J = 0.49, UC = 0.075) represent significant positive association (PBBD = 0.996) with equal list lengths, no significant association with modest differences in list length (PBBD = 0.536) and strongly negative association (meaning one gene excludes the other) with strong list-length-heterogeneity (PBBD = 0.00016). Thus, the same J and UC association measure is obtained for positive, negative, and absence of association. Therefore, the meaning of these measures cannot be interpreted properly in the absence of knowledge about the occurrence probabilities of the co-occurring entities. Furthermore, the data in Fig. 5 also show that neither J nor UC can distinguish between positive and negative association while this is easy with cumulative BBD P-values: Large P-values mean positive association and low P-values mean negative association. In summary, we conclude that BBD provides a novel association measure that offers a number of advantages over the existing contingency table based association measures Jaccard coefficient and uncertainty coefficient. The results in Fig. 5 also show that significance of association depends critically on the specific distribution of co-occurring entities over lists of varying length (because this distribution determines the occurrence probabilities) and that contingency table based methods (which cannot capture this distribution) should be avoided in the presence of significant list-length-heterogeneity.<br><br>Generation of co-occurrence networks and the identification of communities
The procedures outlined above allow the identification of significant co-occurrence modules in any type of bipartite graph. Three user defined parameters have an impact on the stringency of co-occurrence analysis: The module size, the support, and the Z-score/P-value cutoff. The module size determines how many entries will be tested for co-occurrence, the support sets a lower boundary on the required number of co-occurrences, and the Z-score/P-value cutoff sets the significance threshold. In general, higher module size leads to more stringent co-occurrence analysis at the cost of computational complexity. The support parameter allows limiting this complexity by filtering out co-occurrence modules which co-occur less frequently than required by the support. The significance cutoff permits adjusting the signal-to-noise ratio, which is calculated as the number of co-occurrence modules observed in the real versus a randomized bipartite graph. The impact of these parameters on the stringency of co-occurrence analysis has been reported previously for the PubLiME data set [35] and is illustrated in a simulation study provided as supplementary material Simulation S1. From the set of significant co-occurrence modules, a co-occurrence network is generated by considering each entry a vertex and drawing an edge between any two vertices, which have been part of the same significant co-occurrence module [35].
An important question in the analysis of co-occurrence networks regards the presence of network communities. Communities can be understood as groups of vertices with the property that the number of edges running within groups is larger than expected by chance and that the number of edges running between groups is lower than expected by chance [37]. This problem of partitioning a graph is often referred to as the graph-cut problem (hence the name NetCutter). NetCutter is built on the Java Universal Network and Graph framework (JUNG) software package (http://jung.sourceforge.net), which provides algorithms for solving this problem. In particular, NetCutter implements the Bicomponent clustering algorithm [38], the Edge-Betweenness clustering algorithm [39], and the Exact Flow Community algorithm [40]. Furthermore, there is a clustering tool that is not part of the JUNG package, namely an algorithm identifying communities using eigenvectors of the modularity matrix [37]. The code for this algorithm was kindly provided by Mark Newman in C++ and ported to Java. In addition to these tools, NetCutter provides a number of convenience functions for the analysis of co-occurrence networks, such as testing the significance of lists reporting a set of entries making up a network community, ranking of vertices, random graph generators for topological analysis of co-occurrence networks, and others. Details on all functions are provided in the NetCutter software documentation.
One of the possible applications of NetCutter is illustrated below. This application is tightly linked to the bipartite graph representation of the data. Namely, NetCutter can be used to perform co-occurrence analysis of genes or list derived from the same bipartite graph. The network communities identified in each both reflect the same underlying structure of the bipartite graph. In the case of gene expression signatures stored in PubLiME, clusters of genes correspond to clusters of publications, which can reveal possible functions of gene clusters.<br><br>Cluster correspondence and association studies
The co-occurrence analysis of the PubLiME data set published previously [35] identified 5 major network communities of genes with consistent functional annotations that are deregulated in cancer related gene expression signatures. This analysis was performed by considering all genes mentioned in a particular publication as a single signature, even though they might have been part of different tables and cluster analyses. Here we present an advanced analysis of the PubLiME data set where each table and/or cluster identified in a given publication is considered as a separate signature. This brings the total number of signatures to be analyzed to 1015 comprising a total of 7358 differentially regulated genes derived from 233 publications reporting cancer related signatures derived from <span class="yellow">human</span> samples. We use this analysis to illustrate three major points: First, the set of communities reported previously is reproduced by this more fine-grained analysis. Second, the set of gene communities corresponds to a set of publication communities. Third, associations between publications and gene communities can be calculated with higher stringency using the edge-swapping null-model in conjunction with bi-binomial P-values as compared to binomial or hypergeometric statistics.
The bipartite graph to be analyzed is composed of PubMedID_listID-gene pairs (see supplementary material Table S1). Co-occurrence analysis was carried out in two ways: First, gene co-occurrence was analyzed and communities of co-occurring genes were defined by edge-betweenness clustering as described in Materials and Methods. Second, co-occurrence of PubMedID_listIDs was analyzed. To this end, the order of PubMedID_listID-gene pairs was reversed to form GENE-PUBMEDID_LISTID pairs. Thus, the lists in the resulting bipartite graph are formed by genes and the entries are the PubMedID_listIDs where the genes are reported as differentially regulated. Occurrence probabilities for the reversed bipartite graph can be obtained by transposing the occurrence probability matrix of the original bipartite graph. Since the gene communities identified in gene co-occurrence analysis reflect the structure inherent in the bipartite graph (which is not affected by reversing the list-entry order), co-occurrence analysis of the reversed bipartite graph will result in PubMedID_listID communities that reflect the same underlying structure in the bipartite graph. In other words, PubMedID_listID communities correspond to gene communities. In less abstract terms, the PubMedID_listID communities should correspond to sets of publications that report similar sets of genes as differentially regulated. The identification of communities of publications can help the researcher to easily identify publications studying genes in a gene community that is of interest to the researcher.
The results of both types of co-occurrence analysis are displayed in Fig. 6. Fig. 6A shows the gene clusters identified. The clusters are named after significant enrichments of gene categories as determined by functional category enrichment using DAVID [41]. The P-values shown are Benjamini corrected for multiple testing as reported by DAVID. The clusters are very similar to the clusters published previously [35]. There is one new cluster that is strongly enriched for ribosomal proteins (“protein biosynthesis” cluster), which has not reached significance in our previous analysis. The “surface antigen” cluster contains many genes that had been reported as part of the “signal transduction” cluster. Altogether, however, these results strongly support the notion that the gene clusters in the PubLiME data set can be reproduced by the more fine-grained analysis that considers sublists in each publication as separate signatures.
The corresponding clusters of PubMedID_listIDs are shown in Fig. 6B. There are five clusters, which have been named after their corresponding gene cluster. Only one cluster (the “extracellular matrix-immune response cluster”) cannot be separated by edge-betweenness clustering at the point of maximal graph modularity. To see that this naming is indeed justified, we needed to investigate how strongly a given PubMedID_listID is associated with a given gene cluster, i.e. how significant is the overlap of the genes reported in a gene cluster and the genes reported in a PubMedID_listID. Binomial or hypergemetric statistics are generally used to calculate this significance. However, the bipartite graph model in conjunction with the edge-swapping null-model offers a more fine-grained approach based on bi-binomial statistics.
The edge-swapping null-model determines occurrence probabilities in such a way that the number of genes in a given PubMedID_listID is associated with insignificant P-values in the context of the complete bipartite graph. However, when a subset of genes is analyzed, e.g. all the genes that are reported in a particular list, the P-value associated with the number of genes contained in this list will likely be highly significant according to how unlikely it is to obtain all the genes contained in a given list in a random draw from all genes present in the bipartite graph. Thus, PubMedID_listID association with a set of genes in the bipartite graph model can be calculated in the following way: The set of genes that is used to analyze association is used to extract a subgraph from the original bipartite graph where occurrence probabilities for each gene-PubMedID_listID pair are identical to those in the original bipartite graph (i.e. they are not recalculated by edge-swapping). The vertex degree of the PubMedID_listID vertices in the subgraph indicates the number of genes contained in each PubMedID_listID overlapping with the set of genes used to extract the subgraph. From the occurrence probabilities of the genes in a given PubMedID_listID, the bi-binomial P-value can then be calculated for every list vertex degree observed in the subgraph. In Fig. 7, the significance of association of the PubMedID_listIDs (see Fig. 6B) with the cell cycle cluster of genes (Fig. 6A) is calculated. For comparison, binomial and hypergeometric P-values are also shown. It can be seen that the bi-binomial P-value is larger than the binomial and hypergeometric P-values, which means that the strength of association is evaluated in a more stringent manner using BBD statistics (see Discussion for an explanation of this observation).
The analysis of significant associations between PubMedID_listIDs and gene clusters now permit answering the question whether there is correspondence between gene clusters and PubMedID_listID clusters. The naming of PubMedID_listID clusters shown in Fig. 6B is based on the number of PubMedID_listID that are significantly associated with gene clusters shown in Fig. 6A. First, for each gene cluster, all the PubMedID_listIDs that are associated with that cluster with more than 95% confidence (i.e. cumulative bi-binomial P-values> = 0.95) were identified. Second, the number of significant PubMedID_listIDs in each PubMedID_listID cluster was counted for every gene cluster. The significance of this number was then calculated using binomial statistics. The results of this analysis are shown in Table 1. Negative decadic logarithms of the binomial P-value are displayed. It is apparent that each PubMedID_listID cluster is strongly associated with at least one gene cluster, except for the “extracellular matrix-immune response” cluster, which is associated with two gene clusters. The strength of these associations suggests that the PubMedID_listID clusters are indeed corresponding to the gene clusters and that both the gene and the PubMedID_listID clusters reflect the structure of the bipartite graph representing the PubLiME data set.
Details about all the lists analyzed are attached as supplementary material Table S2. Looking at these lists, some general conclusions about the gene clusters can be drawn. Cell cycle cluster genes have been found deregulated in a wide variety of tumor types such as colon cancer, breast cancer, in biliary tract cancer, pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, prostate cancer, T-cell leukemia, glioma, acute lymphoblastic and myeloblastic leukemias, soft tissue sarcoma, neuroblastoma, as well as in a number of cellular model systems in response to different stimuli. Thus, the cell cycle cluster seems to consist of genes with a general role in oncogenesis. The surface antigen cluster instead seems to be derived preferentially from studies on leukemia. The interferon cluster genes are found deregulated in virus induced pathologies such as papilloma virus induced cervical cancer, and viral hepatitis. Immune response cluster genes were reported as differentially regulated in inflammatory conditions such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and <span class="yellow">Helicobacter pylori</span> infections. Genes of the extracellular matrix cluster seem to be associated with cancer progression studies and metastatic potential. For the protein biosynthesis cluster, there are 15 signatures that are significantly enriched for those genes. The cancers studied comprise medulloblastoma, glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, lung carcinoma, breast carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, multiple myeloma, and lymphocytic leukemia. The genes are also found deregulated in response to DNA damage. Although the number of signatures is limited, the variation in conditions where the genes are deregulated is compatible with the hypothesis that protein biosynthesis genes, as cell cycle genes, are deregulated in many cancer types, which might reflect the general property of cancer cells to divide and grow in an uncontrolled fashion.<br><br>
Discussion
Here we have investigated basic aspects of co-occurrence analysis and present a software tool, NetCutter, which can be used to identify and analyze generic co-occurrence networks. In NetCutter, a co-occurrence data set is represented as a bipartite graph with one part representing lists and the other part list entries whose co-occurrence patterns are studied. The bipartite graph representation of co-occurrence data sets allows the efficacy of different null-models to be tested systematically. We have shown that an edge-swapping procedure used to randomize the bipartite graph generates a null-model that allows co-occurrence analysis with the highest stringency. The other null-models tested here tend to underestimate occurrence probabilities of entries per list for lists and genes with high vertex degrees, i.e. for lists and genes where most co-occurrences are observed. As a result, co-occurrences are judged more significant than they really are.
Co-occurrence data sets with exactly equal lists lengths are likely to be the exception from the rule. It can be assumed that some list-length-heterogeneity will be present in most circumstances. An important consequence of list-length-heterogeneity regards the co-occurrence probability distribution used to evaluate the significance of the observed number of co-occurrences. Co-occurrence analysis in the presence of list-length-heterogeneity is best performed using the Poisson-binomial distribution (a binomial distribution with trial specific probabilities). However, calculating Poisson-binomial P-values for large numbers of lists is difficult using existing procedures [36]. We have presented an approximation to the Poisson-binomial distribution, called bi-binomial distribution, which is based on replacing the set of Poisson trials by two sets of Bernoulli trials. The resulting distribution reproduces the Poisson-binomial distribution nearly exactly and its P-values can be calculated with ease even for thousands of lists (see also supplementary material Simulation S1 for details on the precision of BBD). Importantly, BBD provides a novel measure of association, which is shown to be superior to existing measures such as the Jaccard coefficient and the uncertainty coefficient, whose values cannot be interpreted properly in the absence of knowledge about the occurrence probabilities of co-occurring entities.
It is worth noting that Poisson-binomial Z-scores are distinguished from Gaussian Z-scores by the fact that they do not correspond to the same P-value for different PBDs, BBDs, and even BDs. This is because the Z-score is an explicit part of the function defining the normal probability density while it is not part of the definitions of BD, PBD, and BBD densities. As a consequence, the simple Poisson-binomial Z-score based approach to evaluating significance of co-occurrence must be complemented with the BBD to approximate Poisson-binomial P-values in order to enable multiple testing corrections and to allow calculation of confidence levels in association studies precisely. However, NetCutter is equipped with a bipartite graph randomization tool that permits measuring the number of false positives due to multiple testing directly by comparing the number of significant co-occurrence modules in the real bipartite graph to the corresponding number in a randomized version thereof. Randomization is performed by edge-swapping in order to preserve vertex degrees. The resulting signal-to-noise ratios that are plotted for each Z-score/P-value cutoff provide a highly reliable and visually intuitive defense mechanism against false positives (see also supplementary material Simulation S1).
In the vast majority of co-occurrence studies, pair-wise co-occurrences have been analyzed using different statistical models. We have observed that the stringency of pair-wise co-occurrence analysis is far below the stringency of co-occurrence analysis using higher order combinations of co-occurring entities [35]. In NetCutter, co-occurrence analysis is preceded by occurrence analysis, i.e. the occurrence probability of each entry in each list is determined. Starting from occurrence probabilities, co-occurrence probabilities for any size of co-occurrence modules under study can be obtained by multiplying the respective list-specific occurrence probabilities. Given the list-specific co-occurrence probabilities, bi-binomial P-values are then calculated in exactly the same way for any module size. As a consequence, NetCutter can perform co-occurrence analysis for higher order combinations of co-occurring entries (i.e. larger module sizes) using the same statistical model. One of the benefits of using higher module sizes is robustness of the analyses in the presence of noise. This is because each edge in the resulting co-occurrence network is evaluated many times since every pair of co-occurring entries can be part of many higher order co-occurrence modules [35]. Another advantage is that implicit relationships between entries, which have never occurred together [18], can be derived as a natural by-product of using module sizes larger than 2. As shown in a simulation study (supplementary material Simulation S1), the result is a dramatic reduction of misclassifications at higher module sizes.
NetCutter can be used to calculate the strength of association between a subset of entries and lists reporting those entries. In this case, the analysis is performed on a subgraph of the original bipartite graph. The subgraph can correspond to communities of entries in the co-occurrence network, or any set of entries of interest. NetCutter will then calculate the significance of observing a given number of occurrences of an entry in the user defined subset of lists using bi-binomal statistics. This analysis mode corresponds to association studies with the advantage that the structure of the underlying bipartite graph (i.e. list length heterogeneity) is considered and handled appropriately using the bi-binomial distribution. As a consequence, association studies can be performed with higher stringency.
This result can be understood by examining the occurrence probability matrix that is implicitly assumed in performing binomial or hypergeometric tests for the significance of overlaps. In both tests, a gene is assumed to have an equal opportunity to be present in a list. Therefore, the probability of success for a gene to be part of a list is given by the list vertex degree divided by the total number of genes. In other words, both tests are implicitly based on the list vertex degree model, which has been shown previously to underestimate the occurrence probability and the expected number of co-occurrences for genes with high vertex degree (see Fig. 2A). Since the BBD P-values are calculated from the ES-model, which assigns higher occurrence probabilities to genes with higher vertex degree and more expected co-occurrences, the observed number of overlaps between a set of genes of interest and the content of a given list (which can be viewed as co-occurrence of the overlapping genes in that list) will be judged less significant when the overlapping genes are of high vertex degree (and vice versa when the overlapping genes are of low vertex degree) as compared to binomial or hypergeometric tests. Since the BBD P-values are derived from the most stringent ES null-model, BBD P-values provide a more reliable estimate for the significance of overlap.
Co-occurrence analysis of data represented as bipartite graphs permits visualizing the structure of the bipartite graph either as communities of list entries (genes) or as communities of lists (PubMedID_ListID) in co-occurrence networks. We have analyzed the PubLiME data set for the presence of corresponding gene and list clusters. In addition to previously published clusters of genes, we describe a novel gene cluster that is composed of protein biosynthesis associated genes [35]. We found that the corresponding clusters of PubMedID_ListID (gene expression signatures) are in general strongly enriched for genes reported in the corresponding gene cluster and that interrogation of corresponding clusters can be used to deduct hypotheses about the putative function of gene clusters.
In addition to co-occurrence analysis, NetCutter offers a number of tools for the analysis of co-occurrence networks, or any undirected graph. In particular, community identification is supported by four different community identification algorithms. NetCutter also offers a range of convenience functions that are of help in network analysis. Worthy of mentioning are the random graph generators that can provide control graphs for topological studies. The complete set of options is described in the software documentation.
In summary, we present a general framework for co-occurrence analysis with many potential applications. We illustrate a number of advantages of using the bipartite graph representation of data and the associated statistics. In particular, the identification of corresponding clusters permits the identification of functional subunits such as gene clusters on the one hand, and the generation of hypotheses about the function of those units by analyzing the corresponding list clusters on the other hand. Future developments will be directed towards the analysis of data sets that are considerably larger than the data sets analyzed so far. For example, co-occurrence analysis might be of interest for the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data sets and association studies of genome variability with disease. Each <span class="blue">patient</span> is characterized by a specific range of SNPs. Co-occurrence patterns of <span class="yellow">patients</span> according to their SNPs could be compared to clinical parameters with the aim of identifying genomic regions associated with disease. The increased stringency of association studies offered by NetCutter may be of use in the analysis of polygenic diseases where conventional methods fail. For being useful in this setting, NetCutter must be capable of analyzing bipartite graphs with millions instead of thousands of vertices.<br><br>Materials and Methods
Implementation of NetCutter
NetCutter is written in Java using NetBeans6 software (http://www.netbeans.info/) and tested on the Java Runtime environment 1.6.0.0. on a Windows XP Professional computer. The Java Runtime environment, which can be downloaded from http://java.sun.com/, must be installed on a computer that is intended to run NetCutter. NetCutter is provided as a single jar file and should run by double clicking the jar file, provided that the Java runtime environment is properly installed. NetCutter makes use of the following software packages and classes: JUNG version 1.3 (http://jung.sourceforge.net/download.html), Apache Jakarta Commons Collections 3.1 (http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/collections/), Cern Colt Scientific Library 1.2.0 (http://dsd.lbl.gov/hoschek/colt/), Xerces (http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/index.html), Jama (http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/), Netlib Java LAPACK (http://www.netlib.org/lapack/), JFreeChart (http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/), partition.java (http://astro.u-strasbg.fr/fmurtagh/mda-sw/java/partition.java).<br><br>Bi-binomial approximation of Poisson-binomial distribution
The Poisson-binomial distribution (binomial distribution with trial specific probabilities) has recently been proposed as a statistic that properly handles largely differing sizes of gene expression signatures in meta-analysis of gene expression data [35]. Z-scores have been used to estimate the significance of co-occurrence because P-value calculation is cumbersome and error prone. Two methods reported by [36] suffer from numerical overflow/underflow problems when large numbers of Poisson trials with probabilities deviating significantly from 0.5 are being analyzed. Therefore, we propose a fast approximation of P-values based on a bi-binomial distribution. The bi-binomial distribution is a special case of the Poisson-binomial distribution where the probability of success can assume only two values. In order to achieve a good approximation of the underlying Poisson-binomial distribution, the values of these two probabilities and the number of trials where they are assumed must be determined carefully. As is shown in the following, the values of the two trial probabilities and their number of occurrences follow from the formula used to calculate the variance of the Poisson-binomial distribution and from the formula yielding the population variance of trial probabilities of the Poisson-binomial distribution to be approximated.
The mean μ and the variance σ2 of the Poisson-binomial distribution are given by equation (1) and (2), respectively.(1)(2)pi is the trial-specific probability of success and N is the total number of trials. For the sake of completeness, a formal proof of equation (1) is reported as supplementary material Proof S1 and the proof of equation (2) can be obtained in an analogous fashion.
The population variance S2 of trial probabilities pi is given by equation (3).(3)
Rearranging equation (3) considering (1) and (2) leads to (4) and (5), where pa denotes the average trial probability of success and qa its complement.(4)(5)Now let's define two trial probabilities p1 and p2, which are used N1 and N2 times during the Poisson trials, respectively. Thus, N1 and N2 add up to N.(6)
Considering (1), the average trial probability pa can then be obtained from (7).(7)
Using (7), p1 can thus be calculated as (8).(8)
Similarly, considering (2), the variance σ2 is given by (9).(9)
Substituting p1 in (9) using (8) followed by substituting σ2 in (5) by (9) leads to a quadratic equation for p2 as a function of pa, N, and S2, as shown in equation (10).(10)
The solution to (10) is given by (11).(11)
Setting p2 to(12)p1 can be obtained from (8) and shown to be given by formula (13):(13)Choosing p2 as(12a)leads to p1(13a)
Comparing (13a) to (12) and (12a) to (13), it can be seen that the formulae are identical except for the fact that N1 and N2 are reversed. Since the assignment of which set of trials is called N1 and which set of trials is called N2 is completely arbitrary, we can limit the remaining analysis on (12) and (13) without loss of generality.
Note that (12) and (13) do not guarantee that p1 and p2 are always confined between 0 and 1 for any combination of N1 and N2. While probabilities smaller than 0 or bigger than 1 would still result in a distribution with the same overall variance as the original distribution, P-value calculation will be imprecise because the tails of the distribution will deviate significantly from the original distribution. Thus, we need to define the values N1 and N2 in such a way that p2< = 1 and p1> = 0. This can be achieved by evaluating (12) and (13).
Evaluating (12) for the condition that p2< = 1, solving the resulting inequality for N2, and considering (5), which relates S2 and σ2, we obtain (14).(14)
Similarly, evaluating (13) for the condition p1> = 0, solving the resulting inequality for N2, considering (5), which relates S2 and σ2, and defining μf the expected number of failures as N * (1−pa) (15),(15)we obtain (16)(16)
The meaning of these boundaries is best illustrated by considering a Poisson-binomial distribution whose variance is 0, i.e. that assumes 1 at X = μ and 0 otherwise. In this case (14) requires N2< = μ while (16) requires N2> = μ. These conditions can only be fulfilled contemporaneously when N2 is set to μ. Intuitively, this means that there are μ trials with probability of success 1 and N−μ trials with probability of 0, resulting in a Poisson-binomial distribution with variance σ2 = 0 and mean μ. When σ2 is larger than 0, the choice of N1 and N2 is more flexible. However, since the choice of N2 = μ is valid for all possible values of σ2, this is how NetCutter determines N1 and N2. When μ is not an integer, N2 is set to the integer closest to μ.
Having determined p2 (12) and p1 (13) as well a N1 and N2 (14, 16, 6), we can now calculate the bi-binomial approximation of the Poisson-binomial distribution in a fashion that is very similar to calculate the binomial P-value. With q1 = 1−p1 and q2 = 1−p2 we obtain:(17)
The summation is necessary because i successes can be obtained from any combination of j p1 and i−j p2 trials, where j can assume any value from 0 to i.<br><br>Calculating Jaccard and uncertainty coefficients
For the purpose of comparing the efficacy of the bi-binomial distribution as a significance measure of co-occurrence, Jaccard and uncertainty coefficients (which are also called measures of association) were calculated using the formulae:
The Jaccard coefficient J is calculated as the number of times A and B occur together divided by the number of times A occurs without B plus the number of times B occurs without A plus the number of times A and B occur together [42].
The uncertainty coefficient [42] is calculated as:H is the entropy associated with A, B, and AB. For A, the entropy is calculated from the probabilities of A occurring in n1 out of N lists (n1/N) and A not occurring in n2 out of N lists (n2/N). Analogous calculations lead to the entropy associated with B. For H(A,B), the probabilities of A occurring without B, B occurring without A, A and B occurring together, and neither A nor B occurring in the lists are used.<br><br>Co-occurrence analysis of the PubLiME data set
The bipartite graph to be analyzed is composed of 27619 PubMedID_listID-gene pairs (see supplementary material Table S1). Edge-swapping (1000 simulations, see above) was used to determine occurrence probabilities and gene co-occurrence was analyzed using module size 3 (co-occurrence of three genes), bi-binomial Z-score cutoff 6, bi-binomial P-value cutoff 1.0E-5, and support 5. Supplementary material Simulation S1 provides details on why module size 3 is chosen. The support parameter ensures that each 3-gene co-occurrence module is present in at least 5 signatures. We identified 1654 significant modules in the test data compared to 5 modules in a randomized bipartite graph, corresponding to a signal-to-noise ratio of 331. The co-occurrence network was generated from the significant co-occurrence modules by drawing an edge between each pair wise combination of genes that are part of the same co-occurrence module. Gene communities were identified in this network by edge-betweenness clustering removing 4 edges, which resulted in a maximal network modularity of 0.63. Modularity is calculated as described by [43].
For the identification of PubMedID_listID clusters, the PubMedID_listID-gene pairs in the original bipartite graph were reversed to form gene-PubMedID_listID pairs. Occurrence probabilities were obtained by transposing the original occurrence probability matrix determined by edge-swapping as described above. PubMedID_listID co-occurrence was analyzed using module size 5, Z-score cutoff 6, bi-binomial P-value cutoff 1.0E-5, and support 3. Please note that the choice of these parameters is dictated by the parameters used in gene co-occurrence analysis. The reversal of the bipartite graph necessitates the support parameter used in gene co-occurrence analysis (5) to be used as module size in PubMedID_listID co-occurrence analysis and the module size used in gene co-occurrence analysis (3) to be used as the support parameter in PubMedID_listID co-occurrence analysis if the scope of the analysis is the identification of PubMedID_listID clusters that correspond to gene clusters identified before. The significance cutoffs remain unchanged. PubMedID_listID co-occurrence analysis revealed 448 significant co-occurrence modules in the real bipartite graph and 6 significant co-occurrence modules in the randomized bipartite graph with a signal-to-noise ratio of 75. Communities in the resulting co-occurrence network were identified by edge-betweenness clustering removing 130 edges. The resulting maximal network modularity was found to be 0.47.<br><br>

<h3>pmcA2575403</h3>Foamy Macrophages from Tuberculous <span class="yellow">Patients</span>' Granulomas Constitute a Nutrient-Rich Reservoir for <span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span> Persistence
Abstract
Tuberculosis (TB) is characterized by a tight interplay between <span class="yellow">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</span> and host cells within granulomas. These cellular aggregates restrict bacterial spreading, but do not kill all the bacilli, which can persist for years. In-depth investigation of <span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span> interactions with granuloma-specific cell populations are needed to gain insight into mycobacterial persistence, and to better understand the physiopathology of the disease. We have analyzed the formation of foamy macrophages (FMs), a granuloma-specific cell population characterized by its high lipid content, and studied their interaction with the tubercle bacillus. Within our in vitro <span class="yellow">human</span> granuloma model, <span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span> long chain fatty acids, namely oxygenated mycolic acids (MA), triggered the differentiation of <span class="yellow">human</span> monocyte-derived macrophages into FMs. In these cells, mycobacteria no longer replicated and switched to a dormant non-replicative state. Electron microscopy observation of <span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span>–infected FMs showed that the mycobacteria-containing phagosomes migrate towards host cell lipid bodies (LB), a process which culminates with the engulfment of the bacillus into the lipid droplets and with the accumulation of lipids within the microbe. Altogether, our results suggest that oxygenated mycolic acids from <span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span> play a crucial role in the differentiation of macrophages into FMs. These cells might constitute a reservoir used by the tubercle bacillus for long-term persistence within its <span class="yellow">human</span> host, and could provide a relevant model for the screening of new antimicrobials against non-replicating persistent mycobacteria.<br><br>Introduction
Tuberculosis caused by <span class="yellow">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</span> (<span class="yellow">M.tb</span>) remains one of the leading causes of mortality in the world, with around 2 million deaths each year [1]. Most individuals remain asymptomatic after the primary infection with only 10% at risk of developing an active disease during their life [2]. In asymptomatic individuals, the bacilli are not cleared but rather persist in a dormant state, from which they may reactivate and induce clinical disease at later stages [3].
The prognosis of the disease depends on the host's efficiency to constrain the bacilli at the site of infection. When inhaled <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> reach the lungs, they are internalized by lung macrophages. The latter trigger the accumulation at the infectious site of macrophages, lymphocytes and dendritic cells, to form a granuloma, which is a major histo-pathological feature of TB. Within granulomas, macrophages differentiate into epithelioïd cells (differentiated macrophages), and/or fuse to form multinucleated giant cells (MGC). Macrophages with large numbers of lipid-free vacuoles, as well as macrophages filled with lipid-containing bodies, also called foamy macrophages (FM) are also found within granulomatous structures in both experimental animal models and <span class="yellow">human</span> disease [4],[5]. The above cells are surrounded by a rim of lymphocytes, and at later stages, a tight coat of fibroblasts encloses the structure [6]. Although the structure and cell composition of granulomas are well known, the biology of these inflammatory structures and, more specifically, the role of granuloma-specific cell types, remain largely unknown.
We have previously developed an in vitro model of <span class="yellow">human</span> tuberculous granulomas to gain insight into the survival strategies of the tubercle bacillus within its <span class="yellow">human</span> host. This model now enables the characterization of granuloma-specific cell types, and their modulation by <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> [7]. The main advantage of this model over in vivo animal models or ex vivo <span class="yellow">human</span> biopsy samples, is the availability of live granuloma cells which facilitates analysis of their cell biology. Using this model we have recently shown that, within granulomas, large multinucleated giant cells, also known as Langhans giant cells, result from the induction of granuloma macrophage fusion by <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> glycolipids [8]. We have shown that these cells have lost the ability to mediate bacterial uptake upon maturation, but have conserved their ability to mediate antigen presentation [9].
The differentiation of macrophages into FMs has been particularly well described in individuals developing a postprimary, also known as secondary or adult, TB. These postprimary infections are considered to be the result of re-infection or reactivation of a primary TB [10]. FMs have been described in leprosy <span class="yellow">patients</span> or <span class="yellow">M. avium</span>-infected AIDS (Acquired ImmunoDeficiency Syndrome) <span class="yellow">patients</span>, and in chronic stages of <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> infection in <span class="yellow">mice</span> [4],[11],[12]. The foamy aspect of these macrophages is the result of intracellular lipid accumulation within lipid bodies, also called lipid droplets or lipid vacuoles [13],[14],[15]. In an experimental model of leukocyte infection, it was recently suggested that BCG (Bacille Calmette Guerin) infection can induce, in a TLR2-dependent fashion, the rapid formation of lipid bodies carrying out part of the eicosanoïd biosynthesis that usually accompanies the infection, thus pointing to an active role for lipid bodies during the course of infection [16]. However, the mechanisms regulating this lipid accumulation during mycobacterial infection and their significance in the physiopathology of tuberculosis are not understood. Most of the studies on TB granulomas have focused on the contribution of host components, but very little is known about the role played by bacterial constituents in terms of granuloma formation and progression.
The present work was aimed at deciphering the role of FMs in <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> survival within <span class="yellow">human</span> granulomas. To test our working hypothesis according to which FMs constitute a nutrient-rich reservoir for <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> persistence, we used our in vitro model of <span class="yellow">human</span> granulomas to analyze the formation of FMs and their role during <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> infection. We showed that only highly virulent mycobacteria (<span class="yellow">M.tb</span>, <span class="yellow">M. avium</span>) and not saprophytic ones (<span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>) could induce the formation of FMs in mature granulomas. Moreover, we demonstrated that oxygenated mycolic acids specifically produced by the above pathogenic species were responsible for FMs formation. Once differentiated, FMs were unable to mediate phagocytosis of new bacilli and their microbicidal activity was reduced. <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> was not killed in FMs but instead persisted in a non-replicating state, and over-expressed dormancy genes. Noteworthy, in foamy macrophages, <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>-containing phagosomes were shown to migrate towards lipid bodies which they progressively surrounded and engulfed. As a result, bacteria were freed into lipid bodies, thus favoring the bacilli's access to nutrients. From these data, we propose that FMs could form a secure reservoir for the tubercle bacilli.<br><br>Methods
<span class="yellow">Human</span> samples
<span class="yellow">Human</span> blood samples, purchased from the French National Blood provider of Toulouse, were collected from fully anonymized non-tuberculous control donors, an ethical committee approval was, therefore, not necessary. This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Helsinki Declaration, with informed consent obtained from each donor.
We chose to work on lymph node samples rather than lung biopsies, which are usually only paraffin-embedded, because staining for lipids can only be performed on frozen samples. Lymph node biopsies were taken for diagnosis purposes, in ten non-<span class="yellow">HIV</span> <span class="yellow">patients</span>. For each biopsy, a fragment was sent to the microbiology laboratory, another was frozen in liquid nitrogen and the main part was fixed in formalin and paraffin-embedded for histological examination. <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> was identified in 9 lymph node biopsies and from the lung aspiration in the last <span class="blue">patient</span>. This latter case showed no signs of necrosis, and no FMs were found in the lymph node biopsy. This study complies with the guidelines of the declaration of Helsinki.<br><br>Bacterial strains and culture conditions
Wild-type <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span> and <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>/hma strains were previously described [17], <span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span>-GFP were a kind gift from Dr. C. Guilhot (CNRS-IPBS, Toulouse France). Bacilli were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 medium (Difco) supplemented with 10% albumin–dextrose–catalase (Difco). Fluorescent <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span> and <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>/hma were obtained by FITC labelling as described in [18].<br><br>Isolation of RNA from intraphagosomal <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>
Six and 12 days post-infection (MOI 10), macrophages and FMs (5×106) were washed twice with PBS, scraped off the cell dishes and recovered by centrifugation. The cell pellets were lysed with lysis buffer (RNEasy mini kit, Quiagen) and transferred to 2 ml Eppendorf-tubes containing a 0.5 ml suspension of 0.1 mm-diameter glass beads (Biospec). Mycobacteria were disrupted using a bead beater (Retsch) followed by a 5 min centrifugation at 14 000g. RNA contained in the supernatant was then column-purified according to the manufacturer's conditions using the RNEasy mini kit (Qiagen) and quantified.<br><br>Quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR
In RNA samples DNA contamination was excluded by DNAse I treatment (Ambion). 1 µg total RNA was reverse-transcribed using random hexamer primers (Ambion) and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was performed on cDNA using the SYBR green essay (Applied Biosystems). Reverse and forward primers used are listed below in Table 1. Fluorescence was measured by ABIPrism 7300 (Applied Biosystems). The calculated threshold cycle (Ct) value for each gene of interest was normalized to the Ct value for 16S and the fold expression was calculated using the formula: fold change = 2−Δ.(ΔCt) [19]. Real-time PCR conditions include initial activation at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec, annealing and extension at 65°C for 1 min. The gene induction ratios were obtained by comparing gene expression levels in intracellular bacilli with those of log-phase in vitro-grown bacilli. RNAs were isolated from two independent macrophage infections.<br><br>In vitro <span class="yellow">human</span> granuloma formation
In vitro granulomas were obtained as previously described [7]. Briefly, 1×106 freshly isolated Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) were incubated with 1×104 viable <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>, or 1×103 viable <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span> or <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>/hma. The culture medium was RPMI-1640+Glutamax (Difco), containing 7.5% <span class="yellow">human</span> AB serum (Sigma-Aldrich).<br><br>Macrophage differentiation
2.5×106 PBMCs prepared in RPMI-1640+Glutamax (Difco) were plated over coverslips in 24-well plates. After 2 h culture at 37°C, cells were washed 3 times with PBS and then refed with RPMI-1640+Glutamax (Difco), containing 7.5% <span class="yellow">human</span> AB serum. After 6 days of culturing, macrophages were differentiated.<br><br>Respiratory burst assay with Nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)
<span class="yellow">Human</span> monocyte derived macrophages were stimulated with <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>/hma for 2 h at 37°C, washed and reincubated in mycobacterium-free medium. After 2 days of differentiation into FMs, macrophages were co-stained with NBT (2 mg/ml Sigma-Aldrich) and Nile red (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at 37°C. Stained cells were fixed and then analysed with an inverted microscope (Nikon TE 300).<br><br>Phagocytosis and Survival test
For phagocytosis assays, differentiated macrophages were incubated with <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>/hma mycolic acids for 2 days and then infected with 1×108 labeled mycobacteria per well for 90 min, washed 3 times with PBS and chased for 3 h in fresh culture medium.
For survival experiments, macrophages were infected with <span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span>-GFP (10 bacteria/cell), washed 3 times with PBS (Gibco) and re-incubated in fresh culture medium. At selected time points thereafter (1, 3, 6, 10 and 14 days) cells were labeled with Nile red (Sigma-Aldrich), fixed and observed under a confocal microscope. The amount of mycobacteria per cells was evaluated. (100 cells were analyzed for each time point).<br><br>Lipid body staining and immunostaining
Granuloma cells were collected and plated onto glass coverslips with a cytospin (Thermo Shandon) fixed for 30 min in PBS-PFA 4% and stained with Oil red-O (Sigma-Aldrich) as described [20]. The slides were then counterstained with haematoxylin (Dako Cytomation) and observed under an inverted microscope (Nikon TE 300).
For fluorescence analysis, granuloma cells or macrophages were collected in PBS, lipid bodies were stained with Nile red (Sigma-Aldrich, 0.1 µg/ml, from a stock solution in methanol) for 15 min washed with PBS, fixed for 30 min in PBS-PFA 4%, mounted with the fluorescent mounting medium (Dako Cytomation) and observed under a confocal microscope.
In order to distinguish the lipids contained within lipid bodies, from those of the cell membrane, we used the fluorescent emission spectrum properties of Nile red which depend upon the kind of lipid associated with Nile red, i.e. for triacylglycerol: λmax em = 590 nm, for phospholipids: λmax em = 640 nm (Molecular Probes handbook). On confocal microscopy pictures, the phospholipid background of both macrophages and FM appears in red and the triacylglycerol-rich lipid bodies appear in white. Cells were considered to be positive for Nile red staining when more than 50% of the cell surface was stained (see Figure S2).<br><br>Mycolic acid isolation
Bacterial residues obtained after lipid extraction with organic solvents [17] were saponified with a mixture of 40% KOH aqueous solution and methoxyethanol (1∶7, v/v) at 110°C for 3 hours in a screw-capped tube. After acidification, fatty acids were extracted with diethylether, derivatised into methyl esters with diazomethane and analyzed by analytical thin-layer chromatography on silica Gel 60 (Silica Gel 60 Macherey-Nagel) using either dicholoromethane or petroleum ether/diethylether (9∶1, v/v, five runs). Visualization of lipid spots was performed by spraying the plates with molybdophosphoric acid (10% in ethanol), followed by charring.<br><br>Processing for electron microscopy
Granulomas were fixed for 1 hour at room temperature with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.1 M sucrose, 5 mM CaCl2 and 5 mM MgCl2. After two successive 15-min washes with the same buffer, the granulomas were postfixed for 1 hour at RT with 1% osmium tetroxide (Electron Microscopy Science) in the same buffer devoid of sucrose. The granulomas were scraped off the culture dishes with a rubber policeman and concentrated in 1% agarose in the same buffer. After a one hour treatment at room temperature with 1% uranyl acetate in Veronal buffer, the samples were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and embedded in Spurr resin. Thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.<br><br>Image acquisition in confocal microscopy
The images were obtained using a Leica confocal fluorescence microscope (SP2) equipped with a Plan Apo 40×1.4 Ph 6 objective (Olympus Optical) and CoolSNAP-Pro CF digital camera in conjunction with Image-Pro Plus version 4.5.1.3 software (Media Cybernetics). The images were edited using Adobe Photoshop CS2 9 software (Adobe Systems).<br><br>
Results
Foamy macrophages are strongly associated with necrotic lesions and often contain <span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span>
We analyzed lymph node biopsies from 10 tuberculous <span class="yellow">patients</span> as a first step for evaluating the role of FMs within tuberculous granulomas. A section through a representative biopsy is shown in Figure 1. Well-circumscribed and -differentiated granulomatous structures were observed in all the samples (Figure 1A). Classically, lesions display a necrotic center (N), an interface area between the necrotic center and the histiocytes (I), and some peripheral granulomas (G). Only seven out of ten <span class="yellow">patients</span> presented lesions displaying central necrosis (Table 2). Staining of the histology samples with Oil red-O, a classic lipid stain, confirmed the presence of FMs within the granulomatous structures in six out of seven samples presenting necrosis (Figure 1B), whereas no FMs were found in the three non-necrotic lesions (Table 2). Noteworthy, in samples with necrotic areas, FMs were always found in the interface region flanking the central necrosis (Figure 1B). These observations firstly confirmed the presence of FMs in most TB <span class="yellow">patients</span>' lesions thereby suggesting that these cells play an important role in the formation/maintenance of such lesions. Second, FMs seem to be associated with necrosis, which is a hallmark of TB lesions, since they were observed only in lesions with a necrotic center and preferentially located around the necrotic area.
Interestingly, staining, in parallel, of serial thin sections from a <span class="blue">patient</span>'s lesion biopsy with Oil red-O (Figure 1C) and Ziehl Nielsen (Figure 1D), showed that most of the bacilli (arrow) were located in the same area as FMs, thus suggesting a strong association between the persisting tubercle bacilli and FMs within granulomas.<br><br><span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span> induces the formation of FMs within in vitro <span class="yellow">human</span> tuberculous granulomas
To further characterize the role of FMs in the granulomatous response, we assessed whether FM formation in granulomatous structures was triggered only by pathogenic mycobacterial species (<span class="yellow">M.tb</span>), or by low virulent ones (<span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>) as well. PBMCs from non-tuberculous control individuals were infected with <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> or <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>, following the procedure previously described for the induction of granulomatous structures ([7],[9] and Figure S1). Granuloma cells collected at days 3 and 11 were stained with Oil red-O to visualize the lipid droplets within FMs under the light microscope (Figure 2). At day 3, several <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>-induced granuloma cells already showed lipid bodies (Figure 2A). In contrast, the cells collected from <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>-induced granulomas were seldom (5%) positively stained (Figure 2B). Interestingly, <span class="yellow">M. avium</span> induced FM formation in a similar way to <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> (not shown). By day 11, the amount of positively stained cells had increased in <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>-induced granulomas, but not in <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>-induced ones. In addition, the number of lipid bodies per cell increased dramatically with time, as depited in the enlarged views (Figures 2A, C). The quantitative evaluation of the percentage of FMs within granulomas induced by both strains confirmed the differences observed under the light microscope, and showed a seven-fold difference (44% vs 6% respectively) between <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> and <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span> in terms of their ability to induce FM formation (Figure 2D). Our results therefore show that virulent species such as <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> and <span class="yellow">M. avium</span>, contrary to poorly or avirulent ones such as <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>, are able to induce the formation of FMs within our experimental model.<br><br>Oxygenated mycolic acids induce the maturation of macrophages into FMs
Mycolic acids from <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> incorporated into liposomes were recently shown to trigger the differentiation of <span class="yellow">mice</span> peritoneal macrophages into foamy-like cells [21]. Interestingly, both <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> and <span class="yellow">M. avium</span>, which induce FM formation, express a family of oxygenated mycolic acids, especially ketomycolic acids, which are not produced by <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span> (Figure 3A). In this context, inactivation of the <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> hma gene (mmaA4-Rv0642c) was shown to abolish the synthesis of oxygenated keto- and hydroxyl-mycolic acid in the mutant strain [17]. Conversely, transforming <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span> with the hma gene induced the production of both keto- and hydroxyl-mycolic acids [22], (Figures 3B, C).
In the light of both data, we anticipated that oxygenated mycolic acids specifically produced by <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> and <span class="yellow">M. avium</span>, under the control of hma, are responsible for FM formation within <span class="yellow">human</span> granulomas. To test this hypothesis, we compared FM formation after infection of PBMCs with either the wild-type, or the hma-expressing <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span> strain (<span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>/hma). Granulomas cells were collected 3 days later and stained with Oil red-O to visualize lipid bodies. Wild-type <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>-induced granulomas displayed only 5.5% of FM, whereas the hma gene-expressing strain induced granulomas bearing a majority (67%) of brightly stained Oil red-O positive cells (Figures 4A, B, C). Induction of FM formation was even greater if isolated macrophages were directly infected with either strain. After only 4 hours of infection, <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>/hma had already transformed 64% of the infected macrophages into lipid body-positive cells (see Figure S2 for Nile red positive cells), whereas only 9% of the cells contained lipid bodies after infection with the wild-type strain (Figures 4D, E, F). To confirm the specific role of hma-dependent oxygenated mycolic acids in FM formation, and to rule out a possible combined effect of oxygenated mycolic-acids with other mycobacterial components, mycolic acids isolated from wild-type <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span> or <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>/hma were incubated with isolated macrophages. With mycolic acids isolated from the wild-type strain, only 13% of the macrophages were transformed into FM whereas 66% of the macrophages incubated with mycolic acids isolated from <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>/hma were strongly stained for lipid bodies (Figures 4G, H, I).
These results therefore indicate that oxygenated mycolic acids play a leading role in <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>-induced FM formation.<br><br>The phagocytic and bactericidal activities are arrested in FMs
To assess the function of granuloma FM, we first evaluated the ability of such cells to mediate phagocytosis. For this purpose, macrophages isolated from PBMCs were exposed to <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>/hma-derived mycolic acids to induce FM formation. Two days later, the cell population contained a mixture of FM (50–70%) and macrophages (30–50%), as assessed by Nile red staining (not shown). The mixed cell population was infected with FITC-labelled <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>. Intracellular bacilli were found only within Nile red-negative macrophages thereby indicating that FMs are unable to ingest bacteria (Figure 5A). This result was reproduced using other mycobacterial strains, such as <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> and <span class="yellow">M. bovis BCG</span>, for infection (not shown). These results further suggest that the bacilli found in granuloma FMs were internalized by macrophages prior to their transformation into FMs.
To assess whether FMs are able to develop a respiratory burst, which is a major intracellular bactericidal activity, the ability of Nile red positive cells (i.e. FMs) to mediate NBT reduction was determined. As shown in Figure 5D, only 8% of the NBT-positive cells (Figure 5B) were Nile red positive FMs (Figure 5C). This strongly suggests that once macrophages have differentiated into FMs, they lose the ability to mediate intracellular bactericidal activity. We postulate that FMs could, therefore, form a secure reservoir for the tubercle bacilli.<br><br><span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span> persists in a dormant non-replicative state in FMs
To evaluate the validity of the above hypothesis, we analyzed the ability of <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> to replicate within FMs. For this purpose, isolated macrophages were infected with <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>. At selected intervals post-infection, the amount of bacilli per cell was compared in both non-differentiated macrophages and FMs (Figure 5E). Until day 6, <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> replicated in a similar fashion in both cell types. In contrast, after day 6 post-infection, the amount of bacilli remained stationary in FMs, whereas it continued to increase in macrophages. It is interesting to note that arrest of bacterial replication coincided with completion of macrophage differentiation into FM, i.e. starting from day 3 post-infection. Our data suggest, that the bacilli found in granuloma FMs were internalized by macrophages prior to their differentiation into FMs and also that bacilli can terminate their replication cycle while macrophages are being transformed into FM, but that replication comes to a halt as soon as the maturation process is complete.
We next determined whether the non-replicative bacilli observed in FMs were still alive. For this purpose, we analyzed the expression of a series of genes known to be up-regulated when bacilli are in a persistent non-replicating state [23],[24]. RNA was, therefore, prepared from both in vitro-grown <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> and intracellular bacilli at day 6 and 12 post-infection. The respective amounts of RNA corresponding to isocitrate lyase, α-cristallin, a very hypothetical 7.6 kDa protein, CHP and DosR proteins were then quantified by RT-PCR. As shown in Table 3, the dormancy genes were all strongly up-regulated in intracellular bacilli at day 12 post-infection. These results further demonstrate that the bacilli are not killed in FMs, but rather persist in a dormant, and therefore non-replicative stage [25]. Interestingly, the dormancy genes were not as strongly expressed at day 6, time at which bacteria were still able to replicate in macrophages undergoing differentiation into FMs.<br><br>Characterization of <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> survival within FMs and interaction with lipid bodies
To gain further insight into the morphological appearance of <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> within FM and into the interactions between FM lipid bodies (LB) and <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>-containing phagosomes, granulomas were fixed and processed for conventional electron microscopy at days 3 and 11 post-infection.
Whatever the time point at which granuloma cells were observed, bacteria were all enclosed in phagosomes, most of which contained a single bacterium. None of them (over a thousand which were examined under the electron microscope) were free in the cytoplasm and only one was enclosed in a classical autophagic vacuole. At day 3 post-infection, FMs profiles (thin sections) were scarce, representing at most 9% of the total population of macrophage profiles observed under the electron microscope (Figure 6A). In addition, 86% of the FM profiles displayed at most 5 small LBs (Figure 6B). At this stage of granuloma formation, bacteria were infrequent in FM, but were found in other types of macrophages. One of these displayed large numbers of vacuoles containing flocculent material and often one or two LBs. Over 95% of the bacteria located in the different granuloma macrophages were morphologically intact, and therefore alive [26]. Intact bacteria present no breaks in the cell wall or cytoplasmic membrane and their cytoplasm has preserved its ultrastructural organization and electron opacity. Furthermore, they display no electron translucent intracytoplasmic lipid inclusions (ILI). Bacteria were also observed in between cells, probably as a result of cell lysis within granulomas. These bacteria were also morphologically intact and devoid of ILI (not shown).
At day 11 post-infection, <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>-containing macrophages displaying large numbers of vacuoles with flocculent material were less frequently observed. Interestingly, the amount of such vacuoles had strongly decreased in most of these cells while the number of LBs had increased. The percentage of FM had increased to reach 41% of the total population of macrophage profiles within the granulomas (Figure 6A). From these observations, it is tempting to assume that the highly vesiculated macrophages give rise to FMs. Within FMs, the size and amount of LBs had also increased with time since 48% of the FM profiles now displayed more than 5 LB per FM thin section (Figure 6B), randomly distributed within the cells (Figure 6C). About 30% of the FM profiles displayed between 1 and 20 bacteria, which were morphologically intact and enclosed within phagosomes (Figure 6C, enlarged view).
The interaction between these bacteria and the cellular LBs was next examined at day 11. Sixty percent of the bacilli were scattered throughout the FMs and displayed no obvious signs of interaction with the cellular LBs. A small fraction of the bacteria (21%), however, were observed in the close vicinity of cellular LBs. The membrane of the phagosomes in which they were enclosed clearly interacted with cellular LBs (Figures 6C, 7A, 7B, arrows) and became tightly apposed to an increasingly larger surface area of the LB. As a result, the phagosomes started to surround LBs in a zippering fashion (Figures 7E, F). Ultimately, bacilli (19%) were translocated to cellular LBs (Figure 7C). From these observations, it is tempting to assume that <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>-containing phagosomes engulf cellular LBs rather than fusing with them. This process, which is reminiscent of autophagy, resulted in the transfer of free bacteria into the lumen of cellular LBs (Figure 7C), some of which displayed up to 21 bacteria (Figure 7G). Interestingly, only altered <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> found within FM lipid bodies exhibited electron translucent ILIs (Figures 7D, G), thereby suggesting that they are able to accumulate host cell lipids. In previous work, the term altered bacteria had been used to define live bacteria that had acquired ILIs [26]. Since the presence of ILIs within the cytoplasm of <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> is typical for non-replicating bacteria in a state of dormancy [27], this further confirms that these bacteria are dormant.<br><br>
Discussion
Studies carried out several decades ago suggested that postprimary tuberculosis starts as a lipid pneumonia [28],[29]. Indeed, following a first inflammatory process leading to exudates of mononuclear cells within alveolar spaces, early pathologists observed an accumulation of lipid droplets in alveolar macrophages of TB <span class="yellow">patients</span>. Tubercle bacilli were shown to reside in these lipid-rich macrophages which were named foamy macrophages (FMs) [30]. Recently, histo-pathological analysis of biopsies from <span class="yellow">patients</span> with untreated tuberculosis confirmed the century-old histological descriptions of postprimary tuberculosis [10]. In this study, Hunter et al showed that postprimary tuberculosis begins as a lipid pneumonia with the accumulation of large amounts of lipid-rich FMs, accompanied by bronchial obstruction. It was also shown that in alveolar foamy macrophages, the bacilli were mainly found within lipid droplets. All these observations underline the important, yet often neglected, role of lipid accumulation, and more precisely FM formation, at the infectious site in the physiopathology of TB.
In <span class="yellow">murine</span> experimental models, FMs accumulate within the outermost layer of granulomatous structures occupying the alveolar spaces during the chronic phase of infection. This strongly suggests that FMs could be involved in lesion cleaning via phagocytic uptake of cellular debris generated by the local inflammatory response. Once filled with debris, FMs would leave the parenchyma through the alveolar spaces up to the superior bronchial tree, to be finally swallowed and digested in the stomach [31]. In fact, this process is very well known, and is a crucial factor for TB diagnosis in <span class="yellow">children</span>. As <span class="yellow">infants</span> do not usually generate cavitary lesions, and because it is difficult to detect bacilli in the sputum, the diagnosis is linked to the detection of bacilli in the gastrointestinal lavage [32].
We show that <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>-induced the transformation of in vitro-grown <span class="yellow">human</span> granuloma macrophages into FMs within 6 days, and even more rapidly (3–4 hours) in cultured macrophages. Although this event occurs more quickly than in vivo, or in animal models, our data are consistent with the above in vivo observations. Within FMs, bacilli and LBs were often tightly linked, to the point that a non-negligible amount of bacteria were ultimately observed within LBs. Interestingly, some of the bacilli transferred into lipid bodies displayed their own intracytoplasmic lipid inclusions, which are considered to be one of the hallmarks of non-replicating (dormant) <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> [27]. The recent observation of persistent ILI-containing tubercle bacilli within adipocyte LBs [33] is in good agreement with our observations. Since bacilli residing in phagosomes that do not interact with cellular lipid bodies do not display ILIs, it is tempting to assume that lipids within ILIs are of cellular origin. The accumulation of lipids within bacilli [47], via interaction with FM lipid bodies could, therefore, be crucial to <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> persistence. It is indeed known that <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> accumulates lipids, and more precisely triacylglycerols, during dormancy [34],[35] from which it derives both carbon and energy for its own metabolism. Intracellular persistence of <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> is also critically linked to the acquisition of host cholesterol through the Mce4 transporter system [36].
The question that arises is how do bacteria gain access to lipids from LB? Direct fusion of phagosomes with FM lipid bodies seems unlikely as the membranes of both structures are quite different from one another. Our observations suggest instead that once <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>-containing phagosomes have established close contact with a lipid body, they surround and engulf the latter by a process that remains to be deciphered. This phenomenon is somewhat reminiscent of autophagy, as observed under conditions of cholesterol depletion in macrophages infected with <span class="yellow">M. avium</span> [37]. After degradation of the resulting inner membrane, bacteria would be freed within the lipids of the engulfed LB, and therefore be in direct contact with cellular lipids. How bacilli translocate the cellular lipids to their own cytoplasm remains to be established.
Another important phenomenon underlined by our study is the strong correlation between the presence of FMs in the granulomatous structures and the development of necrosis within the lesion, as suggested by Pagel over 80 years ago [29]. Interestingly, FMs were systematically located at the interface region between the histiocytes and the central necrosis area of the biopsied lesions. Although necrosis formation could depend on an indirect effect of the global immune response, our data indicate that the formation of FMs is an important factor favoring the appearance of necrosis. Analysis of larger series of biopsy samples are, however, needed to definitely demonstrate our actual hypothesis according to which FMs play a direct and unique role in necrosis formation. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that FMs induced from <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>-infected macrophages displayed permanent TNF-α secretion, a potent pro-necrotic factor, whereas <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>-infected macrophages were poor producers of TNF-α. At day 4 post-infection, TNF-α secretion was indeed twofold higher in macrophages (of which 70% had differentiated into FMs) infected with <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> than in those infected with <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>, as measured both by ELISA and RNA quantification (Peyron, unpublished observations). However, one must keep in mind that the association of FMs and necrosis may be the consequence of the FM cleaning process of lipoproteins released into the necrotic tissue, as observed in atherosclerosis lesions [38]. It is thus tempting to propose that <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> mycolic acids may be responsible for the development of necrotic lesions, due to their ability to induce TNF-α production by FMs. Whether mycolic acids are directly involved in TNF-α production, or only indirectly by inducing FM formation, remains a matter of debate currently under study.
Our observations are strikingly similar to the phenomena described for postprimary tuberculosis, that seems to begin as localized foci of pneumonia followed by massive necrosis leading to the formation of pulmonary cavities [10]. If this proves to be the case, then the traditionally admitted phenomenon of cavitation arising from the erosion of caseating granulomatous structures from bronchi can be ruled out [39]. In our study, we successfully induced FM formation from isolated macrophages infected with <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>, i.e. outside a granulomatous structure, which is consistent with Hunter's recent proposal.
Until now, mycolic acids have been considered to be indirectly involved in virulence mechanisms as being part of complex molecules of the mycobacterial envelope. The most widely studied mycolic acid-containing mycobacterial compound trehalose 6,6′ dimycolate (TDM), has been extensively analyzed for its role in virulence since the mid-fifties [40]. Recently, it was shown to interfere with the host granulomatous response [41]. Overall, TDM was mainly shown to mediate macrophage activation and a Th1-type response to <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> infection (for review, see [25]).
Our results demonstrate a direct role of oxygenated mycolic acids for FM formation, independently from the appearance and stage of the disease. <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>-specific mycolic acids indeed trigger the transformation of both isolated and granuloma macrophages, into FM. Given the absence of FM formation in <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>-induced granulomas, despite the induction of a comparative inflammatory response, ascertained by the similar induction of granulomas, this phenomenon clearly depends upon a direct contact with the bacilli, and not to the inflammatory response. Mycolic acids are major and hallmark components of the mycobacterial cell wall. They constitute 40–60% of dry weight of the envelope [42]. All members of the complex (e.g. <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>, <span class="yellow">Mycobacterium africanum</span>, <span class="yellow">Mycobacterium bovis</span> and <span class="yellow">Mycobacterium microti</span>) are able to synthesize the same combination of mycolic acids, i.e. cyclopropanated α-mycolic acids, ketomycolic and methoxymycolic acids [17], which are not synthesized by non-pathogenic mycobacterial species [43]. These structural specificities probably account for part of the pathogenicity of these species, as shown by the impaired virulence of mutant strains deprived of keto and methoxyl groups in experimental infections [17],[44],[45].
Our study, therefore, gives the first proof of a direct role of isolated mycolic acids in the interplay between <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> and host cells. Interestingly, this effect is expressed both by whole bacilli and isolated lipids, suggesting that oxygenated mycolic acids are either secreted by the bacilli, or exposed at the cell wall surface in a manner enabling their bioactivity. According to our results, mycolic acids trigger the formation, within granulomas, of FMs in which bacilli can hide and survive. Oxygenated mycolic acids, either free, as constituents of TDM [44], or linked to the cell wall arabinogalactan [46],[47], should, therefore, be considered as major virulence factors enabling <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> survival for long periods of time in a persistent state. Being an inducer of host lipid accumulation, and FM formation at the site of infection, these oxygenated mycolic acids could, therefore, also be responsible for the induction of necrosis within lesions, thus favoring <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> dissemination.
Interestingly, deletion of the mmaA4 (Rv0642c) gene also drastically decreased the ability of <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> to induce the differentiation of macrophages into FMs (data not shown). However, the residual ability of this mutant to induce FMs suggests that other mycobacterial factors might partially trigger the formation of FM. With regard to the mycolic acid methyltransferases, given that (i) mmaA2 (Rv0644c) and mmaA3 (Rv0643c) are pseudogenes in <span class="yellow">M. leprae</span> and (ii) mmaA4 KO present no trans cyclopropanation [45], thus excluding the involvement of the cmaA2 (Rv0503c) gene, we expect that at least pcaA (Rv0470c), which introduces cis-cyclopropane, may play the same role. Consistent with this hypothesis, a pcaA null mutant is unable to persist within infected <span class="yellow">mice</span> [46], thus demonstrating the role of a mycolic acid methyltransferase in the chronic stage of infection.
Overall, our study has shed light on a previously uncharacterized cell population participating in <span class="yellow">human</span> tuberculous granulomas, namely foamy macrophages. We propose that the specific induction of FM by <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> would create a favourable environment for persistent bacteria. In our opinion, FMs could be a safe shelter because they preserve bacilli from a direct contact with granuloma lymphocytes and histiocytes, they lose one of the major macrophage bactericidal activities and they constitute an important source of nutrients for the bacilli thanks to the fatty acids accumulated in their lipid granules.<br><br>Supporting Information<br><br>
<h3>pmcA2636785</h3>Identification of recruitment and retention strategies for rehabilitation professionals in Ontario, Canada: results from expert panels
Abstract
Background
Demand for rehabilitation services is expected to increase due to factors such as an aging population, workforce pressures, rise in chronic and complex multi-system disorders, advances in technology, and changes in interprofessional health service delivery models. However, health <span class="yellow">human</span> resource (HHR) strategies for Canadian rehabilitation professionals are lagging behind other professional groups such as physicians and nurses. The objectives of this study were: 1) to identify recruitment and retention strategies of rehabilitation professionals including occupational therapists, physical therapists and speech language pathologists from the literature; and 2) to investigate both the importance and feasibility of the identified strategies using expert panels amongst HHR and education experts.<br><br>Methods
A review of the literature was conducted to identify recruitment and retention strategies for rehabilitation professionals. Two expert panels, one on Recruitment and Retention and the other on Education were convened to determine the importance and feasibility of the identified strategies. A modified-delphi process was used to gain consensus and to rate the identified strategies along these two dimensions.<br><br>Results
A total of 34 strategies were identified by the Recruitment and Retention and Education expert panels as being important and feasible for the development of a HHR plan for recruitment and retention of rehabilitation professionals. Seven were categorized under the Quality of Worklife and Work Environment theme, another seven in Financial Incentives and Marketing, two in Workload and Skill Mix, thirteen in Professional Development and five in Education and Training.<br><br>Conclusion
Based on the results from the expert panels, the three major areas of focus for HHR planning in the rehabilitation sector should include strategies addressing Quality of Worklife and Work Environment, Financial Incentives and Marketing and Professional Development.<br><br><br><br>Background
Demand for rehabilitation services is expected to increase within the next decade primarily due to factors such as an aging population, workforce pressures, rise in chronic and complex multi-system disorders, advances in technology, and changes in health service delivery models [1-4]. In Canada, rehabilitation personnel constitute the third largest health professional group after nurses and physicians. Despite the size of this workforce, studies have consistently reported ongoing shortages of physiotherapists (PTs), occupational therapists (OTs) and speech-language pathologists (SLPs) across all jurisdictions [5-7]. Similarly, recruitment and retention of rehabilitation professionals has been considered a challenge internationally, nationally and provincially. At the international level, the literature reports recruitment and retention difficulties of rehabilitation therapists in countries such as Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom and the United States [8-13]. Provinces across Canada face similar issues; with Ontario projected to face the most difficulty due to its population growth rate [14].
Based on the Canadian Institute for Health Information's Health Personnel Trends in Canada from 1993 to 2002 report, numerous factors have been suggested to influence demand for physiotherapy and occupational therapy services. Factors that may influence increase demand for physiotherapy include: shift in health service delivery models from hospital to community care; earlier <span class="blue">patient</span> discharge; increased expectations from aging Canadians concerning more active lifestyles; growing private practice sector and continued shortages for PTs in both private and public sectors in rural, remote and urban settings across Canada [2]. In 1993, an Ontario study stated that in order to meet demands of changing health care policy, medical technology and demographic changes in the population, the PT profession required an annual growth rate of 4.4% until the year 2000 [5]. However, the national health personnel databases revealed that the actual average annual growth rate of active PTs in Canada from 1995 to 2004 was only 2.5%, approximately half of the projected requirement suggested to meet demand [15].
Similarly, in Ontario in the early 1990s an increase in demand for OTs was projected because of the reported shortage in OTs and high attrition rate [16]. The shortage of OTs was explained by another Ontario study to be the result of the changing philosophies of care and management for the disabled, and a clearer understanding of the role of OT in the physical and mental well-being of the disabled [17]. In terms of actual shortages, some authors have reported ongoing vacancies and recruitment difficulties for OTs [11,18] while others have reported an increase in demand for both PTs [19] and OTs [20].
Speech language pathology is facing similar service demands. A report released in March 2003 by the College of Audiologists and Speech-Language Pathologists of Ontario (CASLPO) concluded that based on prevalence rates for Ontario residents with speech, language and related disorders, the demand for service would increase by 13% while the number of SLPs would decrease by 4% resulting in an overall reduction in service of 15% [21]. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) has been tracking SLP vacancies. In their 2005 ASHA Speech-Language Pathology Health Care survey, 48% of respondents indicated that they had funded unfilled positions for SLPS in their agency [22]. The same survey also reported that 65% of respondents in home care indicated that job openings were more numerous than job seekers in their geographic area.
While labour market demand and supply are influential factors on recruitment and retention decisions, the development of strategies requires an understanding of conceptual frameworks or theories to categorise and explain how other underlying factors impact health worker's mobility. For example, Lehmann et al.'s model described that health worker's decisions to accept and stay in remote areas in the public sector depends on two interrelated aspects: the impact of the different environments (i.e. individual, local, work, national and international) and the location of decision-makers (i.e. local government, Ministry of Health, HR directorate, public service and other ministries)[23]. Behavioural and social science theories, such as those explained by Tett and Meyer, found that job satisfaction and organizational commitment each contribute independently to the prediction of the intention to resign (turnover), however job satisfaction was a stronger predictor than organizational commitment[24]. Based on this notion, considerable research has been devoted to identifying factors that affect job satisfaction among rehabilitation professionals. While there is no single, agreed upon model of job satisfaction, a variety of theoretical models have been studied to explain concepts and relationships associated with overall job satisfaction. The two most commonly used theories of job satisfaction for rehabilitation professionals are the Herzberg's Motivation-Hygiene Theory[25] and Mottaz's concepts of work values and work rewards [26].
A number of rehabilitation studies have used the Herzberg's Motivation-Hygiene Theory, also known as the two-factor theory of motivation to explain associations between motivation, job satisfaction and retention factors among OTs, PTs and SLPs [27-31]. Frederick Herzberg et al. explained that there were two independent incidents occurring at <span class="yellow">peoples</span>' jobs: one that made them feel good or satisfied, and another that made them feel bad or dissatisfied at work [25]. Intrinsic factors that motivate <span class="yellow">people</span> such as achievement, recognition, work itself, responsibility, advancement and personal growth were called the "motivators" which lead to feelings of satisfaction. Extrinsic factors such as work conditions, company policies, supervision, interpersonal work relations, salary and job security, known as "hygiene" factors, were claimed to prevent dissatisfaction. "Motivators" directly affect a <span class="yellow">person</span>'s motivational drive to do a good job, therefore they are believed to be more important than hygiene factors.
Mottaz on the other hand, accounted for individual differences in job satisfaction among workers and based his study on two dimensions: "work rewards" and "work values"[26]. "Work rewards" are perceived characteristics of the job and have three conceptual clusters which include task, social and organizational rewards [26]. Mottaz describes "task rewards" (intrinsic) as having five independent characteristics including: skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy and feedback. Examples include interesting and challenging work, self-direction and responsibility, creativity, opportunities to use one's skills and feedback. In the same study, Mottaz stated that "social rewards" (extrinsic) are derived from the interpersonal relationships established with others at work. Having supportive colleagues and supervisors is an example of this dimension. Lastly, "organizational rewards" (extrinsic) are tangible rewards that are provided by the employer/organization to facilitate performance. Such factors include working conditions, pay and fringe benefits, career advancement and security. The second dimension of job satisfaction is based on "work values", which is the importance that individuals place on their work rewards [26]. For example, some rehabilitation therapists may value extrinsic rewards such as pay and benefits as more important than intrinsic factors like clinical autonomy and challenging work. Although the Herzberg and Mottaz conceptual frameworks are organized differently, their job satisfaction variables are very similar (i.e. work conditions, pay, interpersonal relationships, etc.) and they both classify these factors as having intrinsic or extrinsic elements.
Despite the growing body of literature on recruitment and retention factors in various industries, there is a minimal amount of research studying these factors specifically among rehabilitation professionals. One published study however, did look at extrinsic and intrinsic job satisfaction factors on recruitment and retention of rehabilitation professionals (OTs, PTs and SLPs)[32]. Results from this study showed that intrinsic factors such as professional growth and having a work environment in line with personal values are more significant in predicting career satisfaction than extrinsic factors such as pay and continuing education. These same intrinsic factors are also significant in predicting retention in rehabilitation professionals. Another study looking at recruitment and retention of allied health professionals in the rural areas in New South Wales identified that the main reasons why <span class="yellow">people</span> liked working in rural areas were because of the attractive environment and helpful team members[33]. However 82% of employees reported that having their partner move away was the number one reason for leaving a rural job. A similar study was conducted among OTs and PTs in Northwestern Ontario[34]. Findings from this study indicated that factors contributing to initial decision on location of practice include availability of leisure/recreation activities, proximity of family origin and influences of spouse/partners. Study results also showed that the main reasons therapists left their job were to be closer to their family, lack of job opportunity and spousal influence.
Solely understanding factors that influence recruitment and retention decisions is not sufficient in the development of a HHR plan for rehabilitation professionals. In order for the plan to be effective and sustainable in addressing these factors, the most important and feasible workforce strategies needs to be identified.
There have been a number of reports on health <span class="yellow">human</span> resources (HHR) planning, recruitment and retention strategies for physicians [35,36] and nurses [37], however information regarding rehabilitation professionals is lacking. Canadian reports indicate that the main reason for significant gaps in this field is the absence of current and reliable data available on supply, demand and labour force participation trends for rehabilitation therapists [38-40]. There is some research that has investigated theoretical models of job satisfaction on recruitment and retention [28,32]; however few studies have looked at how these models have been implemented. Other studies have examined the relationship of gender, workplace setting (i.e. hospital, ambulatory, rehabilitation, acute and long-term care) and geographical location (i.e. rural or urban) on job satisfaction and retention among rehabilitation professionals [41-43]. Furthermore, no empirical studies have examined conceptual frameworks for organizing recruitment and retention strategies for rehabilitation therapists. To address this gap, this research identified recruitment and retention strategies from the literature for rehabilitation professionals and determined their importance and feasibility using expert panels.<br><br>Methods
Phase 1: Literature Review
Identification of recruitment and retention strategies
A review of the literature was conducted to identify recruitment and retention strategies for rehabilitation therapists. In this study, rehabilitation professionals were defined as physical therapists (PTs), occupational therapists (OTs) and speech-language pathologists (SLPs). Both published and non-empirical literature was accessed in this review. Keywords used to search for relevant published studies in the Consolidated International Nursing and Allied Health Sciences Library (CINAHL) (1982 to 2005) and Medline (1996 to 2005) included: "health <span class="yellow">human</span> resources or health manpower", "rehabilitation or rehabilitation professionals or vocational", "allied health professionals or personnel", "recruitment strategies", "retention strategies", "physical therapist or physiotherapist", "occupational therapy or occupational therapist", "speech-language pathologist or speech-language pathology". Non-empirical literature searches were made on international and national on-line catalogues and publications from health organizations, professional associations, and hospital and home care organizations. International reports were limited to developed countries since the purpose of this study was to identify strategies appropriate to the Ontario setting.<br><br>Organization and consolidation of strategies
There was a paucity of peer-reviewed studies obtained exploring rehabilitation HHR strategies, therefore the majority of strategies were selected from grey literature reports from international, national and provincial health organizations. From the literature review, 107 potential strategies were identified according to their relevance to HHR issues for rehabilitation in Ontario. These strategies were then categorized into two broad groups: A) Recruitment and Retention (n = 73), and B) Education (n = 34). The majority of strategies were not specific to rehabilitation professionals and they were reviewed by a group of three individuals collectively (rehabilitation researcher, manager, and clinician) for duplication, clarity, action focused properties and appropriateness to the Canadian or Ontario setting. When necessary, a small number of strategies were re-worded to be relevant to a rehabilitation context. This analysis resulted in the selection of 40 Recruitment and Retention and 24 Education strategies. Only 14 recruitment and retention and six education strategies were obtained from peer-reviewed articles. Since the majority of strategies were identified from the grey literature, it was not surprising that there was no apriori peer-reviewed conceptual framework that reflected the breadth of the strategies obtained from the literature review. As a result, the themes used by the Health and Community Services <span class="yellow">Human</span> Resources Sector Study in Newfoundland and Labrador [44] formed the basis for the organizational framework for this study since they aligned with the identified strategies. Each group was further categorized into the five themes (three for Recruitment and Retention and two for Education). The three Recruitment and Retention strategy themes were: (1) Quality of Worklife and Work Environment [n = 19]; (2) Workload and Skill Mix [n = 6]; and (3) Financial Incentives and Marketing [n = 15]. The two Education strategy themes were: (1) Education and Training [n = 11] and (2) Professional Development (n = 13).<br><br>
Phase 2: Expert Panel
<span class="yellow">Participant</span> Selection
Once this study was approved by the Research Ethics Board at the University of Toronto, key informants who participated in a previous study regarding rehabilitation supply and demand at the University of Toronto [21] were asked to nominate potential <span class="yellow">participants</span> for the panels. The selection criteria considered were acknowledged leadership in the panel member's specialty, expertise in recruitment and retention or education and training of rehabilitation professionals. Absence of conflicts of interest, geographic diversity, and diversity of practice setting were also considered. After purposefully selecting the initial list of candidates from among the nominations, each nominee was contacted to establish their interest and availability. Those who expressed an interest in participating were asked to send their curriculum vitae to help the research team evaluate their contributions to their field of expertise. Once candidate panelists were selected, each received a letter explaining the expert panel process and consent form. Two separate panels were constructed: one for Recruitment and Retention (n = 8) and the other for Education (n = 9) (Table 1). The size of the panel was large enough to permit diversity of representation while still being small enough to allow all <span class="yellow">participants</span> to be involved in the group discussion [45].<br><br>Expert Panel Process: Round 1 Survey
A modified-delphi technique was then used for the expert panel process, [46,47] based on the RAND/UCLA appropriateness method [45]. In round 1, members of the Recruitment and Retention panel were sent an electronic survey containing the 40 strategies identified from the literature review and the Education panelists were also sent an electronic survey with 24 strategies. For Round 1, each panel was asked to rate the strategies using a nine-point Likert-type rating scale that ranged from "none" (1) to "maximum" (9), on two key dimensions: Feasibility and Importance. Feasibility was defined as the practicality and cost implications of the strategy and was rated from the respondents' perspective. Importance was defined as how valuable, appropriate and useful the strategy could be for rehabilitation HHR planning in Ontario. At the end of the survey, panelists were given the opportunity to suggest additional strategies that they felt were appropriate to consider. Once completed, panelists were asked to return the survey to the study office by email or fax prior to the expert panel meeting in Round 2. Data from each questionnaire were entered into a spreadsheet and tabulated. Descriptive statistics were calculated for each strategy using frequency distributions and proportional percentages of respondents. Importance and feasibility rankings were based on the percentage of expert panelists' low, medium and high ratings.<br><br>Expert Panel Process Round 2: Expert Panel one-day meeting
After the independent completion of the survey, each panel was convened separately for a one-day meeting for final discussions, debates and consensus voting to decide on strategies [48]. A strategy that had been scored 7, 8 or 9 for both feasibility and importance by two-thirds of the panel was considered a high rating. Strategies that had a combination of medium and high scores between 4 and 9 in either of the two dimensions were considered medium rated strategies, while low rated strategies had scores between 1 and 3 for both dimensions.
On the day of the meeting, the panelists were given a copy of the aggregated survey results indicating the ratings of all of the strategies. High and low rated strategies were not discussed as there was already consensus, whereas all medium rated strategies were subject to discussion. Using a nominal group process [47], each strategy was discussed in turn, and panelists were given an opportunity to raise any issues or concerns regarding the clarity and wording of each strategy. Each of the strategies discussed were then individually rated a second time by each panelist in an attempt to reach further consensus.<br><br><br><br>Results
Selection of strategies for Round 1: Modified Delphi process
Following Round 1 rating of the 40 identified strategies, the Recruitment and Retention panel reached consensus on 12 strategies. However, 14 had a combination of high/medium importance and feasibility ratings and 14 had medium ratings on both dimensions, therefore it required further discussion. An additional strategy regarding family relocation programs was added by this panel.
The Education Panel ranked 16 of 24 strategies with high importance and feasibility after Round 1. Since there were only eight strategies with medium ratings, this expert panel decided to review all the strategies at the face-to-face meeting to discuss the rationale that would explain why some of the highly rated strategies were not already implemented and to come to a consensus on the other eight medium rated strategies. They also added an additional strategy for career paths.<br><br>Selection of strategies for Round 2: Face-to-face meeting
A total of 34 strategies were identified by both the Recruitment and Retention and Education expert panels as being important and feasible for the development of a HHR plan for recruitment and retention of rehabilitation professionals. Under the Recruitment and Retention theme, seven were categorized as Quality of Worklife and Work Environment; two were Workload and Skill Mix, and another seven were Financial Incentives and Marketing. As for the Education panel, five were categorized as Education and Training strategies while the other thirteen were related to Professional Development.
As indicated in Table 2, at the end of the second round of voting, the Recruitment and Retention panel had a total of 16 highly important and feasible strategies, 8 high/medium importance and feasibility, 8 medium and 9 low ratings for both dimensions. The Education panel on the other hand had a total of 18 high, 1 high/medium, 3 medium and 3 low rating strategies.<br><br>Recruitment and Retention Strategy Rankings
Table 3 provides a detailed description and ranking of each of the recruitment and retention strategies that were rated highly important and feasible. The importance and feasibility rankings were based on the largest proportion of panel members rating a strategy a 7, 8 or 9. The overall combined ranking was based on the average of the proportion of these two dimensions. Among these selected strategies, the majority were classified under Quality of Worklife and Work Environment (44%) and Financial Incentives and Marketing (44%), followed by Workload and Skill Mix (12%). It should be noted that some strategies had equal rankings; therefore the total number of rankings did not equal the total number of strategies.
Recruitment and retention strategies that had a combination of high and medium ratings in either of the two dimensions included: sense of empowerment in promoting healthy work environments; team-building exercises; developing participatory decision-making systems; improving rural working conditions; recognizing work-life balance; creating an environment where staff are valued; optimizing scope of practice and work-management autonomy. Strategies that had medium importance and feasibility ratings included: resolving concerns about liability and accountability in collaborative practice; recruiting international trained therapists; opportunity to work in different settings; interprofessional payment schemes; family leave; staff recognition and creating a position for a provincial health professional recruiter. Low importance and feasibility strategies included: word of mouth references; bursaries and retention bonuses; exchange employment opportunities; health promotion; retention workshop; 80–20 staffing model (80% clinical and 20% learning new skills or training others); using recruitment agencies and providing recruitment bonuses (Table 4).<br><br>Education Strategy Rankings
Education strategies that were rated highly important and feasible are described in Table 5. The majority of strategies in this group tend to be in the area of Professional Development (72%), more so than Education and Training (28%).
The medium rated education strategies included: expand interprofessional education; provide incentives for students interested in rural practice; summer mentorship programs for high school students; and aboriginal student support program. The strategies that were considered neither feasible nor important included: using return of service contracts after professional development; create a tiered pathway approach through modular education and laddered credentialing and in accreditation standards allow greater use of rural practice sites (Table 6).
Since the purpose of the panel was to identify recruitment and retention and education strategies that could inform the development of a HHR plan for rehabilitation professionals, there was also discussion about contextual factors that would influence a plan. Panelists commented that key factors to consider prior to implementation of these strategies should include workplace setting, geographical location (i.e. urban and rural) and gender issues.<br><br>
Discussion
The purpose of this study was to identify recruitment and retention strategies to inform the development of HHR planning for rehabilitation professionals in Ontario. This study highlights that Quality of Worklife and Work Environment, Financial Incentives and Marketing and Professional Development are the three major areas of focus when developing a competitive HR plan in the rehabilitation sector.
Quality of Worklife and Work Environment
Quality of Worklife and Work Environment strategies ranked among the top category for recruitment and retention of rehabilitation therapists. This has also been found among nurses [44] where it was reported that addressing such factors can affect the overall success of the program [49]. Specifically, our findings showed that the top ranked strategy for both importance and feasibility was improving and maintaining the safety of rehabilitation professionals in the workplace. Specific strategies that could reduce aggression, abuse and violence in the workplace include: zero tolerance policies, access to employee support programs and providing assistance to rehabilitation professionals who work alone (i.e. home care and rural and remote areas). Since there is less control over the environment in the home care setting, safety may become a greater concern in one practice setting over another. This might suggest that because there is less control in environments such as home care, remote areas, and psychiatric settings, maintaining safety will be more difficult and that solutions will need to be tailored to these settings in order to ensure retention of providers. Although no studies have looked at implementing personal safety strategies for home care therapists, written policies and procedures for home care nurses during inclement weather and for dealing with abusive or dangerous <span class="yellow">patients</span>, families and neighbourhoods have been reported [50].
In addition to the above, ensuring open and timely communication between employer and worker was also ranked highly among the recruitment and retention strategies. Examples of strategies include: open door policies, employee advisory committees and regular staff meetings and evaluations. Although these strategies were reported to be used among organizations providing services to <span class="yellow">persons</span> with developmental disabilities in Alberta, there was no description of the organizations, sample size or methodology [51]. Similar findings were found in a qualitative study among 16 nurses working from diverse practice settings (acute, long-term care, rehabilitation and community; from both urban and rural areas) in a health region in western Canada. From the semi-structured interviews, study <span class="yellow">participants</span> expressed a desire for improved consultation and communication with nurses regarding changes to the health care system [52].<br><br>Financial Incentives and Marketing
Another area that was ranked highly was marketing strategies to increase high school student and public awareness of rehabilitation careers. These specific strategies were also recommended by the Ontario Hospital Association (OHA) in order to establish a competitive position for Ontario hospitals in respect of recruitment and retention of health care professionals [53]. Similar strategies have been developed by the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) in response to the declining number of students applying to Physical Therapy Education Programs [54]. To address this trend, APTA developed a campaign to promote Physical Therapy as the profession of choice to high school and college students across the United States. The potential components of their plan included: developing a "Recruiting Kit" for educators, students and various APTA members to be used in the high school and college settings to introduce Physical Therapy as a career; establishing public relations initiatives that demonstrate the role of Physical Therapy in the public arena targeting minority groups that are underrepresented in the profession; and creating alliances with professional associations of high school guidance counsellors and educators. Based on our finding, the APTA model may have applicability in Ontario.<br><br>Workload and Skill Mix
Of the six Workload and Skill Mix strategies only two were highly rated: implementing a caseload management database and using support personnel. Caseload management has been identified in the literature as an issue affecting all three rehabilitation professions. For example, in physiotherapy, Christie's study [55] found that caseload expectations tended to be significantly higher than the reality and that caseload varies across different programs. Similarly, the Canadian Association of Speech-Language Pathologists and Audiologists (CASPLA) survey indicated that factors affecting the workload of SLPs include delivery models, client disorder, severity and work setting [56]. A literature review and environmental scan undertaken by the Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists (CAOT) proposed that guiding principles for caseload management should include: evidence-based occupational therapy, cost-effectiveness, accountability, professional leadership and expert judgment, comprehensiveness and flexibility [57]. Therefore, upon implementation of a caseload management database for rehabilitation, key factors to consider include workplace setting and client service delivery models.
The other highly rated Workload and Skill Mix strategy was the use of support personnel (i.e. physiotherapy assistants or exercise therapists) to increase efficiency of utilization of scarcer and higher order rehabilitation competencies. Considerations for implementing this strategy include addressing key issues such supply, standards of education, standards of practice and accreditation. These are highlighted in an article by Salvatori [58] who reported that the actual number of OT personnel delivering OT services in Canada remains unknown and that there are no national standards of education nor accreditation process for OT assistants. CAOT believes that in order to utilize support personnel appropriately, studies on <span class="yellow">human</span> resource needs for occupational therapy and support personnel are first needed with input from OTs, stakeholders, funders, decision makers and health policy planners [59]. Since there is a lack of competency profiles related to the role, responsibilities, and supervision of assistants, particularly with regards to delivering services in unsupervised community-based settings, the type of workplace setting where this strategy may be implemented should be considered [58].<br><br>Education and Training
Given that 60% of highly rated Education and Training strategies targeted rural and remote practices underscores the importance of specific strategies for rural and remote areas in the development of a HHR plan. The need to build on existing mechanisms to expand the availability of rural and remote clinical placements by providing financial and accommodation support was ranked among the top two most important and feasible education strategies for rehabilitation professionals. Not only has this strategy been used as a recruitment tool for rehabilitation students, it has also been reported by Solomon et al. [34] to be effective in retaining OTs and PTs in underserviced Northwestern Ontario communities. Respondents from Solomon et al.'s study reported that the top three benefits of supervising students were that it stimulates thinking, it provides opportunity to contribute to the profession and that it provides access to current information. The reported disadvantages however was that it was time-consuming and students contributed stress to the working environment. Similarly, a two-part study found substantial gaps between financial incentives students deem important in the creation of an appealing clinical placement opportunity and the actual provisions offered to them by Southeastern Ontario communities [60,61]. Although OT and PT students reported that they were more willing to complete a clinical placement in an underserviced community if provided travel stipends, rent-free housing and interprofessional education opportunities, the majority of these incentives were only available to medical students. In addition to training students for rural and remote practice, a longitudinal study reported that perceived opportunity for career development was the most significant factor related to job turnover and regional attrition among physiotherapists working in Northern Ontario [5]. Therefore developing workforce strategies for rehabilitation therapists working in these areas should be among one of the priority areas in HHR planning.<br><br>Professional Development
Our findings indicate that the theme with the largest number of strategies that were considered important and feasible to implement as part of HHR planning was professional development. Many were specific to rural and remote areas. Although the importance of continuous professional development (CPD) in recruitment and retention is well recognized, a Canadian study reported several barriers to its implementation [62]. In the case of OTs employed in public settings in Nova Scotia, Townsend et al. (2006) found that the most powerful deterrent for CPD was the lack of support from workplace policies. Based on their study results, the use of CPD as a recruitment and retention strategy was highly influenced by gender issues, work-life balance, career advancement, working conditions, geographical location, professional versus employer responsibility, and employee benefits. Although occupational therapy is a female-dominated profession, workplace policies did not address issues of gender. For example, therapists in this study indicated that CPD competes with family commitments, therefore these activities are "done largely during personal time, mainly at their own cost, and on top of childcare, eldercare, homemaking and other family responsibilities" [62]. In addition, heavy workloads, lack of salary and career incentives, and lack of policy and funding support are all barriers to CPD. These issues become more pronounced in rural and remote settings because smaller communities often only have one therapist; hence the systemic pressure of workload demands makes it difficult for the therapist to leave <span class="blue">patient</span> care. OTs from this study also questioned who was responsible for CPD. Some felt that it was the professional's responsibility while others felt that it was the responsibility of the employer to provide CPD opportunities. The primary limitation employers faced was the lack of financial resources, however giving employees time off without pay was an alternative strategy utilized instead of funding professional development activities. Although there are professional and provincial variations in funding for CPD across Canada, these results are informative in that it highlights the need for employers to consider how workplace policies can affect recruitment and retention strategies.
Limitations of this study should be noted. First, the majority of the strategies were obtained from the grey literature that is not subject to the same scrutiny as the peer-reviewed literature. Second, almost none of the strategies were specifically developed for rehabilitation professionals and in many cases had to be re-worded to fit the rehabilitation context. There is a lack of research on rehabilitation clinicians' perspectives on recruitment and retention strategies; therefore future research should focus on investigating this area. Third, during the face-to-face meeting, bias could have resulted from panelists whose opinion may have influenced others significantly, especially if members came from similar workplace settings. The facilitator of the expert panels however, followed a strict process for managing the discussion and ensured that all panelists were given the opportunity to express their opinions.
Finally, although some strategies such as competitive wage packages, training/growth opportunities and professional development are viewed as both a recruitment and retention incentive, other strategies do not overlap and are appropriate for only one of the two tasks. For example, increasing public awareness of rehabilitation careers, providing rural and remote orientation packages and family relocation programs are only appropriate for attracting a worker while ensuring open and timely communication may be seen as a strategy only for retention. Future research should therefore consider studying recruitment and retention strategies separately so that a distinction between the two can be made.<br><br>
Conclusion
This study identified 34 strategies that should be considered as important and feasible for implementation as part of HHR planning for rehabilitation professionals. Although the highest ranked strategies focused on areas of Quality of Worklife and Work Environment, Financial Incentives and Marketing and Professional Development, key factors that need to be considered in the context of implementation include: workplace setting, geographical location and gender issues. While this is the first study to our knowledge that provides a comprehensive list of recruitment and retention strategies relevant to rehabilitation professionals, more information is needed for the development of a HHR plan. Information on trends in labour force participation as well as knowledge regarding the use and effectiveness of recruitment and retention strategies for rehabilitation professionals is needed. More importantly, the success of implementing and sustaining such strategies requires future research to validate these strategies from the perspective of rehabilitation clinicians and <span class="yellow">human</span> resource decisions makers (i.e. local government, stakeholders, etc.) so that specific barriers and challenges can be identified.<br><br>Competing interests

Abstract
Background
A 32-year-old Caucasian primigravida was admitted for elective Caesarean Section at 36 weeks and 6 days with the diagnosis of preeclampsia.<br><br>Case presentation
Traction of the umbilical cord after delivery of a healthy baby resulted in uterine inversion. The placenta was found to be densely adherent to the posterior uterine wall. Piecemeal excision of the placenta as close as possible to the uterine lining was then performed.<br><br>Conclusion
In this way we were able to control a massive post partum hemorrhage and preserve the fertility of the <span class="blue">patient</span>.<br><br><br><br>Background
Placenta accreta is defined as abnormal adherence, either in whole or in part of the afterbirth to the underlying uterine wall. Placenta accreta and other pathological placentations (such as increta, percreta) are rare complications of pregnancy with potential life threatening and fertility threatening consequences. The incidence of placenta accreta has increased ten times over the last fifteen years, which reflects the increase in the rate of Caesarean Sections (CS) [1]. Placenta accreta has become the most important cause of peripartum hysterectomy. A life threatening acute uterine inversion and massive PPH can be caused by placenta accreta during CS but seldom in a primigravida (Figure 1).<br><br>Case presentation
A 32 year old, primigravida, was admitted in a District General Hospital for elective Caesarean section at 36 weeks and 6 days with the diagnosis of preeclampsia. She had two antenatal ultrasound examinations showing a healthy fetus and posterior fundal placenta.
The <span class="blue">patient</span> had lower segment CS of a healthy male <span class="yellow">infant</span> under spinal anesthesia. The placenta was found to be densely adherent to the posterior uterine wall. Traction of the umbilical cord was applied and subsequently resulted in uterine inversion.
The placenta was removed by 'piecemeal' excising as close as possible to the uterine lining. About 80% of the placental tissue was removed until the uterine inversion was corrected. The uterus was closed in two layers. Two intra-abdominal drains were sited. The estimated blood loss was 2.5 litres and five units of blood were transfused together with 2 units of FFP during intra-operative and post-operative period. In addition, the <span class="blue">patient</span> was treated with intravenous oxytocin infusion, pr misoprostol and antibiotics.
On the second post partum day, vaginal Doppler ultrasound scan showed significant amount of placental tissues with increased vascularity measuring 2.7 × 6.6 × 6.8 cms within the endometrial cavity (Figure 2).
The <span class="blue">patient</span> was discharged on the fifth post-operative day with a conservative management. A follow up Ultrasound scan after two weeks showed reduction of placental mass (Figure 3). In addition, there was significant decrease in serum beta HCG levels from 2300 u/L on day 1 to 13 u/L at four weeks post operatively. The <span class="blue">patient</span> remained with minimal vaginal bleeding without abdominal pain. She had two normal periods after stopping breastfeeding and was feeling well. She was discharged from the early pregnancy unit.<br><br>Discussion
A life-threatening uterine inversion can be rarely caused by placenta accreta [2]. Placenta accreta classically presents with retained placenta and hemorrhage. The association between uterine inversion and placenta accreta is unclear, however, strong traction on the umbilical cord with fundal placenta, excessive fundal pressure, relaxed uterus, short umbilical cord, uterine anomalies and antepartum use of magnesium sulphate are known associated factors [2]. Uterine inversion and retain placenta accreta can both be fatal complications [3].
In the case described the placenta accreta was complicated by uterine inversion and subsequent massive post partum hemorrhage, significantly increasing the risk of maternal mortality. Massive post partum hemorrhage is a major cause of maternal mortality in the United Kingdom (why <span class="yellow">women</span> die latest report) [4].
In this case, the placenta was clamped as close to the uterine cavity as possible and cut. The base of the placenta was overrun with haemostatic sutures and this was repeated until as much of the placenta as possible was removed (Figure 4). Placental removal enabled correction of uterine inversion.
Despite the many conditions associated with uterine inversion risk assessment is often lacking making the condition usually unexpected at the time of presentation. The association between abnormal placentation such as placenta accreta and uterine inversion is well supported [2]. Therefore, we advocate antenatal evaluation and risk assessment for placenta accreta [5]. Prenatal Ultrasound reported sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 79% for placenta accreta, but offer no more than provisional diagnostic probability statement [6]. Moreover, because 45% of placenta accreta cases were not detected by ultrasound, it is important to consider avoiding manual removal of placenta if there were intraoperative signs of accreta [6]. If clinically or sonographically the <span class="blue">patient</span> is suspected antenatally to be at risk of placenta accreta, appropriate management options should be considered, such as attempted conservative management or hysterectomy and counseling provided about potential sequelae [6]. The traditional management is abdominal hysterectomy, but this operation terminates fertility and may have devastating psychological effects. However, in correct circumstances, a conservative approach may be suitable. Conservative management of abnormally invasive placentation can be effective and fertility can be preserved. It should be only considered in highly selected cases when blood loss is minimal and there is wish for fertility preservation [7].
For <span class="yellow">women</span> who want to preserve their fertility the placenta should be left intact if possible after caesarean delivery as this approach lowers the risk of subsequent hysterectomy from 85% to 15%. For <span class="yellow">women</span> who have completed their family, hysterectomy with placenta left in situ is preferable to lower the maternal morbidity rates [6].
This case report involved conservative management. Peripartum hysterectomy was avoided and the aim was to preserve fertility. Prophylactic antibiotics, post partum oxytocics and the use of misoprostol post operatively helped to prevent further post partum hemorrhage.
When a <span class="blue">patient</span> isinitially opted for conservative management, the possibility of recurrence should be discussed [8]. Furthermore, placentation should be carefully monitored for recurrence in any subsequent pregnancy, particularly if the placenta is located at the same site as the previous placenta accreta.
Conservative treatment for placenta accreta may be an alternative procedure in some selected cases.<br><br>Conclusion
We suggest an alternative approach for managing uterine inversion caused by placenta accreta that involved conservative management. This way hysterectomy was avoided and fertility was preserved.<br><br>Abbreviations

<h3>pmcA553979</h3>Medicinal herb use among asthmatic <span class="yellow">patients</span> attending a specialty care facility in Trinidad
Abstract
Background
There is an increasing prevalence of asthma in the Caribbean and <span class="yellow">patients</span> remain non-compliant to therapy despite the development of guidelines for management and prevention. Some <span class="yellow">patients</span> may self-medicate with medicinal herbs for symptomatic relief, as there is a long tradition of use for a variety of ailments. The study assessed the prevalence of use and the factors affecting the decision to use herbs in asthmatic <span class="yellow">patients</span> attending a public specialty care clinic in Trinidad.<br><br>Methods
A descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted at the Chest Clinic in Trinidad using a de novo, pilot-tested, researcher-administered questionnaire between June and July 2003.<br><br>Results
Fifty-eight out of 191 <span class="yellow">patients</span> (30.4%) reported using herbal remedies for symptomatic relief. Gender, age, ethnicity, and asthma severity did not influence the decision to use herbs; however, 62.5% of <span class="yellow">patients</span> with tertiary level schooling used herbs, p = 0.025. Thirty-four of these 58 <span class="yellow">patients</span> (58.6%) obtained herbs from their backyards or the supermarket; only 14 <span class="yellow">patients</span> (24.1%) obtained herbs from an herbalist, herbal shop or pharmacy. Relatives and friends were the sole source of information for most <span class="yellow">patients</span> (70.7%), and only 10.3% consulted an herbalist. <span class="yellow">Ginger</span>, <span class="yellow">garlic</span>, aloes, <span class="yellow">shandileer</span>, wild <span class="yellow">onion</span>, pepper and <span class="yellow">black sage</span> were the most commonly used herbs.<br><br>Conclusions
Among <span class="yellow">patients</span> attending the Chest Clinic in Trinidad the use of herbal remedies in asthma is relatively common on the advice of relatives and friends. It is therefore becoming imperative for healthcare providers to become more knowledgeable on this modality and to keep abreast with the latest developments.<br><br><br><br>Background
Recent reports from the Caribbean suggest that the incidence of asthma is following the global trend of increasing prevalence. In Jamaica, a prevalence of 20.8% for exercise-induced asthma was estimated in a cross-sectional study in <span class="yellow">schoolchildren</span> [1]. About one in ten <span class="yellow">patients</span> attending an Accident and Emergency Department in Trinidad were treated for acute severe asthma [2] and over 15,000 <span class="yellow">patients</span> attended four A&E departments throughout the island over a 12-month period [3].
Inhaled corticosteroids as prophylaxis and 'as required' bronchodilator for symptomatic relief are established modalities for asthma management and prevention and the Commonwealth Caribbean Medical Research Council/Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines were adopted in the Caribbean in 1997 [4]. It has been noted that inefficient management predisposes <span class="yellow">patients</span> to frequent hospitalization and reduced quality of life. In Trinidad, non-compliance and inadequate inhaler technique negatively impact on effective disease management [5,6]. The frequent unavailability of medication at public health facilities and the prohibitive cost at private pharmacies are significantly associated with non-compliance and consequently poor disease control. In these studies, some <span class="yellow">patients</span> indicated their use of herbal remedies as an alternative to conventional medicines.
Over the last few decades, a global resurgence in the use of herbal remedies has fuelled the growing multi-billion dollar international trade of botanical products. Many <span class="yellow">patients</span>, dissatisfied with conventional medicines because they expect permanent cures, believe that herbal remedies are 'natural' and sometimes self-medicate without informing their attending physician.
Although there is a long history of traditional use of medicinal herbs throughout the Caribbean [7,8] few studies were done to assess the prevalence of use. Surveys in Jamaica reported an almost 100% use of herbal teas and remedies by respondents throughout the island [9] and 71% in paediatrics inpatients at the University Hospital [10]. These studies, however, assessed only the lifetime use of medicinal herbs and did not identify their use for any particular disease. In Trinidad and Tobago, the use of 'bush medicine' in diabetic <span class="yellow">patients</span> attending primary healthcare facilities throughout the island was assessed and although 42% reportedly used herbs, only 24% used this healthcare modality for self-management of diabetes [11]. Another survey conducted at an outpatient surgical facility in Trinidad indicated a lifetime prevalence of 86% among <span class="yellow">patients</span> [12] for any healthcare issue.
This study was undertaken to assess the extent of use of herbal remedies by asthmatic <span class="yellow">patients</span> attending a specialty chest clinic in Trinidad for symptomatic relief and to determine the factors influencing the <span class="blue">patient</span>'s decision to use herbs.<br><br>Methods
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of the West Indies, St. Augustine campus and permission to interview <span class="yellow">patients</span> was granted by the Director of the Chest Clinic of the Ministry of Health, Trinidad and Tobago. The study was conducted over the two-month period June to July 2003.
Sample and setting
The Chest Clinic was chosen as the source of subjects as this is the only national tertiary level health facility specializing in the management of respiratory diseases. <span class="yellow">Patients</span> entering the study were physician-diagnosed asthmatics based on self-reporting symptoms of wheezing, chest tightness and nocturnal coughing in the previous year. <span class="yellow">Patients</span> were recruited by consecutive sampling and the nature and purpose of the study were explained on an individual basis. Those confirming their willingness to participate signed their informed consent and were interviewed using a de novo, pilot-tested, researcher-administered questionnaire.<br><br>Interview instrument
The questionnaire assessed demographic data such as age, gender, ethnicity, residential district, education, employment and socioeconomic status. Subjects reported their disease severity as intermittent, moderate or severe as determined by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines with respect to symptom frequency [4]. <span class="yellow">Patients</span> also reported their use of herbal remedies, identified the herbs used, the frequency of use, source of herbal medicines and the reasons for the use of herbs.<br><br>Statistical analysis
The sample size was calculated as 185 <span class="yellow">patients</span> assuming a prevalence of 86% [13] with a confidence level of 95%. Since all variables were categorical, χ2 tests were performed to determine whether there were statistically significant associations between the use of herbs and these variables. The p value was set at <0.05 for statistical significance. The data was analyzed using SPSS for Windows (Version 9.0, Chicago, IL).<br><br>
Results
Demography
During the study period one hundred and ninety one <span class="yellow">patients</span> consented to participate. The demographic details of the sample are given in Table 1. <span class="yellow">Patients</span> between 35 and 64 years of age formed the largest portion of the sample (62.3%). There was a significant gender difference with females outnumbering males by a 2:1 ratio, p < 0.01. Most <span class="yellow">patients</span> were of Asian Indian origin (58.1%) and resided in suburban areas (60.2%). There was a high level of unemployment (30.4%); this could be correlated to primary schooling (seven or less years of formal education) being the highest educational level attained in 52.9% and no formal schooling in 5.2% of the sample population. Income was low, with 42.9% of the sample population earning below US$4,000 per year.<br><br>Antiasthmatic drug use
The GINA guidelines were recently adopted in the Caribbean and asthmatic <span class="yellow">patients</span> are currently treated according to their symptom severity. In our sample population, particularly in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with moderate and severe symptoms, corticosteroids (controllers) and β2-agonists (relievers) were prescribed at very high rates, Table 2. Almost 90% of all <span class="yellow">patients</span> with moderate symptoms were prescribed drugs in these classes. Almost all <span class="yellow">patients</span> with severe symptoms were prescribed β2-agonists. This high level of prescription and use of β2-agonists suggest a lack of symptomatic control in our sample population. Theophylline and anticholinergics were prescribed in both categories of <span class="yellow">patients</span>, but to a lesser extent.<br><br>Factors influencing the use of herbal remedies
Gender, age, ethnicity, residential district, employment status, income and asthma severity had no statistically significant effect on the use of herbal remedies within the sample population, Table 3. However, almost two-thirds (62.5%) of <span class="yellow">patients</span> with tertiary education used herbal remedies for asthma, p = 0.025.<br><br>Characteristics of <span class="yellow">patients</span> using herbal remedies
Most <span class="yellow">patients</span> (70.7%) using herbs were advised by a relative or friend and only 10.3% sought the advice of an herbalist, Table 4. A cultural/traditional basis was the reason for herbal remedy usage in twenty-one (36.2%) <span class="yellow">patients</span> and another twelve (20.7%) <span class="yellow">patients</span> used herbs because they felt that were either 'natural' or 'healthy'. Twelve (20.7%) <span class="yellow">patients</span> used herbs because they believed that their physician-prescribed allopathic medicines were not working.
Most <span class="yellow">patients</span> (58.6%) obtained their herbs or medicinal plants from either their backyards or the supermarket. Only fourteen (24.1%) obtained their herbal supplies from an herbalist, herbal shop or pharmacy. Seventeen (29.3%) of these <span class="yellow">patients</span> reported using herbs within the last week and most these <span class="yellow">patients</span> (60.3%) used herbs within the last six months.
Many of these <span class="yellow">patients</span> were using both physician-prescribed antiasthmatic drugs and herbal remedies, Table 5. No <span class="blue">patient</span> with either moderate or severe symptoms indicated that herbal remedies alone were sufficient to relieve symptomatic episodes. It is interesting to note that most <span class="yellow">patients</span> with moderate symptoms (57.1%) believed that concurrent use of conventional medications and herbs gave better symptomatic relieve. One the other hand, most <span class="yellow">patients</span> with severe symptoms (53.8%) believed that physician-prescribed medications worked better than herbal remedies, while 23.1% believed that neither relieved their symptoms.<br><br>Herbs used in asthma
Most <span class="yellow">patients</span> in the sample used more than one medicinal herb simultaneously, which were usually prepared and administered as mixtures in teas. Almost one in four <span class="yellow">patients</span> using medicinal herbs (22.5%) used either <span class="yellow">garlic</span> (<span class="yellow">Allium sativum</span>) or <span class="yellow">ginger</span> (<span class="yellow">Zingiber officinale</span>) for symptomatic relief of asthma, Table 6. Aloes (<span class="yellow">Aloe vera</span>) <span class="yellow">shandileer</span> (<span class="yellow">Leonotis nepetifolia</span>), wild <span class="yellow">onion</span> (<span class="yellow">Hymenocallis tubiflora</span>), pepper (Capsicum spp.) <span class="yellow">tulsi</span> (<span class="yellow">Ocimum gratissimum</span>), <span class="yellow">black sage</span> (<span class="yellow">Cordia curassavica</span>), <span class="yellow">shadon beni</span> (<span class="yellow">Eryngium foetidium</span>), <span class="yellow">lemongrass</span> (<span class="yellow">Cymbopogon citratus</span>) and <span class="yellow">nutmeg</span> (<span class="yellow">Myristica fragrans</span>) were the more popular traditional indigenous West Indian medicinal plants used. Two <span class="yellow">patients</span> reported using marijuana (leaves and roots). Herbs of European and North American origin, identified as <span class="yellow">Echinacea</span> (<span class="yellow">Echinacea purpurea</span>), <span class="yellow">Golden Seal</span> (<span class="yellow">Hydrastis canadensis</span>) and <span class="yellow">Chamomile</span> (<span class="yellow">Matricaria chamomilla</span>) were less frequently used. Five <span class="yellow">patients</span> reported using trade name imported tablets for asthma.<br><br>Effect of income and education on the use of herbs
<span class="yellow">Patients</span> using easily accessible herbs such as <span class="yellow">ginger</span> (<span class="yellow">Zingiber officinale</span>) and aloes (<span class="yellow">Aloe vera</span>), and traditional indigenous medicinal herbs such as <span class="yellow">shandileer</span> (<span class="yellow">Leonotis nepetifolia</span>) and <span class="yellow">tulsi</span> (<span class="yellow">Ocimum gratissimum</span>) were more likely to be earning less than US$12,000, Table 7. Herbs of European or North American origin (<span class="yellow">Echinacea purpurea</span> and <span class="yellow">Matricaria chamomilla</span>) were more likely to be used by <span class="yellow">patients</span> earning in excess of US$12,000 per annum. Income did not affect the use of either <span class="yellow">garlic</span> or cocoa <span class="yellow">onion</span>.
Aloes (<span class="yellow">Aloe vera</span>), <span class="yellow">tulsi</span> (<span class="yellow">Ocimum gratissimum</span>) and golden seal were preferred in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with at least twelve years of formal education, Table 7. <span class="yellow">Garlic</span> and <span class="yellow">Echinacea</span> were the preferred herbal medicines in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with more than twelve years formal education. Educational level did not affect the <span class="yellow">patients</span>' decision to use <span class="yellow">shandileer</span> (<span class="yellow">Leonotis nepetifolia</span>), wild <span class="yellow">onion</span> (<span class="yellow">Hymenocallis tubiflora</span>) or <span class="yellow">ginger</span> (<span class="yellow">Zingibe officinale</span>).<br><br>
Discussion
This is the first study of its kind in the Caribbean to assess the use of medicinal herbs by asthmatic <span class="yellow">patients</span> attending a specialty care clinic. The findings of this study are instructive as the use of medicinal herbs for self-medication in disease management has far reaching implications on the quality of healthcare delivery [14]. We report a prevalence of 30.4% in our <span class="blue">patient</span> sample, which is significantly higher than that in the UK, Denmark, Singapore and in the US [15-18].
Most <span class="yellow">patients</span> using medicinal herbs relied on the advice of relatives and friends as their sole source of information, as were caregivers of <span class="yellow">children</span> in a US study [19]. We suggest that this information on the use of medicinal plants could have come from traditional/cultural knowledge, anecdotal evidence or from the greater public awareness through information networks such as the internet on the potential medicinal benefits of herbs. Asthma is an emerging chronic disease in the Caribbean and we suggest that the traditional knowledge in this area may be relatively 'new' and exist in relation to other diseases affecting the respiratory tract, such as cough, the common cold and the flu. This may be one of the reasons for the low prevalence of use of herbs in elderly asthmatic <span class="yellow">patients</span>, as a strong traditional knowledge may not have existed.
We expected a higher prevalence of herbal use in individuals living in rural areas as these districts are depots for traditional knowledge as was reported in Jamaica where rural respondents used a larger variety of herbs than those living in urban areas [10]. As suggested earlier, we suspect that due to the recent emergence of asthma as a chronic disease in the Caribbean it is reasonable to expect that traditional knowledge in the management of this disease is not strong and our results are indicative of this.
We suspected that employment status could have predicted the use of herbs, however, this was not the case in our study sample. Unemployed <span class="yellow">patients</span> did not improvise more in their use of herbal remedies than those in other income groups, even though most of the herbs used were relatively common, readily available and cheap. The low socioeconomic status of the majority of the sample may have prohibited both consultation with qualified herbalists and the purchase of imported, processed herbs that would have incurred additional out-of-pocket expense to the <span class="blue">patient</span>. What we noted was that there was no difference in the use of herbs across the income ranges and that in fact, <span class="yellow">patients</span> earning relatively modest annual incomes between $US12,000 and $US19,999 were most likely to use herbs, although this did not reach statistical significance.
Attaining a higher education positively influence the decision to use herbs. We suggest that in the absence of traditional knowledge regarding the medicinal use of herbs for asthma, a higher educational level may predispose an individual to greater access to general knowledge, especially with greater exposure to the internet and other sources of information, and this could be a factor in positively influencing the individual's decision to use medicinal herbs. The availability of scientific evidence-based information on the efficacy of herbs for diverse healthcare problems may be particularly significant in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with the resources to avail themselves to such information, particularly those with higher educational and income levels. This is particularly true for <span class="yellow">garlic</span> and <span class="yellow">Echinacea</span>, which have been extensively researched and furthermore <span class="yellow">patients</span> with higher educational and income levels would be more likely be at an advantage to access information via literature or on the world wide web regarding the use of these medicinal plants.
<span class="yellow">Patients</span> using imported, processed, and obviously more expensive herbal medications were on the higher end of the socioeconomic scale and were more likely to afford these medications. It was also observed that <span class="yellow">garlic</span> and <span class="yellow">Echinacea</span> were the herbs of choice in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with higher educational levels. These herbs have a long tradition of use and are widely researched in Europe and North America. The traditional use and strong scientific evidence to support their therapeutic efficacy could be important factors influencing the <span class="blue">patient</span>'s decision. It has been suggested elsewhere that <span class="yellow">patients</span> with higher educational levels also tend be more involved in the management of their health; they tend to self-medicate or even suggest to their physicians the course of therapy.
Although one in five <span class="yellow">patients</span> using medicinal herbs stated that "conventional medicines were not working" as the reason for using this alternative healthcare modality, we noted that asthma severity does not affect the decision to use herbs. In previous studies, poor management was associated with non-compliance with prescribed pharmacotherapy and poor inhaler technique [5,6].
The backyard and home garden were major sources of readily available herbs such as aloes, <span class="yellow">shadon beni</span> and <span class="yellow">lemongrass</span>. Wild growing 'weeds' such as <span class="yellow">shandileer</span>, <span class="yellow">tulsi</span>, cocoa <span class="yellow">onion</span> and <span class="yellow">black sage</span> were also identified. The supermarket was a major source of inexpensive common medicinal herbs such as <span class="yellow">garlic</span>, <span class="yellow">ginger</span> and <span class="yellow">nutmeg</span>. The identification of these medicinal herbs provides an opportunity to investigate West Indian plants used to treat asthma to determine whether they possess pharmacological properties. Scientific investigations have shown that some of these herbs possess pharmacological and anti-inflammatory properties, and these may be useful in suppressing the characteristic exaggerated immune response in asthma [20-24]. Pepper and <span class="yellow">bayleaf</span> have also been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties [[25,26]27]. There is an imperative to commence scientific investigations on traditional West Indian medicinal plants to determine their therapeutic efficacy and safety.
The survey instrument specifically asked questions on the use of medicinal herbs in asthma and did not inquire about the use of herbs as customary teas or tonics. We therefore did not determine lifetime prevalence for the use of herbs in our <span class="blue">patient</span> sample, but we suppose that had this been included that there might have been a prevalence similar to those reported in the Jamaica [10,11] and Trinidad [13] surveys. The survey was also limited in that by electing to conduct the study at a public health facility we obviously had a bias towards <span class="yellow">patients</span> at the lower rung of the socioeconomic ladder, with lower income and educational status. As a consequence, the results reflected <span class="yellow">patients</span> from this demographic background. We may have expected a different outcome in asthmatic <span class="yellow">patients</span> attending private institutions, where their characteristics would have been slightly different, as we noted that even in our sample the small number of <span class="yellow">persons</span> with higher income and educational status tended to use more medicinal herbs for symptomatic relief.
We did not assess whether <span class="yellow">patients</span> informed their attending physician at the clinic about their use of herbs or determined whether the knowledge or attitudes of these physicians regarding the use of herbs influenced the <span class="yellow">patients</span>' decision to use herbs. The study was also limited in that we did not ascertain the out-of-pocket expense for herbal remedies by <span class="yellow">patients</span>, although most stated that herbal medicines (which we supposed were processed, imported products) were more expensive than conventional medicines. We assumed that an additional expense would have only been incurred by those <span class="yellow">patients</span> purchasing processed, imported herbs obtained from a herbalist, herbal shop or pharmacy (24.1%) and who actually consulted a herbalist (10.3%). We also reasoned that since all the other herbs used were inexpensive and available from either the backyard garden or supermarket (58.6%) that the cost to <span class="yellow">patients</span> selecting these remedies was minimal.<br><br>Conclusions
The findings of this study are important in that local medicinal plants in Trinidad have been identified in the self-management of asthma in a significant number of <span class="yellow">patients</span> attending the specialty clinic. These identified herbs can now be targeted for scientific investigation to determine whether their pharmacological efficacy will assist in the development of viable healthcare alternatives in a developing country. These findings are also important for policymakers in the health sector who are given the mandate to regulate issues pertaining to the public's health. We are also becoming more aware of the potential for critical interplay between herbs and drugs when taken concomitantly to produce life-threatening interactions. Since herbs are here to stay and <span class="yellow">patients</span> will continue to self-medicate with increasing frequency, it is imperative that healthcare providers become more knowledgeable on this modality and keep abreast with the latest developments in herbal therapy.<br><br>Competing interests

Abstract
There has been some evidence that Behçet's disease (BD) has a significant autoimmune component but the molecular identity of putative autoantigens has not been well characterized. In the initial analysis of the autoantibody profile in 39 Chinese BD <span class="yellow">patients</span>, autoantibodies to cellular proteins were uncovered in 23% as determined by immunoblotting. We have now identified one of the major autoantibody specificities using expression cloning. Serum from a BD <span class="blue">patient</span> was used as a probe to immunoscreen a λZAP expression cDNA library. Candidate autoantigen cDNAs were characterized by direct nucleotide sequencing and their expressed products were examined for reactivity to the entire panel of BD sera using immunoprecipitation. Reactivity was also examined with normal control sera and disease control sera from <span class="yellow">patients</span> with lupus and Sjögren's syndrome. Six independent candidate clones were isolated from the cDNA library screen and were identified as overlapping partial <span class="yellow">human</span> kinectin cDNAs. The finding that kinectin was an autoantigen was verified in 9 out of 39 (23%) BD <span class="blue">patient</span> sera by immunoprecipitation of the in vitro translation products. Sera from controls showed no reactivity. The significance of kinectin as a <span class="yellow">participant</span> in autoimmune pathogenesis in BD and the potential use of autoantibody to kinectin in serodiagnostics are discussed.<br><br>Introduction
Behçet's disease (BD) is a systemic vasculitic disease typified by a triad of symptoms including recurrent oral ulcers, genital ulcers and uveitis. In addition, skin, joint, large vessels, nervous system and gastrointestinal systems may be involved. BD is a global disease but has the highest prevalence in the region along the ancient 'Silk Road' in China. The etiopathogenesis of the disease remains unclear but microbial agent triggers, environmental factors, genetic predisposition, neutrophil hyperfunction, endothelial cell dysfunction and immunological abnormalities involving both T and B cells have been implicated. Increasing amounts of research evidence supports the possibility that it is an immune-mediated vasculitis, and that abnormal T-cell and B-cell reactions and autoantigen-driven autoimmunity play pivotal roles [1]. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the prototypic systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease with autoantibodies against cellular (particularly nuclear) antigens, some of which are critically implicated in the autoimmune pathology while others provide valuable serodiagnostic markers for the disease. Unlike the picture in SLE and other related rheumatic diseases, in BD, antinuclear antibodies and antibodies to neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens etc. are not present. To date, since neither a specific autoantibody nor pathognomonic pathological index is available to help establish the diagnosis of BD, it is largely or solely based on clinical manifestations [2], and a dilemma in diagnosis is not a rare occurrence in clinical practice. Nevertheless, since the 1960s, there have been reports of autoantibodies against certain unknown components of <span class="yellow">human</span> oral mucosa in sera of <span class="yellow">patients</span> with BD. Since then, sporadic reports on findings of autoantibodies in this disease have been described, such as antibodies to retinal antigen(s), heat shock protein (HSP) of some strains of <span class="yellow">Streptococcus sanguis</span> cross-reactive with <span class="yellow">human</span> HSP polypeptide [3], antibodies to endothelial cell antigens (AECA) and antibodies to α-tropomyosin [4,5], attesting to the complicated humoral immune disorders in this disease.
This investigation was aimed at defining target cellular autoantigens using time-tested and well-established molecular techniques. Immunoscreening of expression libraries using BD sera was used since this approach has been successfully employed in the characterization of many clinically relevant antigens in systemic rheumatic diseases such as SS-A/Ro [6-9] and SS-B/La [10] antigens in Sjögren's syndrome (SjS) and centromere antigen CENP-B [11] in scleroderma. In addition, we have been successful in using this strategy to identify interesting autoantigens that have other biological significance. Examples of these include NOR90/hUBF [12], p80-coilin [13], Golgi autoantigens [14-16] and, more recently, GW182 [17].<br><br>Materials and methods
<span class="yellow">Patients</span> and sera
The currently used empirical criteria for the diagnosis of BD in this study were the criteria proposed by the International Study Group for BD (abbreviated as 'International Criteria') [2]. The study subjects of 39 Chinese BD <span class="yellow">patients</span> comprised 17 males and 22 females, mean age 37 ± 11.3 years old, who were divided into two subgroups: 25 typical BD <span class="yellow">patients</span> (Group I, satisfying the International Criteria) and 14 clinically diagnosed BD <span class="yellow">patients</span> who had recurrent oral ulcers and one of the symptoms of genital ulcers, eye symptoms or skin lesions as defined by the International Criteria, as well as additional symptom(s) closely related to BD as listed in the International Criteria, that is, gastrointestinal ulcerations, deep vein thrombosis or arthralgia/arthritis without evidence that the latter symptoms might be related to any other disease (Group II, defined as 'probable BD' in this study). Disease controls included 10 <span class="yellow">patients</span> with SLE and 10 with SjS, all satisfying corresponding international classification criteria. All BD <span class="yellow">patients</span> and disease controls involved in the study were <span class="yellow">patients</span> treated at the Rheumatology Department of Ren Ji Hospital, Shanghai, China, where their clinical data and serum samples were collected. Twenty normal control sera were randomly selected from healthy blood donors working in the same hospital. This study was approved by the institution review board of Ren Ji Hospital which is affiliated with Shanghai Second Medical University, and each <span class="blue">patient</span> involved gave informed consent. All serum samples were preserved at -20°C or -70°C until use.<br><br>Cell lines and cell extracts
HeLa (ATCC CCL 2.2) and T24 (<span class="yellow">human</span> transitional cell bladder carcinoma) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA). A <span class="yellow">bovine</span> aortic endothelial cell line was kindly provided by Dr Eugene G Levin from the Scripps Research Institute (La Jolla, CA, USA). Cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% <span class="yellow">calf</span> serum, harvested and extracted in Buffer A (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) with protease inhibitor (Complete™; Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN, USA). For the preparation of whole cell extract, 10 volumes of Laemmli gel sample buffer [18] were added to the cell pellet, boiled for 3 min and stored at -20°C until use.<br><br>Western blot
Whole cell lysates from <span class="yellow">bovine</span> aortic endothelial cell, HeLa and T24 cells were resolved individually by discontinuous 7.5% gel SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli's method [18]. Immunoblotting was performed as described by Towbin et al. [19] with modifications. Nitrocellulose strips were blocked with 3% nonfat milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T) and then incubated with BD <span class="blue">patient</span> sera and normal control sera (1:100 dilution) at room temperature for 1 h. Filters were washed extensively with PBS-T to remove any unbound antibodies. Bound antibodies were detected with polyvalent, peroxidase-conjugated <span class="yellow">goat</span> anti-<span class="yellow">human</span> Ig and visualized by incubating the nitrocellulose strips in chemiluminescent reagents (NEN Life Science Products Inc., Boston, MA, USA) and exposing to Kodak XAR-5 films.<br><br>Screening of phage cDNA expression library with antibody probes
Serum from a BD <span class="blue">patient</span> showing the highest antibody titer in immunoblotting was selected as a probe and used at a dilution of 1:300 for initial immunoscreening of approximately 106 recombinants from a T24 cDNA expression library. The latter was constructed in λZAPExpress vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) and screened as previously described [20-22]. All screenings were performed on duplicate isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) pre-impregnated nitrocellulose filters, and immunoreactive clones were detected by chemiluminescence. Positive phages were subsequently plaque purified to 100% by two repeated rounds of screening at low plaque densities. Before screening the cDNA library, the BD serum was extensively adsorbed against bacteria and wild-type λZAP phage mixture to reduce background binding.<br><br>Analysis of candidate cDNAs
Purified candidate plaques were subcloned in vivo into pBK-CMV plasmids using ExAssist™ helper phage as recommended in the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The recombinant pBK-CMV plasmids were then purified using QIAprep Spin Minprep Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Restriction enzyme digestion of plasmids with EcoRI and XhoI and electrophoresis in a standard 1.0% agarose gel was used to analyze the length of cDNA insert of each candidate plasmid. The complete nucleotide sequence was determined using Bigdye terminator sequencing and a semi-automated sequencer model 377 (ABI, Foster City, CA, USA). Both nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were analyzed for similarity with known sequences using BLAST search [23] and ExPASy Proteomics tools . Secondary structure analysis for coiled-coil motifs was conducted with the software program COILS [24].<br><br>Immunoprecipitation of in vitro translation products
Candidate cDNA clones were used as templates for in vitro transcription and translation and the products were used as substrates for immunoprecipitation to confirm the specificity of reaction with BD sera. In brief, 1 μg of the pBK-CMV plasmid identified in the screening outlined above was added as template in a 50-μl reaction for the coupled in vitro transcription and translation reaction with a <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in the presence of 35S-methionine (Trans-35S label; ICN Biochemicals, Costa Mesa, CA, USA) and RNasin® Ribonuclease Inhibitor (Stratagene) as recommended by the manufacturer (Promega). Translation was carried out at 30°C for 1.5 h. Products were analyzed in a 12.5% gel SDS-PAGE and stored at -80°C for further immunoprecipitation analysis. The in vitro translation proteins were examined for reactivity by sera using immunoprecipitation described [8,25].<br><br>
Results and discussion
Autoantibody detection in sera from BD <span class="yellow">patients</span>
Initial examination of a group of 39 BD <span class="yellow">patients</span> using indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on a HEp-2 cell substrate did not yield any characteristic nuclear or cytoplasmic staining patterns. BD is thought by some to be a vasculitic disease involving pathophysiology of endothelial cells, and antibody to endothelial cell antigen (AECA) has been reported. Reports on the prevalence of AECA have varied largely and alpha-enolase was reported as one of the putative target antigens [26]. In this study, the use of <span class="yellow">bovine</span> aortic endothelial cells as substrate for IIF did not provide any additional data. However, Western blot analysis of the BD sera began to show some interesting autoreactivity using cell lysates from both HeLa and <span class="yellow">bovine</span> aortic endothelial cells. HeLa cells were initially used for this analysis because they are commonly used in the laboratory as Western blot substrate. Fig. 1 illustrates the common reactivity to 49 kDa and 120 kDa proteins in the endothelial cell lysates. These antigens were also detected in HeLa and T24 cells; the latter cell line was analyzed because our laboratory at The Scripps Research Institute has produced an excellent expression cDNA library from the T24 line and the positive result with the T24 cell extracts allowed us to screen the T24 library. Ig isotype analysis showed that all reactivity was largely IgG antibodies. Since the 49 kDa and 120 kDa bands were observed in cell extracts from <span class="yellow">bovine</span> as well as <span class="yellow">human</span> cell lines, these autoantigens might be evolutionarily conserved.
In total, nine out of 39 BD sera (23%) had autoantibody to the 49 kDa antigen and eight (20%) to the 120 kDa antigen. Four BD sera (10%) reacted with both proteins. Additionally, sera that showed common reactivity to the 120 kDa protein also demonstrated a common band that migrated at ~150 kDa, although it appeared weaker than the 120 kDa band. These antigens appeared to have different molecular weights than those of the known autoantigens in systemic rheumatic diseases. In addition, other reactive bands were detected but they were not as commonly shared as the 49 kDa and 120 kDa bands. The 49 kDa protein was shown to be distinct from 48 kDa SS-B/La or 50 kDa Jo-1 proteins (Fig. 1). The 120 kDa antigen was also shown to migrate differently from alanyl tRNA synthetase in another Western blot analysis (data not shown) and did not share any apparent crossreactive epitopes with the 49 kDa antigen. Western blot analyses of 20 normal control sera did not show the reactivities observed with BD sera. In order to further characterize these autoreactivities, a serum sample from the Group I definitive BD <span class="yellow">patients</span> with the strongest reactivity to 49 kDa and 120 kDa antigens (Fig. 1, lane 2) was selected as antibody probe for expression library screening.<br><br>Kinectin identified as a novel BD autoantigen
After screening 500,000 clones from the T24 cell λZAPExpress expression library, seven immunoreactive clones were isolated and plaque purified in two to three rounds to achieve 100% homogeneity. The cDNA inserts were subcloned in vivo into pBK-CMV plasmids, analyzed by restriction digestion using EcoRI and XhoI enzymes, and submitted to direct nucleotide sequencing across the polylinker arms. The cDNA inserts represented six independent clones designated BD41 (identical to BD44), BD481, BD42, BD47, BD482 and BD49. Their identities were established as overlapping partial cDNAs of <span class="yellow">human</span> kinectin, ranging from 1.9 kb to 3 kb (Fig. 2a). The full-length <span class="yellow">human</span> kinectin (GenBank accession number NM_182926[27]) has 4,816 bases containing an open reading frame coding 1,357 amino acid residues with molecular mass 156 kDa. All six cDNAs lacked the 5' portion of the kinectin sequence to different degrees but spanned a sequence of kinectin that extended to the 3'-untranslated region. Secondary structure analysis of kinectin protein using the program COILS identified a long region of α-helical coiled-coil domain that extended from amino acid residue 327 to the C-terminus (Fig. 2a, hatched boxes). In vitro coupled transcription and translation of BD44 and BD42 clones directed the synthesis of [35S]-methionine-labeled polypeptides that migrated at 95 and 60 kDa, respectively, in addition to smaller polypeptides (Fig. 2b). These products had predicted molecular weights of 103 kDa and 75 kDa.
Kinectin was initially identified in <span class="yellow">chick</span> embryo brain microsome as an integral membrane protein anchored in endoplasmic reticulum and involved in kinesin-driven vesicle motility along microtubules [28,29]. Kinectin consists of a 120-kDa and a 160-kDa polypeptide interacting through the α-helical coiled-coil domain to form a heterodimer [30]. The full-length kinectin is the 160 kDa polypeptide containing an N-terminal transmembrane helix followed by a bipartite nuclear localization sequence and two C-terminal leucine zipper motifs. We presume that the 120 kDa polypeptide detected in Western blot (Fig. 1) is the truncated version of the 160-kDa polypeptide, lacking the N-terminal first 232 amino acids [30]. The N-terminus of the 160-kDa polypeptide consists of a transmembrane domain that anchors kinectin to endoplasmic reticulum [30,31]. This 120 kDa polypeptide is probably the predominant form detected in the Western blot analysis (Fig. 1) because of its preferential solubility due to the omission of the N-terminal transmembrane domain.
Other functions for kinectin have been reported. <span class="yellow">Yeast</span> two-hybrid screen studies from several laboratories have revealed the interaction of the Rho family of GTPase with kinectin, and have shown the functional links among RhoG, kinectin and kinesin, with kinectin as a key effector of RhoG microtubule-dependent cellular activity [32]. Kinectin was also identified as an important constituent of integrin-based adhesion complexes, which link integrins to the cytoskeleton and recruit signaling molecules [33]. A new study reported that a kinectin isoform lacking a major portion of the kinesin-binding domain is very probably the most conservative form of kinectin; it does not bind kinesin but act as a membrane anchor for the translation elongation factor-1 delta in the endoplasmic reticulum [34].<br><br>Prevalence and specificity of anti-kinectin autoantibodies
The in vitro [35S]-methionine-labeled translation product of BD44, representing the largest recombinant kinectin fragment available, was used as the antigen substrate in an immunoprecipitation assay. Out of 39 BD <span class="blue">patient</span> sera, nine (23%) recognized the BD44 translation product (Fig. 3), whereas sera from 20 normal controls, 10 SLE and 10 SjS <span class="yellow">patients</span> did not show reactivity. Among the nine anti-kinectin positive <span class="yellow">patients</span>, six (6/25, 24%) were from Group I (definitive BD) including the BD <span class="blue">patient</span> whose serum was used in the immunoscreening of expression cDNA library, and three (3/14, 21.4%) <span class="yellow">patients</span> were from the Group II (probable BD) in this study. According to the Fisher Exact Probability calculation (P = 1.00), there is no statistically significant difference for antibody to kinectin between the two groups. The combined data substantiated the finding that kinectin is an autoantigen that can be recognized by sera from 23% of Chinese BD <span class="yellow">patients</span> in this study with at least one immunoreactive region or autoepitope residing within the BD44 encoded polypeptide.
Currently, there are more than six diagnostic/classification criteria for BD, among which the International Criteria have been applied most extensively due to its relatively high sensitivity (91%) and specificity (96%) [2]. As discussed above, differential diagnosis of BD might be confusing in clinical practice since no specific laboratory test is available, and some <span class="yellow">patients</span> may have symptoms and signs strongly suggestive of BD but do not fully satisfy the International Criteria, as in the Group II (probable BD) <span class="yellow">patients</span> in our study group. A number of investigators have pointed out that a comprehensive analysis of the clinical data for a given <span class="blue">patient</span> is very important for correct clinical diagnosis of BD, and that classification/diagnosis criteria, including the International Criteria, should be followed but should not be exclusive. The observation that three out of 14 <span class="yellow">patients</span> in the probable BD group also had antibody to kinectin and the similar percentage of positive reactors between this group and Group I (21.4% versus 24%) supports this notion. The further use of non-clinical parameters such as immunological biomarkers as adjuncts to identify BD <span class="yellow">patients</span> could be of help in the classification of this disease entity
While our work was ongoing, anti-kinectin antibodies were reported in sera from <span class="yellow">patients</span> with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [35,36] and aplastic anemia [37,38]. The first HCC report [35] identified kinectin as a tumor-associated antigen from the screening of an autologous cDNA library constructed from the cancer of a 30-year-old <span class="blue">patient</span> from Guangxi, China. This report stated that four out of five HCC <span class="yellow">patients</span> tested were positive for anti-kinectin antibody [35]. In 2004, another laboratory also reported the cloning of kinectin as a tumor-associated antigen from a (presumably) different 30-year-old Chinese HCC <span class="blue">patient</span> [36]. In contrast, anti-kinectin antibodies were not detected in other studies of HCC <span class="yellow">patients</span> associated with our laboratory [39,40]. The reports of anti-kinectin antibodies in aplastic anemia are also very interesting [37,38]. The initial report by Hirano et al. identified kinectin by screening an aplastic anemia <span class="blue">patient</span> for candidate antigens using a Clontech <span class="yellow">human</span> fetal liver cDNA expression library and it was concluded that seven out of 18 aplastic anemia <span class="yellow">patients</span> were positive for anti-kinectin while none of the normal or disease controls had this antibody [37]. In their recent report, Hirano et al. reported that anti-kinectin antibodies were found in 39% of aplastic anemia <span class="yellow">patients</span> from the United States but only in three out of 30 (10%) cases in Japan [38]. In our study reported here, kinectin antibodies were only detected in BD <span class="yellow">patients</span> and not in normal controls and SLE and SjS disease controls. None of the BD <span class="yellow">patients</span> with anti-kinectin had signs of HCC or aplastic anemia at the time of diagnosis and at up to 4 years of follow-up. Mapping of epitope(s) recognized by anti-kinectin antibodies may shed light on the question of whether different autoepitopes reside within the kinectin molecule recognized by sera from different diseases.<br><br>Kinectin – a new member of coiled-coil cytoplasmic autoantigens
We have recently reviewed the literature on the growing number of cytoplasmic autoantigens rich in α-helical coiled-coil domains as typified from our study of Golgi autoantigens [41]. Golgi autoantigens are generally high molecular weight proteins between 100 and 350 kDa and rich in coiled-coil domains in the central region with non-coiled-coil or globular domains at both N and C termini. Golgi autoantigens are displayed on the cytoplasmic face of the Golgi complex and are not localized to apoptotic blebs during apoptosis [42]. Giantin, the highest molecular weight Golgi autoantigen reported, is the predominant target of <span class="yellow">human</span> anti-Golgi complex antibodies and multiple non-cross-reactive epitopes have been mapped spanning the 350 kDa protein [43]. Other high molecular weight autoantigens with similar features have been reported in cytoplasmic and mitotic organelles suggesting that these selected proteins become autoimmunogenic based on their subcellular association and molecular features [41]. For example, in the endosomal compartment, the two known autoantigens are early endosomal protein EEA1 (180 kDa) [44] and CLIP-170 (170 kDa) [45]. There is also a series of centrosomal autoantigens identified as coiled-coil-rich proteins including pericentrin, a 220 kDa protein [46], ninein, a protein with alternatively spliced products of 245 and 249 kDa [47], Cep250 (250 kDa) and Cep110 (110 kDa) [48]. Centromere autoantigens have been described but the two interesting ones related to this discussion are CENP-E [49] and CENP-F [50]; both are high molecular weight proteins (312 to 400 kDa) and have the same type of overall structure as discussed above. NuMA is another large coiled-coil protein located at the mitotic spindle pole and is the most common target autoantigen in sera with mitotic spindle apparatus staining [51]. Non-muscle myosin (~200 kDa) is a cytoskeletal autoantigen [52] that falls in the same group of high molecular weight and coiled-coil-rich autoantigens. These endosomal, centrosomal, mitotic apparatus and intracellular autoantigens are, like the golgins, proteins with high molecular weights and an overall high content of coiled-coil domains. The combination of these two physical features in autoantigens may contribute to the induction and production of autoimmune antibodies in certain disease states. Kinectin is an integral membrane protein largely confined to the endoplasmic reticulum [28,31] and it fits into this new category of autoantigens that are large coiled-coil rich proteins (≥100 kDa) in the cytoplasm.<br><br>
Conclusion
Here we report the detection of kinectin autoantibody in 23% of Chinese <span class="yellow">patients</span> with BD. The identity of kinectin as a BD-related autoantigen has not been reported to date. Autoantibody reaction against kinectin in BD observed in this study further confirms the autoimmune involvement in BD and may provide new inroads into elucidating the immunopathogenesis of the disease. In an effort to clarify the association of BD with antibody to kinectin, it is essential to measure antibody to kinectin in larger <span class="blue">patient</span> populations including both BD, probable BD and important autoimmune rheumatic diseases such as SLE, SjS, rheumatoid arthritis etc., as well as those diseases not easily differentiated from BD, such as recurrent aphthous oral ulcer, Reiter's syndrome, inflammatory bowel diseases etc. On the other hand, further analysis of the association of anti-kinectin antibody with different manifestations or disease 'subtypes' of BD is another important project. Anti-kinectin is clearly only one of the antigen-antibody systems identified because there were many other antibodies observed in the Western blot analysis of BD sera. Using other sera for immunoscreening would probably lead to the identification of other potentially important antigen-antibody systems.<br><br>Abbreviations

<h3>pmcA1562423</h3>Alexithymia and anxiety in female chronic pain <span class="yellow">patients</span>
Abstract
Objectives
Alexithymia is highly prevalent among chronic pain <span class="yellow">patients</span>. Pain is a remarkable cause for high levels of chronic anxiety. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of alexithymia and to determine anxiety levels among DSM-IV somatoform pain disorder (chronic pain) female <span class="yellow">patients</span> and to examine the relationship between alexithymia and the self-reporting of pain.<br><br>Methods
Thirty adult females (mean age: 34,63 ± 10,62 years), who applied to the outpatient psychiatry clinic at a public hospital with the diagnosis of chronic pain disorder (DSM-IV), were included in the study. Thirty seven healthy females (mean age: 34,46 ± 7,43 years), who matched for sociodemographic features with the <span class="blue">patient</span> group, consisted the control group. A sociodemographic data form, 26-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-26), Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were administered to each subject and information was obtained on several aspects of the <span class="yellow">patients</span>' pain, including intensity (measured by VAS), and duration.<br><br>Results
Chronic pain <span class="yellow">patients</span> were found significantly more alexithymic than controls. There was a positive correlation between TAS-26 scores and the duration of pain. The alexithymic and nonalexithymic group did not differ in their perception of pain. Neither positive correlation nor significant difference was found between alexithymia and trait anxiety in pain <span class="yellow">patients</span>.<br><br>Discussion
Alexithymia may be important in addressing the diversity of subjective factors involved in pain. The conceptualization of alexithymia as a personality trait as well as a secondary state reaction is underlined by our data.<br><br><br><br>Background
The original definition of alexithymia is the inability to identify and use verbal language to describe feelings [1,2]. Alexithymia has been associated with a variety of psychiatric disorders as well as physical illness [3-10]. As a measure, Toronto Alexithymia Scale was significantly correlated with the measures of the tendency to experience and report physical signs and symptoms [11].
Several studies have found a high prevalence of alexithymia in pain <span class="yellow">patients</span>. Chronic pain <span class="yellow">patients</span> frequently exhibit many of the core features of alexithymia, such as problems in identifying and describing subjective feelings, impoverished imaginative abilities, and excessive preoccupation with physical symptoms and external events. Although several studies have found a high prevalence of alexithymia in pain <span class="yellow">patients</span>, the way alexithymia may possibly influence pain experience is still unclear [12,13].
DSM-IV-TR defines pain disorder as the presence of pain that is "the predominant focus of clinical attention" [14]. In chronic pain disorder, <span class="yellow">patients</span> complain of chronic pain, for which no physical etiology could be found or the underlying disorder is insufficient in explaining the symptoms. The pain causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Psychological factors are judged to have an important role in the onset, severity, exacerbation, or maintenance of the pain [15].
The alexithymic <span class="yellow">person</span>'s difficulty in identifying and describing feelings may increase symptom reporting by several mechanisms. Consequently, due to the difficulty to experience and express emotions, alexithymia has been linked with somatosensory amplification, which is the tendency to focus on benign somatic sensations. Alexithymic subjects are considered to focus on somatic manifestations of emotional arousal, resulting in misinterpretation of somatic sensations as signs of physical illness [12,13,16]. Accordingly, previous studies have found evidence of an association between alexithymia and the development of functional somatic symptoms, as seen in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with somatoform disorders. On the other hand, alexithymia may also occur as a secondary state reaction in response to severe and chronic medical illness [17-21].
Based on previous findings, these factors are worth receiving more attention in terms of clinical research. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of alexithymia among DSM-IV somatoform pain disorder (chronic pain) female <span class="yellow">patients</span> and to examine the relationship between alexithymia and the self-reporting of pain in this group of <span class="yellow">patients</span>. Besides, the study searched for the anxiety levels of chronic pain <span class="yellow">patients</span> with or without alexithymia.<br><br>Materials and methods
Sample
The sample consisted of 30 females who applied to the outpatient psychiatry clinic at a public hospital and who met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for chronic pain disorder. <span class="yellow">Patients</span> with concomitant psychiatric disorders, such as major depression, anxiety disorders and somatoform disorders other than pain disorder were excluded.
<span class="yellow">Patients</span> either directly applied to the psychiatry clinic themselves or were referred for psychiatric assessment from another outpatient clinic, mainly physical medicine and rehabilitation. After complete description of the study, written informed consent was obtained from each subject.
The control group was 37 healthy females, who matched for age, and education with the subjects. All subjects participated voluntarily in the study and gave consent after the procedure had been fully explained to them.
The mean age of the <span class="yellow">patients</span> and the healthy controls was 34,63 ± 10,62 (range: 16–62) and 34,46 ± 7,43 (range: 22–57) years and the educational level was 6,13 ± 3,03 (range: 5–11) and 6,59 ± 2,9 (range: 5–14) years, respectively. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to age (t = 0,79, df = 65, P > 0,05), educational level (t = 1,02, df = 65, P > 0,05), and marital status (x2 = 0,51, df = 1, P > 0,05).<br><br>Measures
A detailed sociodemographic data form was used for all subjects. All <span class="yellow">participants</span> were applied Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I) [22], Turkish version [23]. Regarding the pain assessment, information was first obtained on several aspects of the <span class="yellow">patients</span>' pain, such as intensity, and duration. Pain intensity was measured by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), using a horizontal 10-cm line with the statement 'no pain at all' at the extreme left-hand end and 'the worst possible pain' or 'unbearable' at the right-hand extreme. VAS is scored by measuring the distance from the end of the scale indicating absence of pain (or no distress or no pain relief) to the place marked by the <span class="blue">patient</span> [24].
The psychometric scales used in the study were the 26-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-26] and the Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), which were both validated in Turkish population studies [25-28]. TAS is a psychometrically well validated and reliable instrument in the assessment of alexithymia. TAS has been validated in Turkish studies as a true or false scale. Twenty-six items are scored either as 1 or 0 and the higher scores indicate higher degrees of alexithymia. TAS has an interval consistency of 0.65 [Kuder-Richardson) and test-retest reliability is r = 0.71, p < 0.01 in Turkish reliability and validity study. The sample was divided into nonalexithymic and alexityhmic groups, with the recommended cut-off score of 11 [27]. Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is one of the two sections of the Spielberger Anxiety Inventory (the other, measuring state anxiety). 'Trait anxiety' has been defined as anxiety proneness, that is, the tendency to respond to situations perceived as threatening with elevations in the intensity of state anxiety [26].<br><br>Statistical analysis
In order to determine the relative importance of a number of factors in pain disorders, we used both correlation analyses. The alexithymic and nonalexithymic groups were compared using the independent sample t-tests on scores of psychological tests. The statistical procedure, which was carried out by a SPSS package program for Windows using Chi-square, Fisher's exact test, two tailed t test and Pearson correlation coefficients, was also used to determine group differences (alexithymics versus nonalexithymics) in sociodemographic variables and various aspects of pain.<br><br>
Results
In the chronic pain group, 56.7% of <span class="yellow">patients</span> (n = 17) had a score greater than 11 on the TAS-26, and were considered alexithymic. The mean TAS-26 score of the alexithymic group (n = 17) was 17.88 ± 3.43 and the nonalexithymic group (n = 13) was 8.39 ± 2.02. Age (t = 1,38, df = 28, p > 0,18), education (t = -0,21, df = 28, p > 0,16) and marital status (x2 = 0,27, df = 1, p > 0,87) were not associated with alexithymia (Table 1).
In the control group, 24,3% of <span class="yellow">patients</span> (n = 9) were alexithymic according to TAS-26. The mean TAS-26 score of the alexithymic group (n = 9) was 13,82 ± 1,93 and the nonalexithymic group (n = 28) was 10,33 ± 0,86. Alexithymia was not associated with age (t = -1,08, df = 35, p > 0,29), educational level (t = 1,1, df = 35, p > 0,28), or marital status (x2 = 0,74, df = 1, p > 0,79) or anxiety levels in the control subjects (Table 1).
The duration and severity of pain, TAS-26 scores, and STAI scores of the female pain <span class="yellow">patients</span> are shown in Table 2. Comparison of the alexithymics with nonalexithymics on either the severity of pain or pain duration showed no statistical significance (t = 0,64, df = 28, p > 0,52, t = 2,05, df = 28, p > 0,05, respectively).
TAS-26 score and duration of pain were found positively correlated (r = 0,50, n = 30, p > 0,005). STAI (trait) scores of the alexithymics in the pain group did not significantly differ from the nonlalexithymics (t = 0,06, df = 28, p > 0,95) and besides, TAS-26 and STAI scores were not correlated (r = 0,06, p > 0,72).
In summary, there are three points to be emphasized. First, chronic pain <span class="yellow">patients</span> were found significantly more alexithymic than controls (56,7% to 24,3%). Second, a positive correlation was observed between TAS-26 scores and duration of pain. Third, neither positive correlation nor significant difference was found between alexithymia and trait anxiety in pain <span class="yellow">patients</span>.<br><br>Discussion
The results of the present study suggest that <span class="yellow">patients</span> with chronic pain disorder are more alexithymic than individuals with no pain. This finding is consistent with results obtained with earlier measures of alexithymia [11-13]. Although they may share common clinical features, alexithymia and somatoform pain are independent constructs. Alexithymia may be a consequence to the effects of severe physical symptoms, such as a reduced quality of life and limitations in daily activities. Besides, alexithymia may be conceptualized as a personality trait as well as a secondary state reaction [2,3,15-17]. In this study, the question investigated was whether alexithymia has any correlation with the duration or severity of the pain itself.
There were no significant differences between alexithymic and nonalexitymic <span class="yellow">patients</span> on self reports of current pain severity. This is in accordance with Cox's study [1994] in which it was further pointed out that alexithymic <span class="yellow">patients</span> were found to use significantly more verbal descriptors of pain compared to nonalexithymic <span class="yellow">patients</span> [13]. In our study, pain intensity was only evaluated by using VAS. One problem in trying to measure the intensity of pain is the lack of an objective way. Pain is a subjective experience and each <span class="blue">patient</span> may communicate in a different way, verbally or nonverbally [29]. <span class="yellow">Patients</span> in this sample were sufferers of chronic pain, who had already chosen an approved way of expressing their distress. Since this is true regardless of alexithymia, alexithymic groups and nonalexithymic groups in this sample showed no difference on pain severity.
The positive correlation between alexithymia and the duration of pain in this sample supports the assumption of a two-way hypothesis. It is often assumed that pain can be caused by alexithymic personality traits and also that severe and chronic pain may cause emotional change. One of the limitations of this study is that because of the cross-sectional design, we are unable to draw conclusions about the direction of causality between alexithymia and pain. The duration of the <span class="yellow">patients</span>' pain could approximately be determined, yet the preexisting level of alexithymia was not known. In the usual absence of internal stimuli, alexithymic <span class="yellow">person</span> may be expected to maintain an external focus of attention, such as pain. Symptom chronicity may force the alexithymic <span class="yellow">person</span> to attent to and amplify this somatic sensation.
Difficulties in the ability to identify and differentiate emotions and somatic experiences are core features of the alexithymic construct. Therefore, alexithymic <span class="yellow">patients</span> might be expected to differ from nonalexithymic ones in their anxiety levels. Yet, in our pain group alexithymic <span class="yellow">patients</span> showed no significant difference from the nonalexithymics on trait anxiety. Besides, alexithymia and anxiety were not correlated at all. The reasons may be lying in the specific characteristics of this <span class="blue">patient</span> group itself.
The study included <span class="yellow">patients</span> suffering from chronic symptoms; with an average of 7,44 ± 6,82 years of pain in the alexithymic and 3,31 ± 2,79 years in the nonalexithymic groups. Persistency of any physical symptom may bring along alexithymia as a coping strategy. In their paper, Crook and Tunks (1988) examined the types of coping strategies used by persistent pain sufferers and addressed to the importance to alter their attitudes and behavior that tend toward catastrophizing, avoidance and withdrawal, rather than simply concentrate on trying to teach them techniques for 'coping with stress' to help persistent pain sufferers [30]. Sufferers of chronic symptoms in this sample were members of a subgroup who have been seeking medical care for a long time and besides given the chance of being referred to a psychiatrist. Therefore, alexithymic or not, their anxiety might have induced unique coping strategies and illness behavior.
Alexithymia may be important in addressing the diversity of subjective factors involved in pain [31]. It is not known whether it should be addressed in the treatment of pain <span class="yellow">patients</span>, but a high level of alexithymia may effect the nature of assessment. In summary, the conceptualization of alexithymia as a personality trait as well as a secondary state reaction is underlined by our data. However, regarding the cross-sectional design of this study, only limited conclusions can be drawn about the nature of the causal relationship between alexithymia and chronic pain. Therefore, future longitudinal studies assessing the cause of alexithymic characteristics are required to fully elucidate the concepts of primary and secondary alexithymia.<br><br>
<h3>pmcA1931593</h3>Integration in primary community care networks (PCCNs): examination of governance, clinical, marketing, financial, and information infrastructures in a national demonstration project in Taiwan
Abstract
Background
Taiwan's primary community care network (PCCN) demonstration project, funded by the Bureau of National Health Insurance on March 2003, was established to discourage hospital shopping behavior of <span class="yellow">people</span> and drive the traditional fragmented health care providers into cooperate care models. Between 2003 and 2005, 268 PCCNs were established. This study profiled the individual members in the PCCNs to study the nature and extent to which their network infrastructures have been integrated among the members (clinics and hospitals) within individual PCCNs.<br><br>Methods
The thorough questionnaire items, covering the network working infrastructures – governance, clinical, marketing, financial, and information integration in PCCNs, were developed with validity and reliability confirmed. One thousand five hundred and fifty-seven clinics that had belonged to PCCNs for more than one year, based on the 2003–2005 Taiwan Primary Community Care Network List, were surveyed by mail. Nine hundred and twenty-eight clinic members responded to the surveys giving a 59.6 % response rate.<br><br>Results
Overall, the PCCNs' members had higher involvement in the governance infrastructure, which was usually viewed as the most important for establishment of core values in PCCNs' organization design and management at the early integration stage. In addition, it found that there existed a higher extent of integration of clinical, marketing, and information infrastructures among the hospital-clinic member relationship than those among clinic members within individual PCCNs. The financial infrastructure was shown the least integrated relative to other functional infrastructures at the early stage of PCCN formation.<br><br>Conclusion
There was still room for better integrated partnerships, as evidenced by the great variety of relationships and differences in extent of integration in this study. In addition to provide how the network members have done for their initial work at the early stage of network forming in this study, the detailed surveyed items, the concepts proposed by the managerial and theoretical professionals, could be a guide for those health care providers who have willingness to turn their business into multi-organizations.<br><br><br><br>Background
Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) under the control of the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI), was launched in March 1995 to replace its social insurance system that was covering 59% of its population: government employees, labourers, farmers and servicemen [1]. By June 2003 the number of <span class="yellow">people</span> insured had reached 21,956,729 (99%). There were 17,259 medical providers (92%), including 575 hospitals and 16,684 clinics contracted with the BNHI for serving the enrolled population. The unique phenomenon characterized in Taiwan health care industry different from those in the western countries is the freedom of <span class="yellow">patients</span> to choose the health care providers they want, no matter what their disease severity is. Furthermore, Taiwan <span class="yellow">people</span> favor the larger scales of facilities and this fallacy leads to the phenomenon of big-hospital shopping. For example, <span class="yellow">people</span> choose the medical centers which are accredited as the highest level of medical science in Taiwan when they only suffer from a common cold.
In the spring of 2003, the SARS epidemic viciously attacked the health of Taiwan's <span class="yellow">people</span>. The <span class="yellow">people</span>'s freedom to choose medical providers caused the national health authority to barely control and traced the flow of epidemic. This event made Taiwan national health authorities rethink what happened and how it damaged under the traditional fragmented health care providers in Taiwan. One health reform launched was named the "Primary Community Care Network (PCCN) demonstration project", a nationwide health care financing program funded by the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) in March 2003 and it was a new model for the Taiwan government to redefine the role of family physicians in the health care delivery system. A PCCN in Taiwan consists of a group of clinic physicians whose medical jobs are viewed as family care and at least one hospital for secondary or tertiary care. The idea of member component design in PCCNs was aimed to lead the Taiwan citizens to choose one clinic physician as their personal family physician for health maintenance and this family physician also would have the responsibility of referring the <span class="yellow">patients</span> to specialty care if necessary. From a national health authority perspective, they expected the Taiwan <span class="yellow">people</span> to put an end to their fallacy that "bigger is better" for health care organizations and establish the idea of "<span class="yellow">human</span> health", starting with prevention and primary care, followed by secondary or tertiary care, emphasizing health promotion and maintenance instead of disease curing. Furthermore, it could decrease the inappropriateness of medical usage, i.e., over-uses of secondary and tertiary medical services in the high-tech hospitals. In addition, the national health authority was expected to drive the traditional fragmented heath care providers into coordinated medical multidisciplinary teams and share the limited medical resources through the PCCN demonstration project. In summary, the PCCN demonstration project was aimed to: 1) change the traditional <span class="yellow">patients</span>' customs of freely choosing health care organizations and establish referral channels along the continuum of care, and 2) establish partnerships among the primary care clinics and hospitals to provide a continuum of health care services. It was also expected to establish the primary care system of family physicians to provide whole-<span class="yellow">people</span> health care and improve care quality [1].
Partnership structures in the PCCNs represent the virtual vertical (i.e., between the member clinics and hospitals) and virtual horizontal (i.e., among the member clinics) aspects of organizing, which designate the formal relationships between individuals and the total network and include organizational design to ensure effective communication, coordination, and integration across the total network. Each PCCN consists of five to ten clinics: half of them should offer the services of general medicine, internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatric, or family medicine. And each PCCN has a central headquarters, usually in one of the clinic facilities, to coordinate and integrate the network. All the clinic physicians in a PCCN are assigned the roles of "family physicians" or "gatekeepers" who recruit <span class="yellow">people</span> from the local community, keep background and medical files on them, certify family physician education training programs, and hold office hours in the member hospital, where they serve as joint faculty members for further medical consultations or medical utilizations of labs and tests, if necessary. In addition, the hospital member is asked to help clinic physicians in their network to set up a medical information system, share hospital resources (medical equipment and library literature) with the clinic physicians in their network and establish referral channels among the network members. Furthermore, this new demonstration model tries to minimize the barriers to <span class="blue">patient</span> access by setting up 24-hour a day, 7-day a week medical consultation telephone lines for providing urgent services onsite and for taking care of the <span class="yellow">patients</span> whose family physicians' practices are closed to assure seamless care channels. The BNHI funded these extra demonstration actions, at around one hundred thousand US dollars (i.e., NT$3,500,000) for each PCCN under the current fee-for-service payment system [1].
Figure 1 describes the organizational structure of individual PCCNs introduced in the demonstration project in Taiwan.
To date, the PCCN demonstration project has been in operation for more than three years. There have been 268 PCCNs formed in the period of 2003 to 2005 around Taiwan. The geographical distributions of PCCNs and their members were described in Table 1. Analyzing all 1,557 participating clinic members in the demonstration project in terms of medical specialties, they cover general medicine, internal medicine, surgeries, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, family medicines, otolaryngology, ophthalmology, rehabilitation medicine, dermatology, and psychiatry, with 237 clinics providing more than two specialties. On the other hand, each PCCN recruits at least one district or regional accredited hospital for acute care demands (required for network members) and a medical center for tertiary care support (not required for network members). There are 6 medical centers, 52 regional hospitals, and 71 district hospitals joining in the demonstration project. See Table 1 for more detailed information about the PCCN members.
To date, there have been few empirical studies of the working relationships that have developed between members of the PCCN program. Partnership needs a method to determine at an early stage, to make sure whether they are making the most of collaboration [2] and the acceptance of the contracting networks in Taiwan as an organizational innovation worthy of greater diffusion deserves to be explored. Therefore, this study used a structured questionnaire to characterize the relationship among the members in the individual PCCNs, with regard to governance, clinical, marketing, financing, as well as information integration infrastructures. The results of this study provide descriptive analyses in detail to map the partnership developments, to enrich the body of knowledge of the partner relationships and to help policy makers understand the coordinated efforts of these health care providers which have developed under this system. It also provides the recommendations for heath policy decision-making and management of networks of health care providers for the future involvement.<br><br>Methods
This study was aimed at providing descriptive analyses to map the partnership development. To understand the actual integration actions done by network members, the theoretical concept employed by network partnerships were described and then the derived survey instrument was developed.
Theoretical framework for organization design of network integration
The rapid organizational changes in the health care industry have driven theorists from every discipline and across the world to seek an approach that allows organizations to flourish. Organization theory allows investigators to profile an organization from the aspect of patterns and regularities in organizational design and behavior. In the early 20th century, classical management theorists claimed that an organization has "a best way" to be organized and managed [3]. That implied that all organizations would own the "same" organizational styles or structures. In the 1960s, several theorists [4-8] challenged this assumption by applying a "contingency approach" to propose that there is no best way to organize an organization, and that the effectiveness of an organizational structure varies with the situation of an organization. Furthermore, it is proposed that the best way to organize an organization depends on the nature of the environment to which the organization relates.
Contingency theory delineates the concepts "organization's internal features," "the demands of organizational environments," "best adaptation," and, the most important and difficult of all, "best match" [9]. Lawrence & Lorsch [7] argued that environments characterized by uncertainty and rapid rates of change in market conditions or technology impose different demands, including constraints and opportunities, on organizations than do placid and stable environments. Similarly to Lawrence and Lorsch's views mentioned above, Galbraith [10,11] stressed the contingency perspective on information processing. The information-processing approach emphasizes that environment, size, and technology impose different information-processing requirements on organizations, and thus an organization must be designed to encourage information flow in both vertical and horizontal directions to achieve the overall tasks of the organization and, finally, organizational effectiveness [11-14].
Some theorists have criticized conventional contingency theorists who presume that organizational structure is driven by the environment. <span class="yellow">Child</span> [15], Miller [16], Van de Ven and Drazin [17], and Tushman and Romanelli [18] raised such criticisms; they argued that organizations become what they are not only because of the environment, but also because of choices made by members, especially choices about strategy and organizational design. As Thompson's words in the book Organizations in Action [8] put it, "organizations are not determined simply by their environments (p.27)." He also pointed out that "administration may innovate on any or all of the necessary dimensions, but only to the extent that innovations are acceptable to those on whom the organization can and must depend." Instead of assuming that administrators are highly constrained in their decisions, strategic contingency theorists emphasized "the importance of choice," that is, "the freedom of agency" [15]. Furthermore, Pfeffer [19] explicitly pointed out that "organizational structures are the outcomes of political contests within organizations (p.38)."
Daft [14] proposed a top management model to delineate how "a strategy is a plan for interacting with the competitive environment to achieve organizational goals." He stated that the major responsibility of top management is to determine the goals, strategy, and design of an organization to adapt to a changing environment. To assess the external and internal environments of an organization seems to be the first task for top managers in defining an organization's goals and missions. Then, guided by the goals and missions of the organization, top managers shape the design of the organization, including structural forms, information system, technology, <span class="yellow">human</span> resources, organizational culture, and inter-organizational linkages, to achieve the final organizational performance.
Integration refers to the mechanisms of coordination, the ways guided to partnership goals to fit internal and external conditions [7,20,21]. In the early 1990s, proposals for US national health care reform recognized the need for integrating mechanisms to achieve both financial success and quality of care of a well-organized system of care [22,23]. Several researchers also viewed inter-organizational cooperation as resource exchanges, including client referrals, money, and staff [24-27]. From practical ways of viewing integration, the success of integration lies in the coordinative mechanisms and partnership working that support it [28], including an administrative organization that coordinates the operations of various health care services; a management information system that integrates clinical, utilization, and financial data and follows clients across different settings; a care coordination program such as case management or disease management that works with clients to arrange health care services; and a financial mechanism that enables pooling of funds across services [29-35]. Fox [36] suggested the success of integrated health networks should ensure that the new business link such aspects as technology, functional skills, customer access, management, or products that can be shared across both the core and the new business; to conduct market financial evaluation; to share the risk of vertical integration with outside entities, to develop the management structure that can reflect the degree of coordination necessary to support the core business activities; to ensure that the integration strategy meets the needs of customers, including medical treatment, the use of medical technology, and the preferred methods of purchase; and to measure the new business by its value to the enterprise as a whole, rather than by its profitability as a stand-alone entity.
In summary, the effects that integration in inter-organizational designs has on network management were substantial from a managerial perspective. Borrowing the ideas of strategic contingency perspective [8,15,19] and top management model [14], it could be imply that success (organization performance) in reengineering a network lies in the integration of process and services (see Figure 1), including leadership/governing structure, teamwork between disciplines and <span class="blue">patient</span> care, financial planning, and information systems, characterized as the constructs of governance, clinical, financial, and information infrastructures, respectively, in this study. In addition, another construct, marketing infrastructure, was especially important and designed to explore for PCCNs in this study because of <span class="yellow">patients</span>' freedom of making healthcare choice and the traditional fragmented health care systems by individual health care organizations in Taiwan. One major reason for Taiwan <span class="yellow">people</span>'s hospital shopping preferences was that Taiwan <span class="yellow">people</span> usually believe the bigger the facility, the better capacities a facility has no matter on any aspect from medical professionals to tangible medical equipment and plants. And this fallacy made the public want to overuse the facility with high-tech medical services no matter if it fits their needs. From the health policy and management perspectives, therefore, the health care providers were encouraged to market their services as a new corporate identity and brand strategy [37], including offering tangible resources such as books, libraries, medical equipment, and intangible resources such as knowledge and information exchanges (education) and reputation sharing one another among PCCN members. Furthermore, through the process of marketing resource exchanges, therefore, each PCCN could establish the images of "one system, one brand and quality" for the public and for the health care providers. It also makes it be more visible to the public.
The five integration infrastructures of network management were constructed as a conceptual framework in this study to help to portray how the PCCN members have done. The survey instrument development was described in the following.<br><br>Survey instrument development: integration infrastructures and measurements of partnerships
Based on the five integration infrastructures of network management, the structured questionnaire were derived from extensive literature reviews.
Governance infrastructure
Governance assumes the broad responsibility for organizational goals and survival and involves the series process of setting and monitoring organizational goals and strategy development through a board of representatives [38]. Governance or administrative integration infrastructure in establishing network partnerships refers to administrative structures (or responsibilities) created to facilitate communication, clear lines of authority, accountability, and responsibility for <span class="blue">patient</span> care services; to negotiate budgets and financial trade-offs; and to present a cohesive, consistent message in interactions with external agencies and the community [29,39-41] and most important for members in contract agreements, to manage participation [33]. From a multidisciplinary perspective, Mitchell and Shortell [42] applied the concepts of governance and management characteristics in effective community health partnerships. The construct of governance involved several tasks, including setting priorities for strategic goals, choosing the membership composition, obtaining the necessary financial resources, and setting up the accountability systems, and so on. The construct of the management refers to the tasks of engaging and maintaining organizational members' interest in a shared vision and mission, providing appropriate structures and coordination mechanisms for the specified strategies, promoting constructive conflicts and managing destructive conflicts, implementing information systems to monitor the dynamics, adjusting the leadership in the overall membership, and so on. The issues of governance and administrative integration in the PCCNs could include [2,38,40,41,43-47]:
• planning the shared visions and missions
• determining the shared service strategies, cooperation priorities, policies and principles
• identifying the information needed and how to get it
• organizing the network dynamics and member roles
• leading and managing the conflicts and communication
• designing and controlling the shared network performance systems, including indicator settings, feedbacks, and accountability.<br><br>Clinical infrastructure
The idea of care integration begins through such public programs that include social workers in public welfare departments, caseworkers in mental health, or nurses in public health departments. In the late 1980s, care integration was deemed necessary for the streamlining of care and negotiating the maze of long-term care services. At that time, it was referred to as service coordination or case management, or in other related terms [29]. The purpose of care integration is to work directly with <span class="yellow">patients</span> and their families over time to help them arrange and manage the complex resources that <span class="yellow">patients</span> may need to maintain health and independent functioning. At the same time, care integration is used to achieve the most cost-effective use possible of scarce resources, by steering <span class="yellow">patients</span> to the health, social, and support services most appropriate for them at a given time [29]. Conrad and Dowling [33] pointed out that to coordinate and integrate <span class="blue">patient</span> care relies on connecting <span class="blue">patient</span> services at the different stages of the <span class="blue">patient</span> care processes. Care coordination in integrated networks can be achieved through integration of training programs and some clinical services, provision of complementary clinical capabilities, clinical geographic proximity design, clear role definition of each institution, commitment and flexibility of leaderships and medical staffs, and the support of a large referring physician groups embracing the affiliation concepts [48]. The issues of clinical integration in the PCCNs could include [48-50]:
• planning and differentiating target markets based on the clinical services of the network members
• uniting individual clinical professionals for clinical project planning
• designing <span class="blue">patient</span>-centered care or case management teams
• establishing committees responsible for <span class="blue">patient</span>-centered case report meetings, case referral, transfer, and tracing, file management (record and information exchanges), clinical quality management (quality assurance, improvement, risk and malpractice management, and utilization review), and medical continuing education and on-job education.<br><br>Marketing infrastructure
Marketing integration refers to how to work together as a whole both from the provider and <span class="blue">patient</span> perspectives. One of the case reports interviewing developing integrated delivery system or networks realized that the most important thing is how an integrated system or network is promoted and what is promoted for the consumers [51], including focusing on product development, making sure the branding holds together, marketing directly to consumers, demonstrating values to consumers, and even conducting marketing research to make efforts for the long term. In a health care network with several organizational members and target <span class="yellow">patients</span>, the marketing infrastructure in PCCNs here refers to provider members' marketing, meaning the resource sharing and market development in a PCCN as a whole. The issues of the marketing integration in the PCCNs could include [37,52-54]:
• sharing the literature and facility publications among the network members
•uniting public promotions such as united activities, electronic and paper media for enhancing the network reputation as "one system, one brand and quality"
• differentiating target markets of the network for competing in the medical industry.<br><br>Financial infrastructure
Comprehensive, flexible, and adequate financing is a goal of the ideal continuum of care. That component is the most critical and challenging to manage under the changes in the health care delivery environment. Gillies et al. [30] suggested that integrating financial management across operating units adds the greatest value to systems or organizations. In one case study, Bramson et al. [55] also showed that reducing costs through joint purchasing by the radiology departments of a vertically integrated health system could yield substantial savings. The issues of the financial integration in the PCCNs could include:
• budgeting
• uniting equipment, medical materials, and drug purchasing and routine administrative stuff management
• pooling recruitment funds
• designing a financial risk and sharing mechanism.<br><br>Information infrastructure
Information is an essential component of an organization. A complete information system can help an organization to integrate its individual units and efficiently manage the continuum. The ideal information system for a continuum of care was conceived of and formed in the mid-1980s [56]. During the late 1980s, computer technology began to make an information system feasible and affordable through new computer chips with expanded capability and networking technology. In the 1990s, the individual services of the continuum upgraded their information systems to combine clinical, financial, and utilization data [29]. Some studies have argued that the quality of information systems can drive costs down, because a good information system can give physicians easy electronic access to complete the documentation of the <span class="yellow">patients</span>' clinical records, better inform them about reimbursement and capitation issues, help them easily associate and manage cases together, and achieve a higher level of professional satisfaction [57,58]. Using Inova Health System, an integrated delivery system in northern Virginia, as an example, Wager, Heda, and Austin [59] showed that by developing a health information network within an integrated delivery system, Inova can have a clinical transaction system for hospitals and other entities, a data repository for decision support and outcome management, a managed care information system to support managed care and capitation contracts, and greater capability to acquire physicians. The issues of information coordination include [60-68]:
• establishing an electronic medical record system, regional information network for <span class="blue">patient</span> clinical and administrative data, clinical service arrangements and administrative work
• uniting the system information management and web pages.
The structured questionnaire was developed with the wording of practical managerial actions based on the five concepts just mentioned. There were 19 survey items on governance infrastructure, 25 on clinical infrastructure, 13 on marketing infrastructure, 20 on financial infrastructure, and 7 on information infrastructure. All 84 items were, simultaneously, applied to examine the relationships of the clinic's peer members and the relationship of clinic and hospital members in a PCCN, and it resulted in a total of 168 survey questions. The detailed information of the item questions was listed in Table 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The structured questionnaires were drafted from previous literatures and then examined by two academic professors for theoretical accuracy. Then one pilot study was pre-tested for the PCCN pioneers (i.e., 92 network clinic members) and 116 hospital providers which have partner relationships with other health care organizations (i.e., hospitals, clinics, long-term care facilities). The wordings and meanings of each question item were revised to assure content validity. The Cronbach α values for the five integration constructs – governance, clinical, marketing, finance, and information infrastructure were 0.946, 0.958, 0.932, 0.944, and 0.898 for the measures of clinic-clinic member relationships; and 0.945, 0.949, 0.916, 0.948, and 0.896 for the measures of clinic-hospital member relationships.<br><br>
Study subjects
To find the member partnership, we sent questionnaires to 1,557 individual clinics which had belonged to PCCNs for at least one year, based on information contained in the Taiwan Primary Community Care Network List (Bureau of National Health Insurance 2003, 2004 and 2005).
We let clinic members in all PCCNs point out how they coordinate with their peer clinic members and hospital members within a PCCN because individual clinic members could be better informants than hospital members, which need to deal with multiple clinic relationships and therefore might find it hard to describe the coordination involvement one by one with clinic members. Moreover, networks form for various reasons and it might lead to the various involvements by individual network members (i.e., hospital and clinic members). Therefore, using the participating clinics as individual survey units, the results could portray the overall dynamics and processes more authentically and detailed throughout all PCCNs in the demonstration project.
Nine hundred and twenty-eight clinics responded (59.6 %), with 239 clinics in the Taipei region, 165 in the northern region, 241 in the central region, 108 in the southern region, 150 in the Kao-Ping region, and 15 in the eastern region of Taiwan. Ten clinics had not mentioned their practicing locations. There is no statistically significant difference in geographical distribution between the respondents and the study population (χ2 = 4.208, p > 0.05).<br><br>Analytical techniques
The data was first analyzed descriptively with frequency counts (percentage) for each survey item, instead of using mean as a statistical method, because the variation among the respondents may not represent the normal distribution and it might ignore the extreme values for the respondents' answers. To compare how the respondents perceived the strength of integration existing in clinic-clinic and clinic-hospital relationships, paired t-tests were performed for individual survey items, using the original numerical scores.<br><br>
Results
Profiling the partnerships in Taiwan PCCNs: governance infrastructure
With regard to the governance infrastructures, the frequency was counted for each survey item with recalculated scales: disagree (Likert scale 1 and 2), fair (Likert scale 3), and agree (Likert scale 4 and 5) with individual items. In clinic-clinic relationship (Table 2), the majority of clinic members agree that the determined deals were obeyed (Table 2, item 1: 88.69%), the goals and strategies of members were well-understood (Table 2, item 16: 79.74%), and the united principals for individual members were developed (Table 2, item 15: 79.42%). The higher percentages were also found in clinic-hospital relationship in the same items (Table 2). On the other hand, establishing fair coordination mechanism (Table 2, item 11: 27.91%), designing and employing the network performance indicators (Table 2, item 3: 21.23%), and establishing communication models and channels (Table 2, item 12: 19.94%) still occupied higher percentages not developed and deserved to been made the focus of more efforts in the future. Paired t-test analyses for all individual survey items of governance infrastructure showed that the deals obeyed (Table 2, item1) and plans and goals controlled (Table 2, item 2) were achieved more in clinic-clinic relationships than those in clinic-hospital relationships; however, the design of network performance indicators (Table 2, item 3), development of disintegration policy and principals (Table 2, item 8), and the establishment of fair coordination mechanism (Table 2, item 11) were reached more in clinic-hospital relationships than those in clinic-clinic relationships.<br><br>Profiling the partnerships in Taiwan PCCNs: clinical infrastructure
Examining the extent of clinical infrastructure for network members, establishing two-directed <span class="blue">patient</span> referral systems and <span class="blue">patient</span> referral information files (Table 3, items 35 & 37) and uniting medical continuing education and on-job education (Table 3, item 34) were shown at a highly implemented rate in clinic-clinic (more than 70%) and clinic-hospital (more than 80%) relationships. On the other hand, network members had higher percentages (more than 40%) not to think about the possible integration mechanisms including establishing committees to deal with medical malpractice (Table 3, item 44), planning and differentiating clinical market areas (Table 3, item 20), and designing <span class="blue">patient</span>-centered case management teams (Table 3, item 22). Overall, there was better clinical integration involvement for all the described items in clinic-hospital relationships than those in clinic-clinic relationships within a network in this study (see Table 3, paired t-tests, p < 0.05).<br><br>Profiling the partnerships in Taiwan PCCNs: marketing infrastructure
For marketing planning, the clinics had better integrated marketing activities with their respective hospitals than with peer clinic members within PCCNs for all studied items (Table 4, paired t-test, p < 0.05). Examining the clinic-clinic relationships, uniting social activities (Table 4, item 53), sharing the individual facility reports for updated services (Table 4, item 46), public promotion (Table 4, item 54), and uniting and joining the facility activities (Table 4, item 51) were the top four marketing works done among clinic members (more than 60% implemented rate); and those items also showed a higher implemented rate (more than 70%) between clinic and hospital members.
On the other hand, facility assets such as reports (Table 4, item 49), and professional literatures and books (Table 4, item 45) were not well-shared among clinic members ("never-thinking" rate: 42.13%). In addition, uniting the network publication could make more efforts in the future ("never-thinking" rate in item 50: 39.98%). The room for clinic-hospital partnership to think about acting was kind of different from those in the clinic-clinic relationship. In addition to the uniting publication that can be encouraged to improve the clinic-hospital relationship (Table 4, item 50: 27.48%), cooperating in research projects (Table 4, item 52: 25.00%) and identifying and differentiating target markets (Table 4, item 57: 24.57%) had still more opportunities to be focused on in the future.<br><br>Profiling the partnerships in Taiwan PCCNs: financial infrastructure
The PCCN members were found to have a lower extent of financial integration as evidenced by higher percentage of ''never thinking'' scale about the survey items on almost all items (see Table 5). Slightly more integration (that is, ''acting'' rate) was found in only four items both in clinic-clinic relationships and in clinic-hospital relationships, including uniting budget planning (Table 5: item 58), sharing places, materials, and equipment (Table 5: item 68), uniting budgeting for certain services (Table 5: items 72), and designing the resource distribution principals based on the whole network goals (Table 5: item 77).
Further examining the financial infrastructure in clinic-clinic relationship and clinic-hospital relationship, paired-t tests revealed that clinic-hospital partnerships were involved more in places, materials, and equipment sharing and maintenance (Table 5, items 62 and 68) (p < 0.05) and higher financial infrastructure coordination exists in clinic-clinic relationships (Table 5, items 58, 59, 63–65, 72, 74, 75, and 77) (p < 0.05).<br><br>Profiling the partnerships in Taiwan PCCNs: information infrastructure
There was significantly greater integration of information in clinic-hospital than clinic-clinic relationships in all items in this category (Table 6, paired t-tests, p < 0.001). The greatest integration was found in electronic <span class="blue">patient</span> records (Table 6: item 78), followed by information integration for <span class="blue">patient</span> data (Table 6: item 79) and clinical service arrangements (Table 6: item 81). The lowest level of integration in information infrastructure was found in administrative works such as registration, billing and so on (Table 6: item 82, ''never-thinking'' rate more than 50%) within network members.<br><br>
Discussion
In this study, we surveyed 943 clinics that had belonged to Taiwan PCCNs for more than a year to understand the nature and extent of integration to which they and their associated PCCN members (clinics and hospitals) had in governance, clinical, marketing, financial, and information infrastructures. It was found a wide variance in the kind and degree of integration among them and a lot of room for better integration (Table 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
From the governance perspective, we found lower integration was found in the establishment of fair coordination mechanism (Table 2: item 11) among member clinics and member hospitals. Coordination could be viewed from different perspectives, including the use of standardized languages and forms, organizational rules and procedures, the establishment of common rules, policies, and procedures, and the monitoring through memos, reports, and a computerized information system [69,70]. Facing the cumbersome integration processes, it suggests that each PCCN's headquarters should become actively involved and clarify the authority, responsibility and accountability of individual members, identify the potential conflict sources, and publicize the rules and regulation of network integration dynamics covering decision making processes, market planning, clinical teamwork designs, and financial reports of individual network members. These actions could enhance the trust and respect of network members one another and could improve the small extent of integration found in this study about the mechanisms for communication models and channels in the PCCNs (Table 2: item 12). From the network management perspective, communication could occur between the various entities such as between hospital and clinics, primary care physicians and specialists, managers and clinical professionals, and even among the clinical professionals in the network. To develop effective and timely communication channels was the key for the management of integrated organizations [30-32] and could alleviate the tensions that sometimes occur in the dynamics of the multi-organizations. In this study, it was found a low level of involvement of medical teams in medical projects, <span class="blue">patient</span>-centered case management, and case report meetings among the network members (Table 3: item 21, 22, and 23) from a clinical integration perspective. Several researchers have addressed that clinical integration providing a process of medical management, care management, case management, and <span class="blue">patient</span> management designed to transform the traditionally fragmented delivery system into a more cohesive system [71], and lead to higher service quality and assure financial objectives [72,73]. More attention could be paid to these activities in the future. In addition, it was also found less integration in planning and differentiating clinical market areas (Table 3, item 20) among the network members in the category of clinical infrastructure. This may result from the existing specialty diversities in individual PCCNs, which might not need to involve planning and differentiating market area based on the members' clinical services at the early stage of network development.
There was more involvement in marketing efforts in clinic-hospital relationships than in clinic-clinic relationships. Generally speaking, hospitals have more resources (i.e., money, <span class="yellow">human</span> resources, materials, and physical assets) than clinics, which might explain the stronger marketing involvements between the clinic and hospital members, including the library sharing (books and literatures), facility brochure dissemination, public promoting, and medical research cooperation. These integration efforts also meet the expectation of the national health authority for resource sharing and medical quality image enhancement among the health care providers.
Financial infrastructure was found to be the least integrated, with most items never considered. Perhaps the only reason for the higher score of budget planning activities (Table 5: items 58 and 77) was that BHNI required each PCCN to design and determine its budgeting arrangement in advance before joining the demonstration project. While slightly more financial involvement was made among network members (Table 5: items 68, 72 & 73), possibly due to similar needs, there remains a lot of room for financial integration in the future.
There was a need for networks to develop electronic information systems, though creating and managing an integrated information system involves very detailed work. Most of the clinics surveyed have focused more on the individual public members' administrative works such as filing <span class="blue">patient</span> medical records, collecting and managing network <span class="blue">patient</span> clinical data, and scheduling clinical services, which were required by the BNHI. The factors for the health care managers to adopt the integrated clinical information systems include the decision of make or buy, adoption leadership, adoption objectives, implementation leadership, phased versus simultaneous implementation, parallel systems, information technology implementation policies and practices, use levels and resistance, and realized benefits and return on investment calculation [66], which might be very cumbersome and time-consuming. It suggests that the network partners might be engaged, firstly, more in simpler network cooperation such as the administrative systems for <span class="blue">patient</span> admission to the network members and establishing united web pages for <span class="yellow">patients</span> to access their family physicians and network members for medical and public promotion purposes. And for further integrated information investments, efforts must be redirected for network members to work together to define the approach to specific classes of integration for the long term [74].<br><br>Conclusion
This study tried to portray and trace how the facility <span class="yellow">participants</span> were involved in the Taiwan PCCNs. It was found that Taiwan PCCNs' members had higher involvement in the governance infrastructure, which was usually viewed as the most important for establishment of core values in PCCNs' organization design and management. There existed a higher extent of integration of clinical, marketing, and information infrastructures among the hospital-clinic member relationship than those among clinic members within individual PCCNs. The financial infrastructure was shown the least integrated relative to other functional infrastructures at the early stage of PCCN formation. Page [43] argued that networks form and grow for various reasons, however, only some of them could be compatible with the iterative processes of collaboration. Some <span class="yellow">participants</span> in the PCCNs may simply seek short-term economic gains and have little interest in joint learning and continuous improvement. From an organizational design perspective, the old phrase proposed by the wisdom of the saying about developing the integrated organizations (networks) should be – "coming together is the beginning, and working together is the success." Page [43] examined the virtual provider organizations such as physician-hospital organizations and pointed out the issue of the provider attitudes and behaviors as the critically successful continuous improvements in the health care environments. A wide variance of degree of network integration in Taiwan PCCNs still leaves room to improve.
In this study, the thoroughly surveyed items, that is, the potential network design content, were employed. In addition to provide how the network members have done their initial work at the early stage of network forming in this study, the detailed surveyed items, the concepts proposed by the managerial and theoretical professionals, could be also a guide for those health care providers who have a willingness to join multi-organizations. It suggests that health care providers could take more detailed looks about those surveyed items and give some possible opportunities to create the potential actions. Further research could be empirically done to explore the relative influence of these integration mechanisms on the effectiveness of organizational partnerships.
The partnerships within each PCCN represent various relationships that depend on how much the members are engaged in the projects. In addition to the macro concepts including governance, clinical, marketing, financial, and information infrastructures explored in this study, other managerial issues for integrated organizations were also suggested such as formation of an integrated cultural atmosphere, <span class="yellow">human</span> resources management, physician involvement, mission and commitment establishment, from micro organizational behavior perspective [30-32,34,36,75,76]. Micro managerial and longitudinal research designs could be employed to more precisely catch the never completing integration efforts in the future.<br><br>Abbreviations

Abstract
Introduction
Phendimetrazine is a medication currently being used to help <span class="yellow">patients</span> with weight loss. It shares a chemical structure with amphetamines. As such, it shares some of the same toxicities, which can include cardiac toxicity. This case highlights this principle.<br><br>Case presentation
a 54 year old Caucasian female presented to our urgent care facility with complaints of chest pains and other symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. Ultimately, she was transferred to the emergency room. After evaluation there, it appeared she was having demand ischemia from prescription diet pills<br><br>Conclusion
This case report demonstrates the potential dangers of amphetamine based diet pills. There have been other cases of cardiomyopathies related to phendimetrazine, but it is something that is rarely recognized in an outpatient setting. A case such as this demonstrates the importance of obtaining a careful medication history in all <span class="yellow">patients</span> and in recognizing diet pills with an amphetamine base can cause cardiac toxicity.<br><br><br><br>Case presentation
A 54 year-old Caucasian female presented to our urgent care facility complaining of nausea and vomiting, sense of impending doom and vague chest pain radiating toward her left side for about five hours. She never had similar symptoms in the past. She also denied anything that could have precipitated these symptoms. Her only past medical history was significant for spina bifida. Her medications included occasional Fiorinal (unknown dose), Xanax 0.5 mg as needed, and Phendimetrazine (unclear dose). Her social history was significant for smoking 1/2 pack per day cigarette use. She denied alcohol use. Family history was non contributory. She worked from home. Her physical exam showed a tachycardia of around 100 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16, temperature of 98.1, and O2 saturation of 100% on room air. She was approximately 5'7" and 145 pounds. In general, she was an anxious appearing, diaphoretic <span class="yellow">woman</span> in moderate distress, she had no elevated JVD at 30 degrees, her heart was tachycardic, but otherwise without murmur, gallops, or rubs, her lungs were clear, abdomen soft, and she had no peripheral edema. An EKG was checked which appears below (figure 1). After examination, there was concern for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). She was given nitroglycerin with relief of her chest discomfort. She was also given aspirin to chew. EMS was called and she was transferred to a local emergency room. She was hospitalized there for three days and after her discharge, we got permission from her to request records. While hospitalized, she was ruled out for ACS with negative troponins. She was also given beta blockade which resolved her tachycardia and her T wave changes on EKG. The next morning, she had an adenosine stress test which revealed normal uptake with no areas of ischemia and an ejection fraction of 55%. She was monitored for one more day and then discharged with instructions to discontinue her diet pills.<br><br>Discussion
Phendimetrazine is a medication currently being used for weight loss, with potential for illicit use. It has a similar chemical composition of amphetamines, which is thought to account for its clinical actions [1]. Amphetamines are well recognized as an etiology of cardiac ischemia, however phendimetrazine is more rarely described in the literature as causing cardiac events. [2,3]. Acute effects include hyperpyrexia, mydriasis, chest pain, arrhytmias, delirium, and, rhabdomylosis, among others [2]. Long term use has been associated with dilated cardiomyopathies, some of which have resolved with discontinuation of the medication [3]. In this particular case, it appears she may have developed a demand ischemia from the medication. It is not known how much of the drug she was taking. Initially, she was resistant to accepting that phendimetrazine could induce side effects, and there was suspicion that she could have been taking more of the drug that recommended. In addition, she was not prescribed the medication and would not admit to where she obtained it. As the public seems to have more focus on using medications to induce weight loss, this may be a more recognized complication and heart conditions should likely be monitored prior to starting amphetamine based weight loss pills.<br><br>Conclusion
Due to potentially detrimental effects of this medication, phendimetrazine should be used cautiously in many situations. As it shares its chemical structure with amphetamines, it also shares many of the side effects and the potential for abuse/addiction. There have been other reports in literature describing adverse outcomes from phendimetrazine as well as other weight loss medications. Therefore, cautious use is warranted.<br><br>Abbreviations

<h3>pmcA2599109</h3>Suggestions Concerning the Use of the Subclavian which Arises from the Aorta in the Treatment of the Tetralogy of Fallot *
Abstract
Images<br><br><br><br><br><br>
 SUGGESTIONS CONCERNING THE USE OF THE SUBCLAVIAN <br><br> WHICH ARISES FROM THE AORTA IN THE TREATMENT <br><br> OF THE TETRALOGY OF FALLOT* <br><br> HARRIS B. SHUMACKER, JR.** <br><br> In Blalock's early experience with the operative treatment of the tetralogy of Fallot, the two subclavian, the innominate, and carotid arteries were all used for anastomosis to the pulmonary artery. Soon, however, it became evident that use of the innominate or carotid was followed by a relatively high incidence of complications resulting from cerebral ischemia. Blalock suggested, therefore, that the subclavian be used by preference. The subclavian branch of the innominate does not become kinked or badly angulated when it is turned down for the anastomosis, and a good functional result almost invariably follows the completion of a satisfactory anastomosis. The subclavian which arises directly from the aorta, on the other hand, tends to form a bad angle when it is brought down for the anastomosis, and, indeed, near its point of origin it may be so flattened out against the relatively rigid aortic wall as to obstruct all blood flow through it. These considerations led Blalock to recommend the use of the former except in <span class="yellow">infants</span> under two years of age in whom this artery may be too small and in adults or <span class="yellow">children</span> over twelve years old or five feet tall with a left aortic arch in whom it is often too short to permit a satisfactory anastomosis.7' <br><br> In contrast, Paine and Varco,' Lam,6 Holman,' Olim,7 and others have preferred to use the subclavian which arises from the aorta and have obtained generally excellent results. They point out that the tendency to kinking of the artery is more a theoretical than a practical disadvantage, that the exposure and dissection of both the pulmonary artery and the subclavian are easier on the side of the aortic arch, that both vessels are generally longer than on the opposite side and that, as a general rule, the anastomosis can be accomplished more readily. The practical usefulness of a third systemic vessel, namely the aorta, was demonstrated by the development of a technique for side-to-side aortic pulmonary anastomosis by Potts and his associates."0 In spite of the preferences held by individual operators for use of one vessel or another, the fact remains, as Blalock has emphasized, that there is always present a usable systemic vessel provided a suitable pulmonary artery is available. Nevertheless, the choice of the systemic artery in each individual <span class="blue">patient</span> is important since in certain cases one or another is unsuitable. <br><br> * From the Department of Surgery, the Indiana University Medical Center, Indianapolis, Indiana. Aided by a contract between the Office of Naval Research, Department of the Navy, and Indiana University. <br><br> ** Resident Surgeon, New Haven Hospital, 1937-1938. Received for publication April 26, 1951. <br><br> TREATMENT OF TETRALOGY OF FALLOT <br><br> It has been my custom to follow a policy rather similar to that outlined by Blalock. The subclavian branch of the innominate has generally been preferred in <span class="yellow">patients</span> ranging between two and twelve years of age and in older individuals in whom there is a right aortic arch. In others the thoracotomy is usually made on the side of the aortic arch, and either the aorta itself or the subclavian arising from the aorta is used for the anastomosis. My experience with the use of the subclavian originating from the aorta is small and the results have not been as good as those which others have reported. One eighteen-month-old <span class="yellow">child</span> died the day after operation and was found at post-mortem examination to have an occluded anastomosis. In one three-year-old <span class="yellow">child</span> and one twenty-year-old <span class="yellow">woman</span> a poor result was obtained and a second operation upon the other side was necessary. In two additional cases the result was only fair. Excluding the <span class="yellow">patients</span> mentioned in the present report, only in two was an unquestionably good result obtained. <br><br> Recently, in several cases in which failure seemed evident a modification has been required in order to obtain a functioning shunt. Since these modifications proved successful and since these threats of failure tax one's ingenuiity at the time of operation, I have thought it might be helpful to describe the procedures employed and to illustrate them with case reports. One is a method which obviously has very limited applicability, while the otlher would seem to be rather generally applicable. <br><br> The first consists of the transplantation of the origin of the subclavian to a more suitable portion of the aorta. <br><br> Case report <br><br> The <span class="blue">patient</span> was a 19-year-old <span class="yellow">girl</span> who had been cyanotic since the age of six months. She had developed normally but was always limited in exercise capacity. In her early years of school she was taken to school by her parents and carried to and from her seat in the classroom. She did reasonably well in high school, being driven to and from the school, but she got into severe difficulty when she attempted to attend college. The longer distances between classes and the necessity for climbing stairs precipitated a downhill course, with increasing dyspnea, more marked cyanosis and fatigue, and the onset of bouts of loss of consciousness. The latter occurred several times daily. One which was witnessed by her physician lasted 45 minutes; he feared it would prove fatal. Ordinarily, she could not walk more than half a block. <br><br> There was marked cyanosis of the nails and mucous membranes and to a lesser extent of the skin. Clubbing was very prominent. All the results of physical and laboratory examination fitted in with a diagnosis of tetralogy of Fallot. The hematocrit ranged between 83 and 90. Oxygen saturation of arterial blood was 65 per cent at complete rest. The aortic arch was on the left side. On October 26, 1949 a left lateral thoracotomy was performed, the pleural cavity being entered through the bed of the fifth rib. There was evident greatly increased collateral circulation in the mediastinum and hilum. The pulmonary artery appeared to have markedly reduced blood flow, was very short, small, and thin-walled. Its diameter was less than 5 mm. The aorta seemed to be bowed out laterally in an unusual fashion and the short pulmonary artery could not possibly be brought out over it. The subclavian artery was relatively small, having <br><br> 487 <br><br> YALE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE <br><br> a diameter of only about 4 mm. but it seemed rather long. It was apparent that a Pott's procedure was impossible and that an end-to-side subclavian pulmonary artery anastomosis would be doomed to failure. Hence, the subclavian artery was divided at the level of its first branch, the pulmonary artery was divided proximally, and an end-to-end subclavian-pulmonary anastomosis was carried out. This was done with ease. When the clamps were removed, however, no blood flowed through it. The softwalled subclavian was completely flattened out against the relatively rigid aorta (Fig. 1). When the hilar structures were forcibly elevated in a cephalad direction the subclavian immediately filled and pulsated normally and a thrill could be felt. Simple expansion of the lungs, however, failed to achieve this result and I could conceive of no way in which the hilar region could be held in a more cephalad direction. The subclavian was then ligated at the point where it came off the aorta and its proximal end was anastomosed end-to-side to the descending aorta. It now pulsated vigorously as did the pulmonary artery. In spite of the good pulsation no thrill was palpable. The <span class="blue">patient</span> had an uneventful but disappointing convalescence. She remained markedly cyanotic and no continuous bruit was audible. When she left the hospital 14 days after operation there was no improvement in her appearance, hematocrit, or arterial oxygen saturation. <br><br> Surprisingly enough she reported progress on each follow-up examination. By the end of seven weeks she was obviously less cyanotic, her hematocrit was 77, and she was able to walk a number of blocks and to climb a flight of stairs without difficulty. She reported that she had danced and roller-skated without much trouble. Shortly thereafter a continuous murmur was audible in the left chest. She continued to improve and in January entered a southern college. She did well. At least once a day, often twice, she walked without difficulty from the campus into town and back, a distance of ten blocks each way. She played a little tennis, learned to swim, and began to dance, including jitterbugging. When she xvas seen in June, her color was good, although there was still slight cyanosis of lips and nail beds. There was a very loud, continuous murmur in the left chest. The following fall she transferred to a midwestern university. She got along reasonably well but not as well as she had in a warmer climate and on more level terrain. She walked four or five blocks up and down hills between classes without difficulty in good weather but complained of some dyspnea and fatigue on cold, windy days. She attended dances and often danced each number throughout the evening without trouble. When seen in December she looked well. Her color was good and clubbing was definitely less marked than it had been previously. She had a severe cold at the time. Her oxygen saturation of arterial blood was 75 per cent at rest and it did not fall when she stood or still-walked. The hematocrit was 69. There was audible the same loud continuous murmur in the left chest. <br><br> Though the <span class="blue">patient</span> has been markedly improved, it is recognized that the result is not as good as is commonly obtained when <span class="yellow">patients</span> with more adequate pulmonary arteries are treated by the conventional anastomosis of a systemic artery to the side of the pulmonary artery. Nevertheless, the <span class="blue">patient</span> has thus far been given such good health and relatively normal capacity for ordinary activity that further operation has seemed unwarranted, though the possibility of some future attempt at creation of an additional shunt is being kept in mind. <br><br> The second procedure embodies the cephalad transplantation of the pulmonary artery by a plastic repair of the incision in the hilar and mediastinal pleural structures. <br><br> 488 <br><br> FIG. 1. Drawing illustrating the condition which existed in the first case after completion of the anastomosis (A) and its correction by transplantation of the origin of the subclavian (B). <br><br> FIG. 2. Drawing illustrating correction of obstruction to blood flow through the subclavian artery by inverted T or L plastic closure of the defect in the hilar and mediastinal structures. <br><br> TREATMENT OF TETRALOGY OF FALLOT <br><br> Case reports <br><br> The first <span class="blue">patient</span> was a fully grown young <span class="yellow">man</span> of 17 with tetralogy of Fallot which caused considerable incapacity. He was admitted to the hospital on July 18, 1950 and was operated upon two days later. He was known to have a left aortic arch, and a left lateral thoracotomy was performed. The aorta was freed for a side-to-side anastomosis with the pulmonary artery. So much difficulty was encountered, however, in placing the aortic clamp in proper position for making a satisfactory incision in the aorta that the procedure was abandoned and an end-to-side subclavian-pulmonary artery anastomosis accomplished instead. The pulmonary artery was of fair size, having an estimated diameter of 1 cm. The subclavian artery appeared to be quite long and it was of very satisfactory size, having a diameter of about 6 mm. To my dismay, the first portion of the soft-walled subclavian artery was completely flattened out against the rather rigid wall of the aorta and no blood flow through it could be demonstrated, there being no subclavian pulsation nor thrill in the pulmonary artery. If one forcefully elevated the hilum of the lung in a cephalad direction, the obstruction disappeared, the subclavian artery began to pulsate, and a thrill could be palpated. When the lung was allowed to assume its usual position, the subclavian obstruction was again evident and could not be prevented by full expansion of the lung. It was found that the hilar region and the pulmonary artery could be maintained in a satisfactory cephalad position by traction upward upon the cuff of hilar pleura and the adjacent vascular sheath and that these structures were sufficiently strong so that traction could be maintained upon them with a small hemostat. The defect in the mediastinal and hilar tissues was then repaired using a sort of inverted T-plastic closure. By this maneuver success was achieved in elevating the pulmonary artery in a cephalad direction so that the subclavian obstruction was relieved and excellent pulsation was evident (Fig. 2B). A fairly good continuous thrill was palpable. The <span class="blue">patient</span> had an uneventful convalescence. When last seen on January 16, 1951 he had excellent color without any visible cyanosis. The clubbing seemed to have decreased somewhat. A continuous murmur was audible. He stated that he noted no limitation of exercise capacity. In outlining his activities he said that, among other things, he was doing a great deal of ice-skating and was playing ice hockey regularly. He was planning to start college work the following month. <br><br> The second <span class="blue">patient</span> was a 16-year-old <span class="yellow">boy</span> who had been cyanotic since birth. His physical development was somewhat retarded and he was slow in learning to sit and walk. Until he had grown old enough to be self-conscious about it he had always squatted when he was tired. By perseverance he had managed to do more than one would have suspected he could from the degree of his cyanosis. He could walk as much as five or six blocks at a slow pace. He was fond of drums and managed to play occasionally with an orchestra in a somewhat restricted fashion. For the past few months he had had more dyspnea, fatigability, and seemed to be going downhill generally. <br><br> The results of physical and laboratory studies were rather typical of the tetralogy of Fallot. Clubbing was marked, the nailbeds and mucous membranes were a rather deep purplish-blue color, and the skin had a dusky cyanotic tint. The aortic arch was determined to be on the left. On July 21, 1950 a left lateral thoracotomy was performed, the pleural cavity being entered through the bed of the fourth rib. There was a rather marked increase in the collateral circulation in the mediastinum and the hilar region. The pulmonary artery was easily dissected free. It was fairly long and was about 1 cm. in diameter. The subclavian artery seemed quite long and was of adequate size, having a diameter of about 5 mm. An end-to-side sub9lavian pulmonary anastomosis was performed. Again in this case, however, the first part of the subclavian was acutely angulated and completely flattened out against the aortic wall. There was no <br><br> 489 <br><br> YALE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE <br><br> pulsation in the subclavian and no thrill in the pulmonary. In this instance also, good blood flow through the subclavian artery was evident whenever the hilar structures were elevated in a cephalad direction but no pulsation was demonstrable simply by expanding fully the lung. Again, a sort of inverted T-plastic closure of the defect in the hilum and mediastinum brought about a cephalad elevation of the pulmonary artery so that tension was released and there was excellent pulsation in the subclavian artery. A thrill was now palpable. Convalescence was uneventful. Improvement in color was evident within a few days and his color was excellent by the time he was discharged from the hospital on the thirteenth postoperative day. He rapidly found that he was now able to lead a quite normal sort of life. When he was seen on December 9 he stated that he had no limitation in exercise capacity. He could walk rapidly without fatigue. He was going to school and was playing the drums in a professional orchestra three or four nights each week. There was some diminution in the clubbing and his color was excellent. There was a loud continuous bruit audible in the chest. On March 27 the arterial oxygen saturation was 88.2 per cent. <br><br> When I first used this procedure I was rather surprised that such tissues would hold sutures and serve satisfactorily to elevate the hilum. On occasions I had previously toyed with the idea of suturing hilar pleura to the mediastinal pleura but had abandoned it as impractical because the sutures seemed to pull out whenever there was any tension whatsoever. If the procedure is to be successful, it is essential that the sutures encompass any adjacent areolar and fibrous tissue and especially the so-called vascular sheath which surrounds both pulmonary artery and aorta and is dissected free during the course of the operation. Fortunately, in its proximal portion the sheath about the pulmonary artery gains added strength from the extension into it of a reflection of the fibrous pericardium. Sutures through the mediastinal pleura in the region of the aortic arch purposely include the perivascular tissues which have been stripped off the aorta and subclavian artery and also any other available tissue which may lend strength, such as the divided ends of the supreme intercostal vein or other vessels which lhave been transected and ligated. The exact method of repair will vary from case to case. By placing the sutures properly it would seem possible sometimes to displace the pulmonary artery laterally as well as in a cephalad direction if such a maneuver was thought to be desirable (Fig. 2C). On occasions one would close the pleural defect fairly snugly, on others leave it wide open in places. <br><br> Discussion <br><br> Though there is always available some suitable systemic vessel and though the major concern in the operative treatment of the tetralogy of Fallot is the adequacy of the pulmonary artery, from time to time one may find the achievement of a satisfactory result thwarted by the local anatomical characteristics regardless of one's choice of procedure. Consequently, those modifications which may add to the likelihood of a successful outcome are important. Blalock"' pointed out the practicability of performing an end-toend subclavian-pulmonary artery anastomosis whenever the pulmonary artery is judged too small or the subclavian too short for a satisfactory end<br><br> 490 <br><br> TREATMENT OF TETRALOGY OF FALLOT             491 <br><br> to-side anastomosis. Holman' feels that a poorly functioning shunt after end-to-side anastomosis can usually be corrected by proximal division of the subclavian artery, thus in effect converting the procedure into an end-to-end anastomosis. If a satisfactory end-to-side suture of subclavian and pulmonary arteries or side-to-side aortic pulmonary anastomosis seems difficult to achieve, one may occasionally find it useful to divide the upper lobe branch of the pulmonary artery and carry out an end-to-end suture of the subclavian and the proximal end of the upper lobe branch. Potts and Smith' performed an anastomosis between the proximal end of the upper lobe branch and the side of the aorta in a case in which complete temporary occlusion of the main pulmonary artery was withstood poorly. I have found this principle of division of the upper lobe branch and use of its proximal end of value in obtaining a suitable subclavian pulmonary anastomosis when the subclavian seemed to have inadequate length. On occasions when the systemic vessel seems too short, one may elect to interpose a free vascular transplant,3"' a modification I first employed in 1946 though unfortunately not with success in this instance. <br><br> The operation performed in my first <span class="blue">patient</span> constitutes in reality the use of the subclavian artery as an autogenous graft between the aorta and pulmonary artery. It will obviously not often be the procedure of choice but sometimes may be found a useful measure in converting an apparently inadequate functional shunt into a good one. If my initial experiences with the plastic repair of the defect in the mediastinal and hilar structures are characteristic of what may be expected of this procedure, it would seem to have wide applicability whenever a poorly functioning subclavian-pulmonary shunt seems correctable by cephalad transplantation of the hilar structures and the consequent release of tension. I was unaware of any reference in the literature to its use until belatedly I discovered that I had overlooked a statement in the legend of one of the excellent drawings in Blalock's paper on surgical procedures in pulmonic stenosis.' Here he states that suture of the pleura of the superior aspect of the hilum to the mediastinal pleura may effectively elevate a little the pulmonary artery. Perhaps our more detailed consideration of this maneuver may add to its general usefulness. <br><br> REFERENCES <br><br> 1 Blalock, A.: The technique of creation of an artificial ductus arteriosus in the <br><br> treatment of pulmonic stenosis.

Abstract
Background
Osteoarthritis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint (MPJ) of the foot, termed hallux limitus, is common and painful. Numerous non-surgical interventions have been proposed for this disorder, however there is limited evidence for their efficacy. Intra-articular injections of hyaluronan have shown beneficial effects in case-series and clinical trials for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. However, no study has evaluated the efficacy of this form of treatment using a randomised placebo controlled trial. This article describes the design of a randomised placebo controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of intra-articular hyaluronan (Synvisc®) to reduce pain and improve function in <span class="yellow">people</span> with hallux limitus.<br><br>Methods
One hundred and fifty community-dwelling <span class="yellow">men</span> and <span class="yellow">women</span> aged 18 years and over with hallux limitus (who satisfy inclusion and exclusion criteria) will be recruited.
<span class="yellow">Participants</span> will be randomised, using a computer-generated random number sequence, to receive a single intra-articular injection of up to 1 ml hyaluronan (Synvisc®) or sterile saline (placebo) into the first MPJ. The injections will be performed by an interventional radiologist using fluoroscopy to ensure accurate deposition of the hyaluronan in the joint. <span class="yellow">Participants</span> will be given the option of a second and final intra-articular injection (of Synvisc® or sterile saline according to the treatment group they are in) either 1 or 3 months post-treatment if there is no improvement in pain and the <span class="yellow">participant</span> has not experienced severe adverse effects after the first injection. The primary outcome measures will be the pain and function subscales of the Foot Health Status Questionnaire. The secondary outcome measures will be pain at the first MPJ (during walking and at rest), stiffness at the first MPJ, passive non-weightbearing dorsiflexion of the first MPJ, plantar flexion strength of the toe-flexors of the hallux, global satisfaction with the treatment, health-related quality of life (assessed using the Short-Form-36 version two questionnaire), magnitude of symptom change, use of pain-relieving medication and changes in dynamic plantar pressure distribution (maximum force and peak pressure) during walking. Data will be collected at baseline, then 1, 3 and 6 months post-treatment. Data will be analysed using the intention to treat principle.<br><br>Discussion
This study is the first randomised placebo controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of intra-articular hyaluronan (Synvisc®) for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the first MPJ (hallux limitus). The study has been pragmatically designed to ensure that the study findings can be implemented into clinical practice if this form of treatment is found to be an effective treatment strategy.<br><br>Trial registration

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease that commonly presents within the first metatarsophalangeal joint (MPJ) of the foot. The terms hallux limitus and hallux rigidus have frequently been used interchangeably to describe differing severities of pain and limitation of motion associated with OA at the first MPJ [1]. Hallux limitus is a progressive osteoarthritic condition of the first MPJ that may advance to an end-stage presentation of hallux rigidus where the joint fuses and there is a complete restriction of motion [1]. First MPJ OA is the second most common disorder affecting the foot after hallux valgus [2]. The prevalence of the condition increases with age, and it has been reported that radiographic changes in the first MPJ affect are evident in approximately 46% of <span class="yellow">women</span> and 32% of <span class="yellow">men</span> at 60 years of age [3]. Osteoarthritis at the first MPJ is characterised by the symptoms of pain and stiffness at the joint [1]. Secondary painful symptoms relate to compensations during gait that may occur due to the reduced motion of the first MPJ [1]. The presence of pain associated with first MPJ OA impacts on normal walking and quality of life [4].
Treatment of hallux limitus involves conservative measures (such as physical therapy, foot orthoses, footwear modification, joint manipulation and injection with corticosteroid) [5], or surgical intervention (either joint-salvage or joint-destructive procedures) [6]. Pharmacological treatment is also often undertaken as an adjunct for pain relief in the management of hallux limitus [6]. However, although non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors have been found to be effective in the management of various forms of OA, gastrointestinal complications remain a concern [7]. In light of these limitations with existing treatments, an alternative treatment termed 'viscosupplementation' – the intra-articular injection of hyaluronan into arthritic joints with the aim of restoring the viscoelasticity of the synovial fluid [8] – has been proposed and has attracted considerable attention in the medical literature as a treatment for OA [9]. In particular, both the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommend hyaluronan in the management of OA of the knee [10,11]. Although the results of systematic reviews investigating the effectiveness of this type of treatment for knee OA are controversial, the most recent update of the Cochrane systematic review evaluating viscosupplementation for the treatment of knee OA concluded that viscosupplementation was both safe and effective for the treatment of OA and was superior or equivalent to any form of systemic intervention or intra-articular corticosteroids [9,12].
Despite there being a large number of studies investigating the effectiveness of hyaluronan for knee OA, few studies have investigated the effects of this form of treatment for OA at the first MPJ [13]. In a case-series retrospective study, 14 <span class="yellow">patients</span> with radiographically confirmed OA at the first MPJ that received up to 3 intra-articular injections of 1 ml hyaluronan (Ostenil® Mini) (sodium hyaluronate) reported a statistically significant reduction in pain (reported using a visual analogue scale) after 6 months [14]. The treatment was well tolerated, with 3/14 (21%) <span class="yellow">participants</span> reporting mild adverse reactions at the injection site. In another study, Pons et al[13] compared a single intra-articular injection of 1 ml Ostenil® Mini (sodium hyaluronate) with 1 ml Trigon depot® (triamcinolone acetonide, a corticosteroid) for the treatment of painful, grade 1 hallux limitus (Karasick and Wapner [15] scale) in 37 <span class="yellow">participants</span> (40 feet) [13]. Both treatment groups showed statistically significant reductions in pain at rest or on palpation for up to 12 weeks post-injection. However, hyaluronan treatment resulted in a statistically significant greater reduction in pain during walking and greater improvement in the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hallux MPJ score compared to treatment with triamcinolone acetonide. The treatment with hyaluronan was well tolerated, with 2/20 (10%) <span class="yellow">participants</span> reporting mild adverse reactions at the injection site.
Although both of these studies suggest that intra-articular hyaluronan is safe and effective for the treatment of hallux limitus, neither used a placebo control group [13,14]. This limitation is significant as a placebo effect can account for 79% of the efficacy of intra-articular hyaluronan treatment [16]. Further, both studies are limited in that neither of the studies used blinding of both the <span class="yellow">participants</span> and assessors in their protocols. It is therefore possible that the positive effects of hyaluronan may have been overestimated. Accordingly, the aims of this project are to conduct a double blind randomised controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of intra-articular hyaluronan (Synvisc®) on (i) foot pain and function; (ii) the range of motion of the first MPJ; (iii) the strength of the plantarflexor muscles of the first MPJ; (iv) the health related quality of life; and (v) the use of pain-relieving medications in <span class="yellow">people</span> with hallux limitus. The study protocol is presented in this paper, consistent with the recommendations of Editorial Board of BioMed Central [17].<br><br>Methods
Design
This study is a parallel group, <span class="yellow">participant</span> and assessor blinded, randomised controlled trial with a 6 month follow-up (Figure 1). It has been developed using the principles described by Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) Clinical Trials Task Force guidelines [18]. <span class="yellow">Participants</span> will be randomised to receive a single intra-articular injection of up to 1 ml hyaluronan (Synvisc®) or sterile saline (placebo) into the first MPJ. Allocation to either the Synvisc® or placebo groups will be achieved using a computer-generated random number sequence. The allocation sequence will be generated and held by an external <span class="yellow">person</span> not directly involved in the trial. Concealment of the allocation sequence will be ensured as each <span class="yellow">participant</span>'s allocation will be contained in a sealed opaque envelope. Envelopes will be made opaque by using a sheet of aluminium foil inside the envelope. In addition, a system using carbon paper will be employed so the details (name and date of recruitment) are transferred from the outside of the envelope to the paper inside the envelope containing the allocation prior to opening the seal. Assessors and <span class="yellow">participants</span> will be blinded to group allocation. <span class="yellow">Participants</span> will be given the option of a second and final intra-articular injection (of Synvisc® or sterile saline according to the treatment group they are in) on days 30 or 90 if there is no improvement in pain and the <span class="yellow">participant</span> has not experienced severe adverse effects after the first injection).<br><br><span class="yellow">Participants</span>

<span class="yellow">Participants</span> will be randomised to receive a single intra-articular injection of up to 1 ml of hyaluronan (Synvisc®; Genzyme Biosurgery, Genzyme Corporation, NJ, USA) or sterile saline (placebo) into the first MPJ. Each 2 ml ampoule of Synvisc® contains 16 mg of hylan G-F 20 (cross-linked hylan polymers; hylan A and B), 17 mg sodium chloride, 0.32 mg disodium hydrogen phosphate, 0.08 mg sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate. The hyaluronan is extracted from <span class="yellow">chicken</span> combs and the purified material has an average molecular weight of 6,000 kDa.
The injections will be performed by the same experienced interventional radiologist (AEZ) using fluoroscopic imaging to ensure accurate deposition of the hyaluronan within the joint. As the Synvisc® is provided in ampoules that are labelled with the product name, it will not be possible to blind the injector, however this <span class="yellow">person</span> is not involved in generation of the allocation order, recruitment, assessment or data analysis. The intra-articular injection will be performed using a 21 gauge (0.80 × 19 mm) Surflo® (Terumo® Corp., Tokyo, Japan) winged infusion set under aseptic procedures. Either a dorso-lateral or dorso-medial approach for injection will be used at the discretion of the injector (depending on which approach provides minimum interference from the osteophytes at the first MPJ joint margins). No anaesthetic will be used. If the <span class="yellow">participant</span> has bilateral painful first MPJs, only one side (the most painful side) will be treated and used for data collection. The injector will record the volume of the agent that is injected.
<span class="yellow">Participants</span> will be given the option of a second and final intra-articular injection (of Synvisc® or sterile saline according to the treatment group they are in) on days 30 or 90 if there is no improvement in pain (assessed using the VAPS for pain during walking or at rest) and the <span class="yellow">participant</span> has not experienced severe adverse effects after the first injection).<br><br>Assessments
Initial assessments
An initial assessment will be performed to determine the eligibility of <span class="yellow">participants</span> for this study. Demographic data will be collected including the age, gender, height and weight of <span class="yellow">participants</span>. Data will also be obtained concerning the presentation of symptoms (foot affected, duration of symptoms). If the <span class="yellow">participant</span> has bilateral painful first MPJs, the most painful side will be used for data collection and subsequent treatment. To establish eligibility for the study, <span class="yellow">participants</span> will undergo a clinical assessment, have one set of dorso-plantar and lateral weight-bearing x-rays taken of their feet to grade the severity of first MPJ OA as well as undergo a blood test to assess serum uric acid levels (to exclude gout).
Weightbearing dorso-plantar and lateral radiographic views will be obtained from both feet with the <span class="yellow">participant</span> standing in a relaxed bipedal stance position. All x-rays will be taken by the same medical imaging department using a Shimadzu UD150LRII 50 kw/30 kHz Generator and 0.6/1.2 P18DE-80S high speed x-ray tube from a ceiling suspended tube mount. AGFA MD40 CR digital phosphor plates in a 24 cm × 30 cm cassette will be used. For dorso-plantar projections, the x-ray tube will be angled 15° cephalad and centered at the base of the third metatarsal. For lateral projections, the tube will be angled 90° and centered at the base of the third metatarsal. The film focus distance will be set at 100 cm [19].<br><br>Baseline assessments and outcome measures
<span class="yellow">Participants</span> who are eligible for the study will be invited to attend a baseline assessment. During the baseline assessment, <span class="yellow">participants</span> will undergo primary and secondary outcome measurements prior to receiving their injection. The outcome measurements have been developed in accordance of the recommendations of the OARSI Clinical Trials Task Force guidelines [18].<br><br>Primary outcome measures
Outcome measurements (primary and secondary) will occur at four time-points at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months post-treatment (after the intra-articular injection of Synvisc® or placebo). The assessor performing the measurements will be blinded as to which treatment group <span class="yellow">participants</span> have been allocated to. <span class="yellow">Participants</span> who receive a second treatment at day 30 or 90 will be followed for a further 30 days or 90 days respectively and undergo outcome measurements at 7 or 9 months respectively.
The primary outcome measures will be the Pain and Function subscales of the Foot Health Status Questionnaire (FHSQ) [24]. The FHSQ includes 13 questions that assess four domains of foot health, Foot pain, Foot function, Footwear and General foot health. The FHSQ has been subjected to an extensive validation (content, criterion and construct validity) process. It has a high test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.74 to 0.92) and a high degree of internal consistency (Cronbach's α ranging from 0.85 to 0.88) [24]. Rigorous reviews have rated it as one of the highest quality foot health status measures currently available [25-27].<br><br>Secondary outcome measures
The secondary outcome measures will be:
(i) Severity of pain
Severity of pain at the first MPJ during walking, and during rest, over the past week will be assessed using a 100 mm visual analogue pain scale. The left side of the scale (0 mm) will be labelled "no pain" and the right side of the scale (100 mm) will be labelled "worst pain possible" for each question [25,28].<br><br>(ii) Severity and duration of stiffness at the first metatarsophalangeal joint
The severity of stiffness at the first MPJ during walking over the past week will be assessed using a 100 mm visual analogue scale. The left side of the scale (0 mm) will be labelled "not stiff at all" and the right side of the scale (100 mm) will be labelled "most stiff possible". The average duration of stiffness at the first MPJ over the past week will be assessed using a four category scale response. The responses are: "none", "1–15 minutes", "16–30 minutes" and "greater than 30 minutes" [29].<br><br>(iii) Passive, non-weightbearing dorsiflexion range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint
First MPJ dorsiflexion range of motion will be measured using a goniometer as the maximum angle at which the hallux cannot be passively moved into further extension in a non-weightbearing position (Figure 2) [30]. The test will be performed two times and the average will be used for analysis. This measurement technique shows high intra-reliability (ICC = 0.95, standard error of mean = 1.3°) [30].<br><br>(iv) Plantar flexion strength of the toe-flexors of the hallux
Plantar flexion strength of the toe-flexors of the hallux will be measured using the Mat Scan® plantar pressure measurement device [31]. <span class="yellow">Participants</span> will be seated with the hip, knee, and ankle at 90 degrees and their foot placed over the Mat Scan® plantar pressure measurement device (Tekscan, Boston, MA, USA) (Figure 3a). This system consists of a 5-mm thick floor mat (432 × 368 mm) incorporating 2288 resistive sensors (1.4 sensors/cm2) sampling at a rate of 40 Hz. The mat will be calibrated for each <span class="yellow">participant</span> using his or her own bodyweight before each testing session. <span class="yellow">Participants</span> will be instructed to use their toe-flexor muscles to maximally push their hallux down on the MatScan® device and forces under the hallux will be recorded (Figure 3b). The test will be performed three times for the hallux and the maximal force will be used for analysis. The test-retest reliability of this measurement technique has previously been shown to be high, with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) = 0.88 (95% CI 0.81 – 0.93) [31].<br><br>(vi) Plantar pressure measurement
Plantar pressures will be recorded during level barefoot walking using the MatScan® system (Tekscan®, Boston, MA, USA). The two-step gait initiation protocol will be used to obtain foot pressure data, as it requires fewer trials than the mid-gait protocol and has similar re-test reliability [32]. Three trials will be recorded, which has been found to be sufficient to ensure adequate reliability of pressure data [32,33]. Following data collection, the Research Foot® software (version 5.24) will be used to construct individual "masks" to determine maximum force (kg) and peak pressure (kg/cm2) under seven regions of the foot: hallux, lesser toes, 1st MPJ, 2nd MPJ, 3rd to 5th MPJs, midfoot and heel (Figure 4a). For each region, the median of the three trials will be used for analysis. Typical plantar pressure recordings from a <span class="yellow">participant</span> are shown in Figure 4b.<br><br>(vi) Global satisfaction with the treatment
Global satisfaction with the treatment will be assessed using a 5-point Likert scale, as well as a dichotomous (yes/no) scale. The five point-Likert scale will ask "How satisfied are you with the treatment you received for your big-toe joint pain?", and will have the following five responses: "Dissatisfied", "Only moderately satisfied", "Fairly satisfied", "Clearly satisfied" and "Very satisfied". The dichotomous scale of satisfaction will be answered as "Yes"' or "No" in response to the question: "Would you recommend the treatment that you received to someone else with big-toe joint pain".<br><br>(vii) Health related quality of life
The Short-Form-36 (version two) (SF-36) questionnaire will be used to assess health related quality of life. The SF-36 is a 36 question survey that measures eight health concepts most affected by disease and treatment. The eight health concepts can then be used to form two summary measures: Physical health and Mental health. The Short Form-36 (SF-36) has been extensively validated and is one of the most widely used instruments to measure health status. The SF-36 shows content, concurrent, criterion, construct, and predictive evidence of validity. The reliability of the eight concepts and two summary measures has been assessed using both internal consistency and test-retest methods. Reliability statistics have exceeded 0.80 [34-37].<br><br>(viii) Self-reported magnitude of symptom change
Self-reported magnitude of symptom change will be measured using a 15-point Likert scale. The scale will ask <span class="yellow">participants</span> "how much have your symptoms in your big-toe joint have changed from the beginning of the study to now?". The fifteen responses will range from "A very great deal better" to "A very great deal worse".<br><br>(ix) Use of rescue medications to relieve pain at the first metatarsophalangeal joint
The number of <span class="yellow">participants</span> who consumed rescue medication (e.g., paracetamol) and mean consumption of rescue medication to relieve pain at the first MPJ (mean grams of paracetamol/<span class="yellow">participant</span>/month] will be assessed using a medications diary that <span class="yellow">participants</span> will self-complete [38,39]. The diary will be returned to the assessor at monthly intervals for analysis.<br><br>(x) Frequency and severity of adverse events as safety variables
The frequency (number of <span class="yellow">participants</span> affected and number of cases) and types of adverse events (including adverse drug reactions) in each treatment group during the trial will be recorded using a questionnaire that <span class="yellow">participants</span> will complete during the follow-up appointments at 1, 3 and 6 months post-treatment [40]. To classify the 'type' of adverse event, a blinded assessor will classify the adverse event as being serious or non-serious [40]. Any serious adverse events, defined as adverse events leading to serious disability, hospital admission, or prolongation of hospitalisation, life-threatening events; or death) will be further classified using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes [41]. Non-serious adverse events will include both local (pain, effusion and heat, with each classified as mild, moderate, severe) and systemic adverse events. An open-response type format will also be available for <span class="yellow">participant</span> responses.<br><br><br><br>Sample size
The sample size for the study has been pre-specified using an a priori power analysis using the primary outcome measure of the pain domain of the FHSQ [42]. One hundred and forty two <span class="yellow">participants</span> (i.e. 71 per group) will provide power of 90% to detect a minimally important difference in the pain domain of the FHSQ (i.e. 14 points on the FHSQ questionnaire) with the significance level set at p < 0.05. A difference of 14 points was determined to be a clinically significant difference worth detecting [43] and a standard deviation of 25 was derived from a previous report [44]. This calculation included a 5% drop-out rate [13]. However, we will aim to recruit 150 <span class="yellow">participants</span> (~75 <span class="yellow">participants</span> per intervention group). Further, we have conservatively ignored the extra precision provided by covariate analysis when estimating the sample size.<br><br>Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis will be undertaken using SPSS version 14.0 (SPSS Corp, Chicago, Ill, USA) and STATA 8 (Stata Corp, College Station, Tex., USA) statistical software. All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat principle using all randomised <span class="yellow">participants</span> [45-47]. Missing data will be replaced with the last score carried forward [48]. Standard tests for normal distribution will be used and transformation carried out if required.
Demographic characteristics (gender, age, weight, height, body mass index) will be determined for the baseline visit for each treatment group. Summary statistics will be calculated for duration of symptoms, side affected (left, right, bilateral), grade of OA at the first MPJ [19] as well as all primary and secondary outcome measurements for each treatment group.
Analyses will be conducted on 1, 3 and 6 month outcome measures. The continuously-scored outcome measures at 1, 3 and 6 months will be compared using analysis of covariance with baseline scores and intervention group entered as independent variables [49,50]. The exception to this will be the plantar pressure measurements which will be analysed at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months using two-way repeated measures analysis of variance statistics. Post-hoc comparisons will be performed using Bonferroni-adjusted t-tests. Nominal and ordinal scaled data will be compared at 1, 3 and 6 months using Mann-Whitney U-tests and chi-square analyses (or Fisher's exact test where appropriate) respectively. Effect sizes will be determined using Cohen's d (continuous scaled data) or odds ratios (nominal scaled data and ordinal scaled data) as appropriate.
The outcome measurements obtained at 7 or 9 months for <span class="yellow">participants</span> that receive a second and final intra-articular injection (of Synvisc® or sterile saline according to the treatment group they are in) on days 30 or 90 respectively, will also be analysed as described above. These analyses will be classified as secondary outcomes.<br><br>
Discussion
This study is a randomised placebo controlled trial designed to investigate the efficacy of intra-articular hyaluronan (Synvisc®) to reduce pain and improve function in <span class="yellow">people</span> with OA of the first MPJ (hallux limitus). Two studies have previously investigated the efficacy of intra-articular hyaluronan for the treatment of first MPJ OA [13,14]. However, neither of these studies used a placebo control group. To our knowledge, this is the first randomised controlled trial using intra-articular hyaluronan for OA of the first MPJ.
The use of a placebo control group is essential for studies evaluating the effects of intra-articular therapies as there is likely to be a large placebo response related to the injection procedure and this may inflate the results in uncontrolled evaluations [51]. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis of hyaluronan for knee OA concluded that a placebo effect accounted for 79% of the efficacy of intra-articular hyaluronan [16].
The study protocol and outcome measures have been developed in accordance of the recommendations of the OARSI Clinical Trials Task Force guidelines [18]. The outcome measures are pain and function subscales of the FHSQ, pain and stiffness at the first MPJ, range of motion (dorsiflexion) of the first MPJ, plantar flexion strength of muscles of the first MPJ, generic health related quality of life (SF-36), <span class="blue">patient</span> satisfaction with treatment, consumption of rescue medication as well as frequency and nature of adverse effects. These outcomes will be measured at baseline then at 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment. Previous research suggests that the effects of intra-articular hyaluronan persist for up to 12 months following treatment [9,38]. Thus, the use of follow-up assessments at 6 month post-treatment will allow us to determine if the effects, if any, of intra-articular hyaluronan persist in the longer term.
<span class="yellow">Participants</span> will be given the option of a second and final intra-articular injection (of Synvisc® or sterile saline according to the treatment group they are in) on days 30 or 90 if there is no improvement in their symptoms. Although this has the potential to complicate the interpretation of the results of the study, this protocol was included as it is likely to be more reflective of clinical practice [14], and this is in keeping with the pragmatic nature of this trial.
In summary, this project is the first randomised controlled trial to be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of intra-articular hyaluronan for reducing pain and improving function in <span class="yellow">people</span> with hallux limitus. The study protocol, including interventions, have been pragmatically designed to ensure that the study findings are generaliseable to clinical practice. Recruitment for the study will commence in June 2008, and we expect final results to be available in mid-2010.<br><br>Competing interests

<h3>pmcA1590010</h3>Drug information resources used by nurse practitioners and collaborating physicians at the point of care in Nova Scotia, Canada: a survey and review of the literature
Abstract
Background
Keeping current with drug therapy information is challenging for health care practitioners. Technologies are often implemented to facilitate access to current and credible drug information sources. In the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, legislation was passed in 2002 to allow nurse practitioners (NPs) to practice collaboratively with physician partners. The purpose of this study was to determine the current utilization patterns of information technologies by these groups of practitioners.<br><br>Methods
Nurse practitioners and their collaborating physician partners in Nova Scotia were sent a survey in February 2005 to determine the frequency of use, usefulness, accessibility, credibility, and current/timeliness of personal digital assistant (PDA), computer, and print drug information resources. Two surveys were developed (one for PDA users and one for computer users) and revised based on a literature search, stakeholder consultation, and pilot-testing results. A second distribution to nonresponders occurred two weeks following the first. Data were entered and analysed with SPSS.<br><br>Results
Twenty-seven (14 NPs and 13 physicians) of 36 (75%) recipients responded. 22% (6) returned personal digital assistant (PDA) surveys. Respondents reported print, health professionals, and online/electronic resources as the most to least preferred means to access drug information, respectively. 37% and 35% of respondents reported using "both print and electronic but print more than electronic" and "print only", respectively, to search monograph-related drug information queries whereas 4% reported using "PDA only". Analysis of respondent ratings for all resources in the categories print,  health professionals and other, and online/electronic resources, indicated  that the Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties and pharmacists  ranked highly for frequency of use, usefulness, accessibility, credibility,  and current/timeliness by both groups of practitioners. Respondents' preferences and resource ratings were consistent with self-reported methods for conducting drug information queries. Few differences existed between NP and physician rankings of resources.<br><br>Conclusion
The use of computers and PDAs remains limited, which is also consistent with preferred and frequent use of print resources. Education for these practitioners regarding available electronic drug information resources may facilitate future computer and PDA use. Further research is needed to determine methods to increase computer and PDA use and whether these technologies affect prescribing and <span class="blue">patient</span> outcomes.<br><br><br><br>Background
Challenges with knowledge management for health care professionals
In 1986, Haynes et al. published a series of 6 articles entitled "how to keep up with the medical literature" in an effort to help clinicians with information management, but this challenge has not decreased in last two decades [1-6]. Alper et al. suggest that maintaining currency with relevant literature in primary care would "require 627.5 hours per month, or about 29 hours per weekday, or 3.6 full-time equivalents of physician effort" [7]. The volume of information associated with keeping up to date is frequently cited as a barrier [8]. It is estimated that annually there are approximately 10,000 new randomized trials in MEDLINE and over 450,000 clinical trials identified by the Cochrane Collaboration [9,10]. Keeping up to date has been described with several analogies including clinicians attempting to drink water from a fire hose and swimming in rivers of clinical research with unprecedented depth, velocity, and turbulence [11,12].
Difficulties with dissemination of research evidence and keeping up to date on pharmacotherapeutic interventions are reported despite the development of tools such as clinical practice guidelines and systematic reviews that are intended to reduce the need for practitioners to evaluate original research [13]. To complicate matters further, there are often issues of credibility, timeliness, and volume of clinical practice guidelines and reviews. Many guidelines are criticized for their methodological development. Shaneyfelt et al. reviewed 279 guidelines for methodological standards from peer reviewed medical literature [14]. These authors found that only 51%, 33.6%, and 46% adhered to standards on guideline development and format, evidence identification and summary, and formulation of recommendations, respectively [14]. A Canadian review on drug therapy guidelines found significant variation in quality depending on the developer [13]. Approximately 25% of guidelines were not recommended for use in practice by the appraisers' criteria [13]. As an example of the volume of clinical practice guidelines available, eleven recent guidelines on community acquired pneumonia exist [15]. To add to the complexities involved with keeping current with pharmacotherapeutic management strategies, as of 2000, there were over 22,000 drug products approved for sale in Canada for <span class="yellow">human</span> use [16].
There is also considerable debate regarding what constitutes "evidence" in practice, which contributes to confusion for clinicians [17,18]. Sim et al. succinctly describe the gap between evidence and action as difficulties with obtaining, systematically reviewing, applying in context, and measuring the outcome following application of evidence [19].<br><br>Maintaining competence – nurse practitioners as a new group of prescribers
Competencies for nurse practitioners (NPs) on a local and international level include critically appraising and applying literature and research findings in practice [20-23]. The Canadian Nurses Association (CNA) has developed the Canadian Nurse Practitioner Core Competency Framework that describes the knowledge, skills, judgment, and attributes required for practice. Evidence based practice is integral to pharmacotherapeutic interventions and prescribing competencies [23]. The National Prescribing Centre, an organization of the National Health Service in the UK, describes several competencies around information needs relevant to prescribing and emphasis is placed on using relevant and up to date information in various formats (e.g. print, electronic, verbal). Several related competencies include understanding advantages and disadvantages of information sources and the currency of resources [21]. Researchers in the US developed NP informatics competencies for integration into advanced nursing practice curricula [24]. Competencies related to informatics knowledge include critical analysis of data and information for use in evidence based practice, evaluating and applying relevant information, synthesizing best evidence, and using optimal search strategies to locate clinically sound and useful studies from information resources [24]. Achieving and maintaining competence in these domains as well as a solid foundation in pharmacology is necessary to support NPs in their relatively new role as a prescriber [25-27].<br><br>Knowledge management and information seeking behaviours among nurse practitioners and physicians
Information seeking behaviours of physicians are better documented than NPs [11]. Information related to diagnosis is important to both groups but drug therapy queries may occur more frequently with NPs [28-33]. Research on nurses' behaviours related to information seeking is available from the hospital setting [33-35] but the generalizability of these behaviours to NPs with a prescribing role is unclear. Differences in nursing roles, responsibilities, and legislation, including prescriptive authority, exist depending on the country of practice.<br><br>Nurse practitioners and their collaborating physician partners in Nova Scotia
Nova Scotia is a Canadian province with a population of approximately 942,000 [36]. The province is divided into six health zones that include nine district health authorities, one of which includes the provincial capital and is considered to be urban [37,38]. Health care service delivery is challenging due to many factors including the rural nature of the province, which is estimated to be 60% of population [37,39].
Starting in 1998, the Nova Scotia Department of Health led an initiative to explore different methods of delivering, managing, and funding primary care services. The Strengthening Primary Care in Nova Scotia Communities Initiative (SPCI) was established with the selection of four primary care demonstration sites where a primary health care NP was hired to practice collaboratively with one or more family/general physicians and other members of an interdisciplinary team. Each demonstration site adopted alternative (non fee-for-service) physician payment mechanisms and used electronic <span class="blue">patient</span> records (EPRs) to support service delivery [41]. Demonstration sites participated in project evaluation components that included, but were not limited to, NP roles, alternative fee structures, consumer satisfaction, and implementation and integration of EPRs [41,42].
Legislation to allow NPs to practice collaboratively with physicians in Nova Scotia was passed in 2002, part way through the SPCI project [39]. Prescriptive authority granted through legislation authorizes NPs to prescribe from a schedule of drugs [43,44]. At the time of conducting this research project, 16 primary health care NPs were in active practice [43].
The EPR component of the SPCI project evaluation provided information on the use of technologies in the community context. Results from the implementation process indicated that considerable attention is required for technology literacy, time for training, and selection of software for EPRs [41]. Although the majority of community-based, non-institutional clinical practice settings in Nova Scotia primarily operate with paper-based charting systems, there is a movement toward integrating electronic technologies, including the EPR, in practice among health care providers, administrators, and the provincial government. In addition to recording <span class="blue">patient</span> visit information, a component of the EPR package serves to provide drug information resources.
Drug therapy information resources for NPs and nurse prescribers have frequently been described as essential in supporting practice [25,28,29]. The role of NPs is relatively new in Canada [39] and there is limited information available to indicate the type of resources (e.g. print, electronic, EPR based) these prescribers use for drug and therapeutic information queries at the point of care. It is unknown as to whether differences exist regarding types of resources used, drug information needs, and utilization patterns among NPs and collaborating physician partners. Some research has suggested that the degree of multidisciplinary team functioning relates to the adoption of technology or innovations in practice but more research is required to determine the extent of these relationships [45,46].
The use of EPR technology is increasing in Nova Scotia but little information is available regarding the readiness of practitioners for use of specific features such as drug information resources. Based on the EPR related results of the SPCI evaluation, use of these functions could be challenging without proper facilitation. The purpose of the survey for this research was to describe drug information resources used by NPs and their collaborating physician partners at the point of care. The results of the survey will be used to guide further technology implementation strategies and stimulate further discussion around drug information resource usage at the point of care.<br><br>
Methods
Survey development
Survey development involved three stages including identification of important content areas, development of draft questions, and survey refinement.
Identifying important content areas for inclusion in the survey involved conducting a comprehensive English language literature search, consultation with relevant stakeholders (e.g. members of the Nova Scotia Department of Health), and input from subject matter experts at Dalhousie University. The literature review was conducted using the following bibliographic databases: PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA), and Web of Science Citation Databases. Hand and electronic searching of relevant journals was also conducted. Broad search terms were used without limits on publication date or place as nurse practitioner titles, roles and scopes of practice, and terminology regarding technology vary nationally and internationally. Some examples of terms used included nurse practitioner, nurse prescriber, nurse clinicians, district nurse, health visitor, drug information resources, drug information services, information needs, and information technology.
The draft survey was reviewed by the research team to reduce the number of items and improve clarity. The layout of the questionnaire was carefully examined to ensure that it was easy to follow and complete. Research results from a previous investigation of Nova Scotian physicians' behaviours regarding drug information were also used to further revise the survey [47]. This draft questionnaire was pilot tested by two out of province NPs and one physician. The results of the pilot were used to make final revisions to the survey. Based on pilot-testing feedback and investigator consensus, the final survey was divided into 2 versions, one for personal digital assistant (PDA) users and one for computer users.
The 10 page surveys for PDA and computer users had 5 or 6 sections, respectively, and 37 questions, many with multiple parts. The survey content included demographics, computer or PDA use and experience, drug and therapeutic resource use and preferences, PDA future use, perceived barriers and facilitators to PDA use, and technology training preferences.
Section one contained demographic questions such as gender, age, job title, volume of <span class="yellow">patients</span>, and EPR availability in the practice setting. Section two was designed to determine PDA or computer use and experience in the practice setting with questions regarding length of use, costs, and work versus home usage. This section also addressed usage and rating of different drug information resources. Resource ratings were based on the frequency of usage, usefulness, accessibility, credibility, and current/timeliness. Resources were grouped as print (i.e. books, journals, and clinical practice guidelines), online/electronic resources, and health professionals and other. Respondents used 5-point Likert scales (strongly agree to strongly disagree) for rating opinions related to resources. A rating of 6 (not applicable, I do not use this resource) was also included for respondents who did not use a particular resource. Frequency of searching for specific information was rated on a 3-point Likert scale (frequently to never). The final sections of the survey included categorical, open-ended, and Likert scale questions regarding preferred resources, technology barriers, PDA future use, and technology training preferences. Copies of the surveys are attached as an appendix in PDF format [see additional file 1 and 2] or can also be accessed from the Initiative for Medication Management, Policy Analysis, Research & Training (IMPART) website [48].
Ethics approval for the survey was granted through Dalhousie University Research Ethics Board on February 3, 2005.<br><br>Survey population
Licensed, actively practicing, primary health care NPs (n = 16) and their collaborating physician partners (n = 21) were eligible to participate.<br><br>Survey procedures
The survey recruitment procedures were based on the methods of Dillman [49] and Salant and Dillman [50]. Survey packages contained a cover letter, separate surveys for PDA and computer users, and a return self-addressed stamped envelope. The covering letter instructed respondents to self-select the appropriate survey (either PDA or computer) based on their drug information seeking behaviours. <span class="yellow">Participants</span> who had used a PDA at any time were instructed to complete the PDA version of the survey. Those who had never used a PDA for drug information were instructed to complete the computer version of the survey. Several strategies were used to optimize response rate and included: personalized cover letters, coloured paper for surveys, stamped return envelopes, follow-up mailing, and a priority post mailing [51]. The covering letter included coloured logos of Dalhousie University and the Nova Scotia Department of Health representing the investigator affiliations and endorsement of the project.
A master mailing list with names and addresses of NPs and their collaborating physician partners was created. To maintain confidentiality of respondents, a number placed on the bottom right corner of each survey corresponded to a name on the confidential master mailing sheet. The postage paid return envelopes were addressed to the research coordinator at the School of Nursing, Dalhousie University, who matched respondents to the mailing list from the first distribution. The cross-referenced mailing list was not accessible to those entering or analysing data. The research coordinator sent the second distribution to those who had not initially responded. A fluorescent coloured page was included in the second mailing to notify recipients of the second and final mailing status. The second mailing followed 2 weeks after the initial mailing (February 2005). The surveys were sent via Xpresspost™ through Canada Post.<br><br>Data analyses
Quantitative
Data were entered and analysed in Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) (version 11.5 for Windows). Five surveys were randomly selected as a check for accuracy of data entry. Descriptive statistics were used to describe resource usage by practitioners. Chi Square (Fisher's Exact when cell count less than 5) analyses were used to determine differences in computer or PDA use based on predetermined variables (e.g. high speed Internet connection, number of <span class="yellow">patients</span> per day). Mann Whitney U tests were used to compare physician and NPs Likert scale ratings (1 = strongly agree to 5 = strongly disagree) of resource use. Physician and NP rankings of all resources (print, online/electronic, and health professionals and other) were determined from means of Likert scale ratings (1 = strongly agree, 5 = strongly disagree) for each of the pre-specified characteristics (e.g. frequency of use, accessibility, etc.) and the frequency of use of the resources. The best rankings were assigned for the lowest mean scores and the largest number of the sample using a resource. These rankings (ranks based on mean and ranks based on sample) were then entered into a formula to calculate an overall rank. The formula includes: rank = [(rank according to % of sample using the resource + rank based on mean score) ÷ 2]. This formula was used to account for mean scores based on small samples as these numbers could potentially over or underestimate the value of a resource. Ratings of 6 (i.e. not applicable, I do not use this resource) were excluded from the analyses.<br><br>Qualitative
Comments were entered in a word-processing program and organized by type of respondent (PDA versus computer) and question number. The coded survey number and respondent type (NP or physician) were also included next to comments. Investigators determined themes and categorized comments based on previous experience, knowledge, and familiarity with the topic.<br><br><br><br>Results
Surveys were completed and returned by 75% of eligible <span class="yellow">participants</span> (27 of 36). One physician survey was undeliverable. The response rates from within the NP and physician samples were 88% and 65%, respectively. Complete demographic information is available in Table 1.
Methods for accessing resources and self-reported resource use
Resource use was similar amongst practitioners. Respondents indicated that print resources (mean 4.56, SD 0.80), health professionals (mean 3.26, SD 0.90), and online/electronic resources (mean 2.70, SD 1.20) were the preferred method (1 = least preferred to 5 = most preferred) for accessing drug information. Thirty-seven percent of respondents reported that searching for specific questions related to drug information (e.g. usual dosage, duration of therapy) was conducted using both print and electronic resources (but print use greater than electronic) (Table 2). The preferred means (i.e. print) to access resources was consistent with the most common means of conducting searches for specific drug information queries.
Respondents' ratings for pre-specified print, online/electronic, and professional resources and other, based on means from Likert scales and number of respondents using the resources, are presented in Tables 3, 4, and 5. Of all resources within the print, online/electronic, and health professionals or other categories, NPs and physicians rated the Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties (CPS) [52] and pharmacists as the top two most frequently used resources for providing drug and therapeutic information. Physicians rated other physicians as the third most frequently used resource. The book Therapeutic Choices [53] ranked third for NPs. Based on written feedback, physicians and NPs consulted pharmacists and other physicians most frequently. The CPS and pharmacists were also ranked as the top two resources overall in terms of usefulness, accessibility, credibility, and current/timeliness for physicians. Rankings by NPs were similar for usefulness, accessibility, and credibility. NPs ranked pharmacists, Therapeutic Choices, and academic detailing first and the CPS as second for current/timeliness.
Within the online/electronic category, electronic clinical practice guidelines (eCPGs) were rated the highest for all characteristics (e.g. usefulness, credibility). Although eCPGs were highly ranked, approximately 30% of the sample reported not using this resource. Other resources in this category were infrequently used based on respondents' self-reports.
Pharmaceutical industry representatives were used as a source of drug information by 85% and 86% of physicians and NPs, respectively (Table 5). This was higher than regional drug information services (used by 23% of physicians and 50% of NPs). After exclusion of traditional health professionals (i.e. physicians, nurses, pharmacists, allied health) in the health professionals and other category, pharmaceutical industry representatives received rankings for second or third for frequency of use, usefulness, accessibility, credibility, and current/timeliness, based on means and number of respondents using this resource (data not shown).<br><br>Differences between nurse practitioners and physicians
A series of Mann Whitney U tests were used to compare the responses of NPs and physicians on their use of print, online/electronic, and health professional resources. In total 95 statistical tests were conducted. The large number of tests increases the likelihood of a type I error as five significant differences would be expected by chance alone at an alpha threshold of 0.05. It is therefore important to treat these results with caution. A limited number of statistically significant (p < 0.05) differences were identified between physicians and NPs and are reported in Table 6. Therapeutic Choices differed significantly for frequency of use with more NPs making use of this resource. Allied health professionals significantly differed between NPs and physicians for accessibility and current/timeliness while NPs were more in agreement with these characteristics of the resource. Nurse colleague credibility and current/timeliness was rated significantly higher by NPs versus physicians.<br><br>Factors influencing electronic technology use at the point of care
Factors such as gender, age, practitioner type (NP vs physician), accessibility, technical support, Internet connection speed, <span class="blue">patient</span> volume, presence of an EPR, and home computer use were examined to determine if they were associated with the use of a work computer to search for drug information at the point of care. No statistically significant associations were found (Fisher's Exact).<br><br>Additional resources from respondent comments
Respondents indicated other resources and programs, such as clinical calculators, that they would like to access from their computer or PDA. The top three resources that were desired included Canadian clinical practice guidelines, <span class="blue">patient</span> education information, and ability to track clinical activities/statistics. Further comments from two NP computer survey respondents revealed that a resource on drug interactions and dosages would be desired. One other NP also indicated "up to date info [sic] on drugs to treat various illnesses ie doseage [sic], length of use etc."<br><br>Computer or personal digital assistant use in practice
Approximately 50% of computer survey respondents reported using their work computers for searching drug or therapeutic information related to <span class="blue">patient</span> care. Of those respondents, just over half (54%) also reported using their home computer for this purpose. Sixty-seven and 17% of PDA survey respondents reported using their PDA for searching drug or therapeutic information related to <span class="blue">patient</span> care at work and home, respectively.<br><br>Searching on a weekly basis for specific information related to drugs
Of the 24 specified categories of drug information included in the survey, the majority were reported as infrequently searched and a smaller percentage as never searched by respondents (data not shown). The top three categories rated as frequently searched were side effects, adult or usual drug dosage, and most appropriate drug for an indication. (Table 7)<br><br>Issues related to personal digital assistants
Respondents reported their level of agreement with statements related to how PDAs may influence their practice. The statements included aspects of workload (organization and paper work), convenience, and improving quality of care and <span class="blue">patient</span> outcomes. (Table 8) Respondents agreed that PDAs are a convenient resource but indicated that PDAs would not decrease paperwork or improve <span class="blue">patient</span> health outcomes.<br><br>Barriers and facilitators to personal digital assistants: themes from written comments
Peer support from colleagues, convenience, standardized usage, and financial and technical support were the main perceived facilitators to PDA use reported by respondents. The main perceived barrier to PDA use reported by respondents (n = 10) included cost. Other factors such as technology literacy, time, lack of peer support, no high speed internet for downloads, lack of needed resources, keeping up to date on resources, and searching speed were also reported.<br><br>Future use of personal digital assistants
Fifty-two percent, including current PDA users, reported that they would use a PDA in the future. Twenty two percent were  uncertain and 19% reported that they would not use a PDA in the future. Two <span class="yellow">people</span> did not respond.<br><br>Confidentiality
Fifty two percent of respondents indicated that <span class="blue">patient</span> confidentiality with PDAs was no more concerning compared to use of other technologies. Forty-four percent did not know if they had a policy on <span class="blue">patient</span> confidentiality with regard to technologies.<br><br>Technology training and reimbursement
Respondents rated (1 = least preferred to 5 = most preferred) one on one instruction and group learning led by an expert facilitator as the most preferred (mean 4.32, SD 0.99) means by which to receive instruction on a new technology. Least preferred methods included online discussions/chatrooms (mean 1.52, SD 1.04), internet videos (live: mean 1.70, SD 1.10, or static: mean 1.87, SD 1.14), video cassettes (mean 2.30, SD 1.55), trial and error learning (mean 2.32, SD 1.28), and written manuals (mean 2.92, SD 1.44). Paid leave for attendance at technology training sessions was the preferred means (mean 1.77, SD 0.86; 1 = strongly agree to 5 = strongly disagree) of remuneration for respondents. Respondents also indicated that if financial remuneration was to occur, it should correspond to the amount of time for training that is required (versus a flat rate) (mean 1.96, SD 1.08). Continuing education credits were not viewed as an incentive (mean 2.69, SD 1.44).<br><br>
Discussion
Preferred resources
In our study, printed materials (e.g. compendia, journals, textbook resources) and professionals (e.g. pharmacists) were the most preferred and frequently used means to access information. Physician reliance on text and compendia relative to online/electronic resources has been frequently reported [11]. In a study examining family doctors' use of information sources to answer clinical questions, <span class="yellow">human</span> resources (e.g. doctor, pharmacist), non-prescribing print information (e.g. textbooks and journal articles), and prescribing texts were used 36%, 32%, and 25% of the time, respectively [54]. Books from the workplace were reported by approximately 79% of UK primary care nurses as a commonly used source of knowledge and information used to support practice [55]. Fewer than one-third (31%) reported using electronic resources (e.g. Internet, electronic journals) for this purpose [55]. Results of a postal questionnaire to NPs demonstrated that 61% and 51% of respondents reported using drug reference manuals and textbooks, respectively, a few times a week or more [29]. These frequencies were second and third only to consulting with their physician supervisor (63%). Data from structured interviews of a sample of 22 community nurse prescribers reported by Hall et al. revealed that the majority relied on print materials to access information, namely the British National Formulary [32]. A survey of a primary care practice-based research network in the US that included physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners, revealed that interpersonal and rapidly accessed print resources were preferred. Sixty-one and 58% of respondents reported using drug reference sources such as the Physician's Desk Reference (PDR) and medical textbooks, respectively, a few times a day or daily [56].
The clinicians in our sample perceived the Canadian compendium, the CPS, to be useful, accessible, credible, and current/timely. The CPS, is described as "the Canadian drug reference for health professionals" and is intended to provide a central source of drug information on drug products available in Canada [52]. It is available in print (English and French) and became available online in June 2004. The CPS includes drug monographs for commonly used products approved for use in Canada, but it does not include all drugs available on the Canadian market [57]. The majority of these product monographs are based on monographs submitted by pharmaceutical manufacturers and approved by Health Canada. Some of the monographs are written by the Canadian Pharmacists Association and are described as being evidence-based [52]. The CPS also includes more than 100 pages of clinical tools [52]. The CPS has been criticized for including pharmaceutical company advertising and requiring manufacturer payment for inclusion of product monographs [58]. The accuracy of particular components of CPS monographs has also been investigated. A review of overdose management in 119 monographs from the 2001 CPS revealed considerable variability in the utility of information with 50% of the monographs containing misleading or dangerous advice [59]. Since 2004, the CPS has included an alert box in the overdose section of monographs notifying users to contact Poison Control Centres for overdose management information. Some authors have criticized references that are similar to the CPS as being inadequate with regard to inclusion of evidence based information [60].
The NPs in our sample also rated Therapeutic Choices highly for all characteristics.  This finding is most likely  attributable to the fact that it is a recommended resource for coursework  associated with the Dalhousie NP university program curriculum.  Therapeutic Choices is a concise therapeutics reference text published by the Canadian Pharmacists Association. The text contains approximately 120 extensively referenced chapters with a disease management approach including easy to use algorithms and tables. An editorial board is responsible for extensively reviewing the content to ensure unbiased and objective information is presented [53].<br><br>Health professionals
Reliance on other health professionals, especially pharmacists and physicians, as a resource for information was evident from our study and concurs with the findings of others [28,32,55,61]. Nurse practitioners have reported that collaborative relationships with pharmacists increase NP role satisfaction [61]. NPs frequently consult with allied health care professionals in their primary health care provider role and this is supported by written feedback from our sample regarding frequently consulted health professionals. Nursing colleagues are also likely to be rated highly by NPs due to their affiliation with peers from the same profession.
Some investigators have shown that non-<span class="yellow">human</span> references (e.g. textbook) are sought for more technical aspects of prescribing (e.g. dose), whereas guidance regarding selection of agents (i.e. right drug for an indication) is sought from <span class="yellow">human</span> resources (e.g. pharmacists or physicians) [62]. We were unable to determine what kinds of resources were used for specific purposes from our study.<br><br>Online and electronic resources, computers, and personal digital assistants
From our study, computer survey respondents ranked online/electronic resources third in preference following print and health professionals. Various barriers and facilitators to accessing information online/electronically or via the Internet have been described in the literature [55,63-66]. Variables that have been described by others as barriers such as accessibility, high speed internet access, <span class="blue">patient</span> volume, age, practitioner type, and technology support did not appear to influence computer searching for information on drugs or therapeutics related to <span class="blue">patient</span> care in our results. Some qualitative feedback does however support this notion. As an example, in response to a request for a rationale for not using computers one physician commented: "Retro tech [sic]/old fashion. I still like to use my mind and have always been a fan of pen and paper". Barriers that were identified with our sample regarding the use of handheld technologies such as PDAs included cost, time, and issues related to technology literacy. Several <span class="yellow">people</span> questioned the value of PDAs. One GP stated when referring to a PDA: "So far I have not discovered a use for one". Other respondents reinforced their preferences for other resources (e.g. books) and resistance to technology. When responding to barriers for the use of PDAs, one NP commented, "My huge dislike for machinery that frequently requires updating and patience". A physician responded, "as stated, I like to use my own mind, and can get all the info I need from books relatively quickly". Facilitators to the use of PDAs mainly included convenience factors such as having resources all in one place, faster means to get information, and portability. Our sample was not in agreement with some convenience factors in that they did not feel that PDAs would decrease paperwork. Practitioners from our sample felt relatively neutral about PDAs improving <span class="blue">patient</span>'s health outcomes with 41% responding in this manner. Results from a sample of primary care practitioners in the US revealed that 76% agreed that the use of handheld devices for electronic prescribing would substantially reduce medical errors and improve the quality of health care [67].
Our study also suggests that resources such as the Cochrane Library and its Database of Systematic Reviews were not frequently used. This finding is similar to that of other investigators [30,35,64]. Despite the desire of some clinicians to use these resources, lack of confidence and ability to use them appropriately has been found [30,64,68,69]. Our study suggests that although this resource is perceived as credible, current/timely, and useful, it is also perceived to be somewhat inaccessible. The Cochrane Library is available to the health professionals (e.g. nurses, physicians, pharmacists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, etc.) in our sample through professional bodies via the Atlantic Health Knowledge Partnership [70].<br><br>Technology training: preferences and incentives
With regard to receiving training for a new technology, our study demonstrates that in <span class="yellow">person</span> conferences or one on one training sessions are the preferred means to receive continuing education. <span class="yellow">Person</span> to <span class="yellow">person</span> interaction has been reported as the preferred and most frequently used means to access continuing education or training by other investigators [55,71].
Our study also indicates that this group of practitioners may benefit from accessing resources [72-80] that provide guidance on useful drug information resources available for devices such as PDAs. This is exemplified by one respondent's statement "knowledge regarding good software programs" as a barrier to the use of PDAs.<br><br>Pharmaceutical industry
The influence of the pharmaceutical industry on physician prescribing and research outcomes has been documented [81,82]. Although NP use of industry representatives as a source of pharmacological information has been documented, the influence on prescribing is largely uninvestigated [32,61,83-85]. The CNA competency framework includes a statement regarding prescribing and industry relations [23]. In our study, the physician and NP rankings of industry representatives were similar. Within the health professionals and other category, pharmaceutical representatives were used as a resource by more of the sample than regional drug information services and comparably to academic detailing services. Academic detailing is a form of continuing  medical education where a trained health professional visits prescribers for  a fifteen to twenty minute session to provide objective information  regarding a therapeutic topic based on best available evidence [86,87]. Following academic detailing, physician and NP rankings of pharmaceutical industry representatives were second or third for frequency of use, usefulness, accessibility, credibility, and current/timeliness.<br><br>Limitations
We do not have demographics or information regarding the reasons why survey recipients did not respond. As per ethical requirements to maintain confidentiality of respondents, we were not able to match respondents from their respective place of practice and therefore cannot conclude whether the practitioners within a practice setting influenced the others' responses. The sample size of the survey is small although it includes 88% response from community based NPs in Nova Scotia. The generalizability of the results is limited due to the variations in NP scopes of practice nationally and internationally. It is unknown whether the findings are generalizable to nonresponding physicians within Nova Scotia collaborating with NPs or to physicians not in collaborative practices with NPs as they were not included as a part of the sample. Due to multiple statistical comparisons (Mann Whitney U), the results comparing NP and physician ratings of results should be interpreted with caution.<br><br>
Conclusion
Respondent ratings of resources and preferences for resource use were consistent with self-reported means of conducting searches for specific drug information queries. The use of computers and PDAs remains limited and also matches preferences and resource ratings. Education to this group of practitioners regarding available drug information resources may facilitate use of computer and PDA resources. Further research is needed to determine methods to increase the use of computers and PDAs and if use of these technologies affects prescribing and <span class="blue">patient</span> outcomes.<br><br>Competing interests

<h3>pmcA1636465</h3>Expression of C-terminal deleted p53 isoforms in neuroblastoma
Abstract
The tumor suppressor gene, p53, is rarely mutated in neuroblastomas (NB) at the time of diagnosis, but its dysfunction could result from a nonfunctional conformation or cytoplasmic sequestration of the wild-type p53 protein. However, p53 mutation, when it occurs, is found in NB tumors with drug resistance acquired over the course of chemotherapy. As yet, no study has been devoted to the function of the specific p53 mutants identified in NB cells. This study includes characterization and functional analysis of p53 expressed in eight cell lines: three wild-type cell lines and five cell lines harboring mutations. We identified two transcription-inactive p53 variants truncated in the C-terminus, one of which corresponded to the p53β isoform recently identified in normal tissue by Bourdon et al. [J. C. Bourdon, K. Fernandes, F. Murray-Zmijewski, G. Liu, A. Diot, D. P. Xirodimas, M. K. Saville and D. P. Lane (2005) Genes Dev., 19, 2122–2137]. Our results show, for the first time, that the p53β isoform is the only p53 species to be endogenously expressed in the <span class="yellow">human</span> NB cell line SK-N-AS, suggesting that the C-terminus truncated p53 isoforms may play an important role in NB tumor development.<br><br>INTRODUCTION
The p53 tumor suppressor gene remains the most frequently altered gene in <span class="yellow">human</span> tumors. Several p53 mutation databases have been reported previously (1–3), and to date, more than 1500 different p53 mutants have been described (4). Functional inactivation of p53 is usually due to gene mutation, deletion or protein degradation. In general, the majority of p53 mutations in <span class="yellow">human</span> neoplasia are missense mutations affecting the DNA-binding domain (DBD). Unlike other <span class="yellow">human</span> cancers, p53 in neuroblastoma (NB) is rarely mutated in the primary tumor at diagnosis but high levels of wild-type p53 (wt p53) protein expression have been found in the cytoplasm of undifferentiated tumors (5,6). More recently, in normal unstressed cells, wt p53 protein was found to be retained in the cytoplasm as a latent form, in huge, p53-associated protein complexes known as ‘Parc’ (7). The steady-state concentration of p53 in normal unstressed cells is usually very low because of the short half-life of the wild-type (wt) protein. Overexpression of p53 in most of the transformed cells containing a missense mutation within the p53 gene appears to be due to the increased stability of mutated p53 (8). In unstressed NB cells, high wt p53 expression may reflect the embryonic origin of NBs, in which precursor cells fail to mature (9).
p53 mutations are unusual in <span class="yellow">human</span> NB but, when they do occur, are found in post-chemotherapy tumors. In this respect, Tweddle et al. (10) described how two NB cell lines derived from the same <span class="blue">patient</span> can elicit a different p53 status: wt p53 for SK-N-BE(1a) established before treatment, and mutated p53 for SK-N-BE(2c) established after relapse of the <span class="blue">patient</span> under treatment with cytotoxic agents such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and radiotherapy. In NB cell lines, p53 mutation has been found in multidrug-resistant cells (11). Various types of p53 mutation have been detected in NB cells and can lead to inactivation either by shut-down of protein expression or production of aberrant p53 products. Indeed, in LAN-1 cells, p53 nonsense mutation at cysteine 182 in exon 5 leads to the absence of protein (9), whereas in SK-N-BE(2) cells, missense mutation at codon 135 (C135F) leads to stable overexpressed protein (11). By analyzing IGR-N-91, a cell line established in our laboratory from the bone marrow of a <span class="blue">patient</span> with metastatic NB after unsuccessful Adriamycin–vincristine chemotherapy (12), we identified another type of aberrant protein that arises from the duplication of exons 7-8-9. This duplication spans from amino acids 225 to 331, which represent part of the DBD and part of the oligomerization domain (13). However, each p53 mutant has been described in the literature as a case report, and so far, no comparative study has been undertaken to link their biochemical features with functional properties.
In the present study we report two novel p53 C-terminus mutants identified in SK-N-AS and IGR-NB8 <span class="yellow">human</span> NB cell lines. The biological properties of these two new variants were analyzed in comparison with p53 isolated from six other <span class="yellow">human</span> NB lines: three [LAN-1, SK-N-BE(2) and IGR-N-91] expressing mutant p53 and three (SH-SY5Y, LAN-5 and IMR-32) expressing the wt protein. This characterization was done by using a range of functional assays: (i) the ability of the protein to bind with p53 consensus sequence using the functional analysis of separated allele in <span class="yellow">yeast</span> (FASAY); (ii) the ability of the protein to transactivate the p53-responsive element (RE) identified either in the promoter of p21/WAF1 or in the first intron of BAX, using luciferase reporter assay; (iii) the induction of endogenous p21/WAF1 gene expression under stress conditions.<br><br>MATERIALS AND METHODS
Neuroblastoma cell lines, culture and drug treatments
The parental <span class="yellow">human</span> NB SH-SY5Y, SK-N-AS, IMR-32 and SK-N-BE(2) cell lines were purchased from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC, Wiltshire, UK). The <span class="yellow">human</span> IGR-NB8 cells (a gift of Prof. Gilles Vassal, UPRES EA 3535, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif) were derived from a previously untreated localized NB (14). The LAN-1 and LAN-5 cell lines were provided by Dr Nicole Gross (Pediatric Oncology Research, Lausanne, Switzerland). The <span class="yellow">human</span> IGR-N-91 cell line was established in our laboratory from the bone marrow of a <span class="blue">patient</span> with metastatic NB after unsuccessful adriamycin–vincristin chemotherapy (12). LAN-1, LAN-5 and IMR-32 were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 2 mM l-glutamine and 10% fetal <span class="yellow">calf</span> serum and gentamicine 10 μg/ml. Others cell lines were cultured in DMEM.
For activation of endogenous p53, cells were treated with cis-platinum (Sigma) (10 μg/ml) for 24 h then lysed for western blot analysis.<br><br>Western blot analysis
This procedure was carried out as described previously (13). Protein lysates (50 μg) were submitted to 10% SDS–PAGE, and then transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. After saturation, the membranes were incubated with primary antibody diluted in 0.1% phosphate-buffered saline, Tween-20 and 3% skim milk. The primary antibodies used were anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (clone DO-7, 1/1000, DAKO), anti-p21/WAF1 monoclonal antibody (Ab-1, 1/200, Oncogene Research) and anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (1/1000; Chemicon) as internal control. Protein bands were detected by ECL system (Amersham).<br><br>PCR, plasmids cloning
Genomic DNA was extracted using lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5; 0.4 M NaCl; 0.5% SDS; 10 mM EDTA, treated with proteinase K (200 μg/μl), purified with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in DNase free water. Total RNA were purified using RNAble reagent (Eurobio), precipitated with isopropanol and dissolved in RNase free water. cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription of 1 μg of total RNA using Superscript II™ RNase H-Reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and Oligo-d(T)16 in conditions specified by the manufacturer. Amplification of full-length p53 coding region from SH-SY5Y, IGR-N-91, IGR-NB8 and SK-N-BE(2) cell lines was performed using forward primer at position 152 and reverse primer at position 1583 (F1 and R7, respectively, Table 1; GenBank accession no. K03199). p53 cDNA from SK-N-AS cells for cloning was obtained from RT–PCR using F1 and reverse primer i9+: 5′-GCAAAGTCATAGAACCATTTTCAT-3′ (nucleotide position 14989, GenBank accession no. X54156) primers which encompass from exon 1 to exon i9+ first identified by Flaman et al. (15) included. The PCR was done in the presence of pfu Hotstart DNA polymerase (Stratagene) for 30 cycles of 1 min at 90°C, 1 min at 65°C and 2 min 30 s at 72°C using PTC-100 thermocycler (MJ-Research).
The p53 cDNA from SH-SY5Y, SK-N-AS, IGR-N-91, IGR-NB8 and SK-N-AS cells were then cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His-Topo vector (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The p53 sequence of each cell line was investigated by sequencing of plasmids after cloning. Sequencing was performed by Genome Express (Meylan, France).
The pDDm-TO harboring p53 dominant negative form (p53DD) pGL3-E1bTATA and the pE1B-hWAF1 firefly luciferase reporter containing the p53-responsive element of the p21/WAF1 promoter were described previously (16,17) pE1B-BAXi contains the p53RE identified in the intron 1 of the BAX gene [(18) and D. Munsch, personal communication]. Oligonucleotides TCGAGGGCAGGCCCGGGCTTGTCG and CTAGCGACAAGCCCGGGCCTGCCC were annealed and cloned into pGL3-E1bTATA digested with NheI and XhoI to obtain pE1B-BAXi. The pcDNA3-ΔNp73α expression plasmid was a gift of Dr Daniel Caput (SANOFI, Labèges, France).<br><br>Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)
Cytogenetic preparations
Metaphase spreads from healthy <span class="yellow">human</span> male lymphocytes and tumor cell lines were prepared as described previously (19). BAC probe RP11-199F11, containing a 167 kb region spanning TP53 gene, was labeled by random priming in the presence of Alexa 594-dUTP (Molecular Probes). A commercial probe specific for chromosome 17 centromere, and labeled with spectrum green, was obtained from Vysis. After over-night cohybridization of the probes in the presence of Cot-1 DNA, the slides were washed and DNA counterstained with DAPI. The preparations were observed with an epifluorescence microscope and images captured with a Vysis imaging station. Between 3 and 14 metaphases spreads and 30–200 nuclei were examined for each cell line.<br><br>
Luciferase reporter assays
LAN-1 or SH-SY5Y cells were seeded in duplicates onto 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells per cm2 and cotransfected 24 h later with 0.5 μg (2.5 μg/ml) of pGL3 firefly luciferase reporter gene plasmid under the control of either pE1B-hWAF1 or pE1B-BAX using lipofectamine 2000 and 1 μg of either a p53 expressing plasmid or an empty vector. At 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed with 200 μl/well of passive lysis buffer provided with the ‘Luciferase assay kit’ (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using Microlumat LB96P luminometer (EG & G Berthold Instrument).<br><br>Functional assay in <span class="yellow">yeast</span>
cDNA was obtained by RT of 1 μg of total RNA using Superscript II™ RNase H-Reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamers to prime the synthesis in conditions specified by the manufacturer. p53 cDNA was amplified by PCR and cotransformed into <span class="yellow">yeast</span>, IG397 Ade2 strain, together with either pRDI-22 vector for p53-standard assay or pFW35 and pFW34 plasmid for 5′ or 3′ split assay, respectively, carrying the ADE2 open reading frame under the control of a p53-responsive promoter (20). In a selective medium lacking leucine, wt-p53 activates transcription of ADE2 gene that encodes enzyme—phosphoribosylimidazole carboxylase—implicated in adenine biosynthesis. Therefore, a colony of cells that expresses ADE2 gene is white whereas the one composed of cells where ADE2 gene is not expressed owing p53 mutation is red.<br><br>
RESULTS
P53 status in SK-N-AS and IGR-NB8 cells
We first compared the migration profiles of p53 expressed in SK-N-AS and IGR-NB8 with those expressed in the other six NB cells, SH-SY5Y, LAN-5, LAN-1, IMR-32, SK-N-BE(2) and IGR-N-91. Western blots from 50 μg of total protein extracts were revealed with p53 monoclonal antibody (DO-7). A range of profiles was identified as shown in Figure 1A. As expected, p53 extracted from the three cell lines, SH-SY5Y, LAN-5 and IMR-32, expressing wt protein (13,21) migrated at the wt position. Of particular note in these three wt p53 cell lines was an additional faint band that migrated faster than the full-length protein. The LAN-1 cells were found to be p53 deficient (9). The SK-N-BE(2) cell line showed an intense band reflecting p53 stability due to a missense mutation at codon 135 (11). As expected, due to the previously identified duplication of exons 7-8-9 (13), p53 protein migration was delayed in the IGR-N-91 cells. In contrast, the p53 protein in the SK-N-AS cell line migrated noticeably faster than the wt protein, indicating that it was smaller in size. The p53 protein in the IGR-NB8 cell line was even smaller than that in SK-N-AS.
To analyze the coding region of each of the p53 variants, RT–PCR was performed using p53-specific F1-R7 primers (Table 1 and Figure 1B). The expected 1430 bp for full-length p53 was amplified from wt p53-expressing SH-SY5Y, LAN-5 and IMR-32 cell lines. As SK-N-BE(2) harbors a single point mutation at codon 135 (C135F), the amplified fragment analyzed by electrophoresis migrated as wt p53 (Figure 1B). The longer RT–PCR fragment from the mutated IGR-N-91 cell line resulted from the duplication of exons 7-8-9, as shown in our previous data (13), which corresponds to extra nucleic material of 321 nt. For the LAN-1 cells, no amplified fragment was observed in accordance with published data, which demonstrates the extremely low levels of p53 mRNA and the undetectable level of protein (9). An amplified fragment of the same length as the wt protein was observed in the IGR-NB8 cell line (Figure 1B). Indeed, complete gene sequencing revealed a point mutation E326STOP leading to a truncated protein at C-terminus. No fragment, however, was amplified from SK-N-AS with F1-R7 primers.
To further map the p53 mRNA transcribed in these cells, series of RT–PCR tests were performed using the forward primer, F2 (exon 8 position 1008th according to GenBank accession no. K03199), matched with different reverse primers, R3 (at the junction of exon 8/9, nt position 1124), R4, R5 (in exon 9 at positions 1154 and 1184, respectively), and R6 (in exon 10, at position 1230). The sequences of these primers are given in Table 1 and the results are presented in Figure 2A. SK-N-AS cDNA gave an amplified fragment of the same size as SH-SY5Y cDNA with the three primer pairs, F2/R3, F2/R4 and F3/R5. However, in contrast to SH-SY5Y, no fragment was obtained with SK-N-AS cDNA using the F2/R6 primer pair, which suggests the absence of exon 10 in SK-N-AS mRNA.<br><br>The p53 protein expressed in SK-N-AS is the p53β isoform
An alternatively spliced form of <span class="yellow">human</span> p53 mRNA with an additional 133 bp exon derived from intron 9 has been detected in normal <span class="yellow">human</span> lymphocytes (15). This spliced variant named ‘i9+’ encodes a truncated protein of 341 amino acids including 10 new amino acids derived from the novel exon, the p53β isoform according to Bourdon et al. nomenclature (22). This led us to hypothesize that the shorter protein expressed by the SK-N-AS cell line could be the p53β isoform. To test this hypothesis, RT–PCRs were performed using primer sets designed to amplify the 3′ region of p53 mRNA encoding either the specific C-terminal part of the wt protein (wt C-ter) or the specific C-terminal part of the β isoform (β C-ter). In parallel amplification with a primer pair amplifying the DBD was used as control. The sequences of these oligonucleotides are given in Table 1. The results presented in Figure 2B are consistent with the only expression of the p53β isoform in SK-N-AS as no band was observed in lane using specific C-ter primer located in exon 10. Interestingly, RT–PCR using SH-SY5Y (SH) gave an amplified fragment not only with the primer pair specific to the C-ter domain of wt p53 but also with the primer pair specific to the p53β isoform. This result, combined with the presence of an additional faint band migrating faster than wt p53 in denaturing polyacrylamide gel (Figure 1A), strongly suggests that both the p53 full-length protein and the β isoform were expressed in the SH-SY5Y cells.
The full-length SK-N-AS p53 cDNA was then amplified with the forward primer F1 and a reverse primer located within the novel exon i9+ (Table 1). This amplified fragment was cloned in pcDNA3/V5-His-Topo, as described in Materials and Methods. Its sequence analysis confirmed that the truncated p53 expressed in SK-N-AS was encoded by the i9+ splice variant described previously by Flaman et al. (15) that encodes the p53β isoform characterized by Bourdon et al. (22).
A series of genomic amplifications were performed to identify a possible deletion within the intron 9 that could account for the absence of normal size p53 in SK-N-AS cells. The primer sequences are given in Table 1. Amplifications were performed in parallel with total DNA extracted from SH-SY5Y and SK-N-AS cells. Results are presented in Figure 3. Normal size fragments that encompass the acceptor site of intron 9 were amplified with SH-SY5Y as well as with SK-N-AS DNA. On the contrary amplification fragments that encompass the intron 9 donor site were obtained only with SH-SY5Y but not with SK-N-AS DNA. These results identify a deletion of the intron 9/exon 10 junction within the SK-N-AS p53 gene.<br><br>A <span class="yellow">yeast</span> functional assay confirmed the absence of p53 full-length expression in SK-N-AS and IGR-NB8
It is possible to detect p53 mutation using a simple <span class="yellow">yeast</span> colony color assay as described by Flaman et al. (23). When the strain is transformed with a plasmid-encoding wt p53, the cells express the ADE2 gene and produce white colonies (Figure 4A, a, b2 and c1, and Figure 4B, dish a). Cells containing mutant p53 fail to express ADE2 and form small red colonies (Figure 4A, b and b1, and Figure 4B, dish c). When the p53 cDNA fragment is deleted, cells are unable to form a colony (Figure 4A, c and c2). As shown in Table 2, FASAY was performed as a p53-standard test with full-length cDNA or with the split version at the 5′ and 3′ end (15). The background of FASAY experiments is around 10%. p53 wt expressing SH-SY5Y and LAN-5, 2 wt cell lines, yielded ∼92–97% of white colonies (Table 2).
One hundred percent of the colonies carrying SK-N-BE(2) p53, which is homozygous for the C135F mutation, turned red with the standard or 5′ split assay, whereas 94% of the colonies turned white with the 3′ split assay since the missense mutation does not extend to the C′-terminus of the gene (Table 2 and Figure 4B, dish c). No colonies were observed with p53-deficient LAN-1 cells, (see also Figure 4A, c and c2). With SK-N-AS cells, the split 5′ assay gave 96% white colonies, while the p53-standard and split 3′ assay did not produce any colonies (Table 2). This means that the 5′ terminus was intact whereas the 3′ terminus had been deleted, as was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. The IGR-NB8 colonies, however, were red both with the p53-standard assay and the split 3′ assay. In the IGR-N-91 cell line, where p53 harbors two contiguous sets of exons 7–9, spanning the DBD and oligomerization domain, it is interesting to note that the <span class="yellow">yeast</span> colonies were predominantly white (Figure 4B, dish b) with the split 5′ and the split 3′ assay (96 and 87% of white colonies, respectively) This suggests that the cells express a binding ability that is specific to wild-type p53 rather than mutated p53 (Table 2).<br><br>Transcription activity of SH-SY5Y, IGR-N-91, SK-N-BE(2), SK-N-AS and IGR-NB8 p53 variants in mammalian cells
To determine the transactivation ability of p53 variants in mammalian cells, we used a reporter gene strategy. The p53RE located within either the <span class="yellow">human</span> p21/WAF1 promoter or the intron 1 of the <span class="yellow">mouse</span> and <span class="yellow">human</span> BAX gene [(18) and D. Munsch, personnal communication) were cloned in a luciferase reporter gene plasmid upstream of the E1B minimal promoter as described in Materials and Methods. The p53-negative LAN-1 cells were cotransfected with the p53 vectors expressing the p53 cloned from either SH-SY5Y, IGR-N-91, SK-N-BE(2), SK-N-AS or IGR-NB8 and the luciferase reporter plasmids. Both p53RE were strongly stimulated in cells cotransfected with wt p53 cloned from SH-SY5Y, as compared to cells cotransfected with an empty plasmid. In contrast, none of the p53 variants was able to transactivate the expression of luciferase driven by either p21/WAF1 or BAX p53RE (Figure 5).
To test transactivation capability at the protein level, each variant was transfected into p53-negative LAN-1 cells and the stimulation of endogenous p21/Waf1 gene expression was analyzed by western blotting. As shown in Figure 6, in contrast to wt p53, none of the p53 variants was able to induce p21 protein accumulation.
We then tested for a possible dominant negative effect of these various mutants on wt p53-dependent transcriptional activity. To this end, SH-SY5Y cells were cotransfected with constructs encoding the luciferase gene driven by either the p21/Waf1 or BAX p53RE and the constructs expressing the various p53s cloned from IGR-NB8, SK-N-BE(2), IGR-N-91, SK-N-AS and IGR-NB8 NB cells or p53DD, a dominant negative mutant of wt p53 (24). The stress induced by transfection activated the transcriptional activity of the wt p53 expressed in SH-SY5Y, leading to a p53-dependent expression of luciferase as illustrated by the fact that coexpression of p53DD led to a substantial decrease in luciferase activity when compared to the luciferase activity of cells cotransfected with an empty plasmid (Figure 5). Compared to p53DD, mutants within the DBD isolated from IGR-N-91 or SK-N-BE(2) had only a moderate dominant negative effect on endogenous wt p53 transcriptional activity. More surprisingly, the transfection of the C-terminal truncated variant IGR-NB8 enhanced both BAX and p21/WAF1 p53RE activity. The coexpression of p53β cloned from SK-N-AS also enhanced BAX p53RE activity. A similar effect has been reported already for p53β by Bourdon et al. (22).
When combined, these results show that all the p53 variants isolated from the NB cells had lost the ability to specifically transactivate the p53 target genes. Their effect on the transcriptional activity of endogenous wt p53 expressed in SH-SY5Y cells, however, largely depended on the p53 domain affected by the modification.<br><br>All the identified p53 variants inhibited the induction of endogenous p21/WAF1 gene expression under stress conditions
We further examined whether the four p53 variants, SK-N-BE(2), IGR-N-91, SK-N-AS and IGR-NB8, had loss their ability to stimulate the endogenous expression of the p21/WAF1 gene, the archetypical cell cycle inhibitor and the true target of p53. To this end, cellular response to genotoxic stress was analyzed by western blot following treatment of the various cell lines with cisplatin, one of the most potent antitumor agents used in neuroblastoma. Results are presented in Figure 7. None of the mutant cells, regardless of the type of mutation, was able to induce p21/WAF1 protein accumulation, unlike the 3 p53 wild-type cells (SH-SY5Y, IMR-32 and LAN-5).<br><br>Genomic status of TP53 region in the various cell lines
According to Knudson's ‘two hit’ model of tumor suppressor gene functional inactivation, the mutation of one allele is supposed to be associated with a deletion of the second allele. To assess this genetic mechanism, we performed FISH experiments to search for deletions of one copy of the TP53 region, especially in cell lines with a mutated TP53 gene. For this purpose, metaphase preparations of the studied cell lines were cohybridized with a p53 DNA probe labeled in red (BAC clone RP11-199F11) as described previously (25) and a chromosome 17-specific centromeric probe labeled in green. The three cell lines shown previously to express a wt p53 protein (LAN5, IMR32 and SH-SY5Y), displayed as expected two signals with each probe, confirming the presence of both TP53 alleles in these cells (Figure 8 and Table 3). Conversely, IGR-N-91 and SK-N-AS cell lines displayed only one fluorescent signal for each probe, suggesting a whole chromosome 17 lost, or at least losses of the 17p arm and the centromeric region. The SK-N-BE(2) cell line has been described as containing only one chromosome 17 and one TP53 signal (10). In our analysis, only 10% of the cells displayed this characteristic, whilst most of the cells had two copies of both (Figure 8 and Table 3). p53 sequencing, however, confirmed the previously described mutation, and the absence of a normal allele, suggesting that the cells used in our study had acquired, during culture, an uniparental disomy for the TP53-mutated chromosome 17. Finally, the other two cell lines (LAN-1 and IGR-NB8) displayed highly variable genetic heterogeneity from one cell to the next (Table 3). Surprisingly, although p53 transcripts are extremely faintly expressed in LAN-1 cell line, all cells showed several FISH signals with the 167 kb BAC probe used here. To understand this apparent contradiction, an array-CGH experiment was performed on an oligo-array Agilent, which indicated a 133 kb interstitial deletion corresponding to the p53 coding region and the 97 kb upstream region. Accordingly, the fluorescent spots observed in FISH experiments on LAN-1 cells should be related to the hybridization of the 57 kb region downstream of p53 gene present in the BAC probe. IGRN-B8 cell line displayed a number of signals of both colors ranging from 0 to 4, with 87% of cells displaying a loss for one TP53 allele. Despite this genomic variability, analysis of the p53 protein showed a single shortened form in IGR-N-B8 cell line (Figure 1). Consequently, and as suggested for SK-N-BE(2) cell line, IGR-N-B8 cell line should contain a variable number of copies of chromosome 17 with mutated p53.<br><br>
DISCUSSION
The p53 gene, the ‘genome guardian’, is mutated in over 50% of <span class="yellow">human</span> cancers, with the most common mutations being missense mutations (>2/3 of mutations) (26). In <span class="yellow">human</span> neuroblastoma tumors, p53 mutations are rarely present at the time of diagnosis (5,27); however, oncogenic p53 mutations can be found in advanced neuroblastomas that often relapse following high-dose chemotherapy (10). In contrast, in breast cancers, it has been reported that p53 mutations might improve response to high-dose chemotherapy including therapy with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (28).
An investigation into the p53 genomic status and functions of eight <span class="yellow">human</span> NB lines revealed that all five of the mutated cell lines had distinct genetic characteristics as is schematically represented in Figure 9: SK-N-BE(2) with a single missense mutation in the p53 gene, encoding a highly stable full-length protein. SK-N-AS and IGR-NB8 proteins, although they have intact transactivation and DBDs, were truncated at the C-terminus generating 341 and 326 amino acids respectively; they therefore lack the tetramerization domain that is essential for an active conformation. Very recently, Bourdon et al. (22) reported the putative occurrence of β and γ isoforms from different tissues due to alternate splicing that indicates the similarity to those of p73 and p63 as identified previously by Daniel Caput and co-workers (29). In the p53 isoforms scheme proposed by Bourdon et al. (22), the SK-N-AS cell line that elicits p53i9 protein expression is consistent with the p53β isoform. Genomic analysis reveals that the only occurrence of the p53β isoform in SK-N-AS results from a deletion spanning the intron 9/exon 10 junction. Similar to the p53β isoform in SK-N-AS, the p53 in IGR-NB8 that lacks 67 amino acids at C-terminus was, alone, unable to induce p21/WAF1 promoter activation except with endogenous wt-p53 on SH-SY5Y cells where transfection with IGR-NB8 significantly augmented the transcriptional activation of the p21/Waf-1 promoter (Figure 5A). Studies by other authors have reported the interaction between the C-terminal domain and another region that impedes the active conformation of p53, suggesting an allosteric model for p53 activity regulation (30). Such events have been demonstrated for the 342-stop mutant, generated by mutagenesis, which can modulate transactivation, growth and apoptosis (31). Moreover, Harms and Chen (32) reported that the C-terminal basic domain inhibits induction of the proapoptotic target gene insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3, suggesting that IGR-NB8 might induce this gene. IGR-N-91 had an abnormally high molecular weight protein due to the duplication of wild-type exons 7-8-9, thus affecting the DBD and OD; and LAN-1, with a mutation at codon 182 (Cys→stop) concurred with an earlier report showing extremely low levels of mRNA and undetectable protein expression (9).
Notably, all the p53 variants, including SK-N-AS (β isoform) and IGR-NB8 (C-terminal truncated p53), elicited a total lack of p21 promoter activation. In particular, the p53β isoform was unable to induce endogenous p21 expression in SK-N-AS (Figure 6), concurring with data obtained from in vitro transfection experiments in H1299 cells by Bourdon et al. (22). For the IGR-N-91 cells, although p53 was mutated and unable to transactivate the p21/WAF1 promoter, the FASAY global test was not conclusive since ∼80% of colonies were white and nearly 20% (see also Table 2), though not enough, were red. Moreover, in this particular line, standard sequencing on cDNA using primers located within each exon as used for routine tumor analysis was unable to detect any anomalies in p53 genetic status (data not shown). These results enlighten the limit of the conventional tests to detect a transcription inactivation of p53 brought by duplication within the DBD.
Analysis of p53 genomic status was explored by FISH experiments, in search for a potential biallelic inactivation of p53, with a mutation of one allele and a deletion of the second one. This situation was indeed clearly observed in IGR-N-91 and SK-N-AS cell lines, with an unambiguous loss of one chromosome 17p arm in all cells of both. SK-N-BE(2), LAN-1 and IGR-NB-8 cell lines showed a more complex genomic situation which should be relevant of variable copy numbers of chromosome 17 bearing in most cases (LAN-1) or in all cases [SKN-BE(2), IGR-NB8] the mutated characteristic p53 allele. Our data therefore clearly demonstrate that each technique has a role and a combination of techniques is required in order to correctly define the p53 phenotype and genotype in tumor and particularly in NB cells.
Our data enlighten a high frequency of the C-terminal abnormalities (3/5 mutated) in NB cell lines. For SK-N-AS and IGR-NB8, a part of the oligomerization domain was lost and IGR-N-91 gained an extra oligomerization domain. According to FASAY assay the p53 expressed in IGR-N-91 still specifically bind DNA but not the p53 expressed in SK-N-AS and IGR-NB8 in agreement with previous published data obtained by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (33).
With regards to biological relevance, different mutants within the DBD vary in their oncogenicity. They are classified into two types depending of the location of the mutation, mutations of class I occur in the DNA contact areas, while class II mutations occur in areas important for the conformational stability of p53 protein (30). Although both class I and class II mutants have loss its ability to specifically bind DNA, class II mutations have been shown to be more oncogenic than class I. However, to our knowledge the oncogenicity of mutant affecting the C-terminal domain have not been studied. The biological role of the C-terminal mutants needs now to be thoroughly investigated in NB tumors.<br><br>
<h3>pmcA2276505</h3>Port site herniation of the small bowel following laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy: a case report
Abstract
Introduction
Port-site herniation is a rare but potentially dangerous complication after laparoscopic surgery. Closure of port sites, especially those measuring 10 mm or more, has been recommended to avoid such an event.<br><br>Case presentation
We herein report the only case of a port site hernia among a series 52 consecutive cases of laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) carried out by our unit between July 2002 and March 2007. In this case the small bowel herniated and incarcerated through the port site on day 4 after LADG despite closure of the fascia. Initial manifestations experienced by the <span class="blue">patient</span>, possibly due to obstruction, and including mild abdominal pain and nausea, occurred on the third day postoperatively. The definitive diagnosis was made on day 4 based on symptoms related to leakage from the duodenal stump, which was considered to have developed after severe obstruction of the bowel. Re-operation for reduction of the incarcerated bowel and tube duodenostomy with peritoneal drainage were required to manage this complication.<br><br>Conclusion
We present this case report and review of literature to discuss further regarding methods of fascial closure after laparoscopic surgery.<br><br><br><br>Introduction
Bowel herniation through the fascial defect created by the entry of trocars is now recognized as a rare but potentially serious complication of laparoscopic surgery [1]. Although port site herniation is an infrequent complication, there are still some reports of port site herniation after these procedures, even with closure of trocar sites[1,2]. The following report describes a case of a trocar site hernia that evolved into leakage from the duodenal stump after laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG). Progression occurred because of complete obstruction of the incarcerated bowel after a Roux-en-Y reconstruction. We describe the significance of complete closure of the fascial defect at the trocar site including the peritoneum in the prevention of this condition, as well as the importance of early diagnosis to avoid serious subsequent events.<br><br>Case presentation
An 80-year-old <span class="yellow">man</span> was found to have early gastric cancer during his yearly check-up by gastrointestinal endoscopy. He was 158 cm in height and weighed 62 kg. Gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a depressed lesion that was diagnosed as early gastric cancer by pathological examination of biopsy specimens. He underwent LADG with regional lymph node dissection (D1 including the nodes surrounding the origin of left gastric artery). A 12-mm trocar for the laparoscope was placed in the umbilicus. Pneumoperitoneum was then established with carbon dioxide and the intraperitoneal pressure was maintained at 10 mm Hg. Two more 12-mm trocars were inserted in the midclavicular line below the costal margin and 2 cm above the umbilicus on each of both flanks and were used for active surgical instruments. All trocars used were the non-bladed type. The specimen was removed through a small medial incision which was 55 mm in length placed after resection of the stomach, and then Roux-en-Y reconstruction (RY) was carried out (Fig. 1). A tubular shaped drainage tube 10 mm in diameter was inserted and placed through the upper trocar site made on the right flank. Wound defect at the umbilical port site was sutured completely including the peritoneum with 0 absorbable suture and fascial incisions at all other trocar insertion sites were closed with 2-0 absorbable sutures. Surgical duration was 263 min, and the volume of blood loss was less than 50 mL with no blood transfusion.
Postoperatively, the <span class="blue">patient</span> complained of an acidic feeling in his stomach; however, there were no remarkable abnormalities on biochemical examination of serum. Radiological findings did not suggest bowel obstruction until 3 days postoperatively, although mild symptoms such as general malaise and vague abdominal pain were reported on day three. However, on day 4, the <span class="blue">patient</span> started to complain of upper abdominal pain and developed a high grade fever (38°C). Complete obstruction of the small bowel and leakage of contrast media were demonstrated by Gastrografin swallow and subsequent abdominal computed tomography (CT). CT also showed a mass lesion at the trocar insertion site on the upper left flank, suggesting herniation through the port site (Fig. 2). Marked dilatation of the duodenum including the horizontal part and second portion was observed. A diagnosis of staple failure of the stump of the duodenum and port-site herniation of the small bowel was made, and exploratory laparotomy was carried out. A small medial incision that had been made at the initial surgery was extended downward to the umbilicus to open the peritoneal cavity. As we expected, the small bowel was incarcerated into the peritoneal defect in the abdominal wall created by the trocar placed in the left upper flank leading to complete obstruction of the bowel (Fig. 3). Part of the jejunum 30 cm distal from the ligament of Treitz herniated around the fascial stitch, which still existed at the time of the re-exploration. The peritoneal cavity was contaminated with intestinal juice. Close examination after reduction of the incarcerated bowel did not demonstrate necrosis of the intestine, and thus, we decided not to resect this lesion. Leakage of intestinal juice through a pinhole fistula at the duodenal stump was also observed. Tube duodenostomy was performed with an omental patch used for closure of the fistula. The peritoneal defect was also closed. The postoperative course was fairly good without high output of the intestinal juice leakage or sepsis. The <span class="blue">patient</span> remained in the intensive care unit for 5 days after re-operation, and was then transferred to the general ward.<br><br>Discussion
Port-site herniation, which is one of the major complications after laparoscopic procedures [1], sometimes develops into serious complications, such as bowel obstruction due to incarceration into the fascial defect at the port site. Boughey et al. have reported four cases of Richter's hernia that occurred at a port site after laparoscopic surgery [1]. They reviewed previous reports and found the incidence to be 0.2 to 3%. A report describes the incidence of hernia as 0.23% for 10-mm trocar use, rising to 3.1% for the 12-mm trocar [2] suggesting that the wound created by a larger port carries a greater risk of herniation. Most surgeons now routinely close the fascia of port sites to prevent this complication [2]. According to previous reports, port site herniation apparently happens more often with the use of bladed type trocars than non-bladed type trocars [3]. Indeed, Kolata demonstrated that the wounds made by the non-bladed trocar were narrower than those created by cutting tip trocars in a <span class="yellow">pig</span> experimental model [4]. Several reports even concluded that port sites created by non-bladed trocars do not require fascial closure [3]. However, the current case suggests that thick preperitoneum is a potential space that allows for the development of bowel herniation even with the use of non-bladed type trocars. A previous report also described port-site herniation, despite the closure of the superficial layer of the fascial defect [5]. The current case did not demonstrate any of the risk factors suggested previously [6]; 1) enlargement of a port site to remove specimen; 2) glucose intolerance; 3) obesity; or 4) extensive manipulation of the trocar during relatively prolonged surgical duration, which might have enlarged the trocar site and thus induced bowel herniation. Therefore, we recommend closing the fascial defect, including the peritoneum, especially if the trocar size is more than 10-mm and in the presence of any of the risk factors described above. However, it is sometimes difficult to completely close the defect, including the peritoneum, especially in obese <span class="yellow">patients</span>. Shaher reviewed different wound closure techniques by a literature search [7]. In this review, old methods using classical instruments including Deschamps needle are also useful as well as special wound devices designed for port site closure. Elashry et al. described a prospective randomized study demonstrating that the Carter-Thomason device was faster and resulted in fewer port-closure-related complications among eight different techniques tested [8]. Insertion of a SURGICEL plug into the muscular layer of trocar wounds has also been proposed by Chiu et al [9]. Alternatively, tangential insertion of a trocar through the abdominal wall might be effective in reducing the size of fascial defects. Moreover, recent publications have demonstrated that radially expanding type trocars could be useful to avoid the necessity of closing the fascial defect [10].
Symptoms of trocar-site herniation vary depending on the severity of bowel obstruction. Mild symptoms such as slight nausea and vague abdominal pain, both of which are most frequently seen in the early normal postoperative course after abdominal surgery, could be the first and only complaints at the early stage of this complication. Thus, the diagnosis may be delayed. In our case, mild abdominal pain with general malaise might have been symptoms related to the early stage of the onset. Abdominal CT showing the enlarged duodenum also suggested that leakage from the duodenal stump occurred due to the obstruction of the distal bowel. Thus, severe complication might have been avoided, if early diagnosis had been made. Although the benefit of Roux-en-Y is apparent [11], the duodenal stump could be vulnerable to leakage due to increased intrabowel pressure. Therefore, careful management of the postoperative course is warranted, especially after procedures involving division of the bowel such as LADG. Moreover, special attention should be paid in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with risk factors for port site hernia such as obesity, aggressive manipulation through the port sites, and prolonged surgery.<br><br>Conclusion
Port-site herniation is a potentially dangerous complication after laparoscopic procedures. Careful management of the postoperative course is recommended especially for <span class="yellow">patients</span> with risk factors such as obesity and extensive manipulation of the trocar during prolonged surgical duration.<br><br>Competing interests

<h3>pmcA2518116</h3>CHEK2 Mutations Affecting Kinase Activity Together With Mutations in TP53 Indicate a Functional Pathway Associated with Resistance to Epirubicin in Primary Breast Cancer
Abstract
Background
Chemoresistance is the main obstacle to cure in most malignant diseases. Anthracyclines are among the main drugs used for breast cancer therapy and in many other malignant conditions. Single parameter analysis or global gene expression profiles have failed to identify mechanisms causing in vivo resistance to anthracyclines. While we previously found TP53 mutations in the L2/L3 domains to be associated with drug resistance, some tumors harboring wild-type TP53 were also therapy resistant. The aim of this study was; 1) To explore alterations in the TP53 gene with respect to resistance to a regular dose epirubicin regimen (90 mg/m2 every 3 week) in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with primary, locally advanced breast cancer; 2) Identify critical mechanisms activating p53 in response to DNA damage in breast cancer; 3) Evaluate in vitro function of Chk2 and p14 proteins corresponding to identified mutations in the CHEK2 and p14(ARF) genes; and 4) Explore potential CHEK2 or p14(ARF) germline mutations with respect to family cancer incidence.<br><br>Methods and Findings
Snap-frozen biopsies from 109 <span class="yellow">patients</span> collected prior to epirubicin (as preoperative therapy were investigated for TP53, CHEK2 and p14(ARF) mutations by sequencing the coding region and p14(ARF) promoter methylations. TP53 mutastions were associated with chemoresistance, defined as progressive disease on therapy (p = 0.0358; p = 0.0136 for mutations affecting p53 loop domains L2/L3). Germline CHEK2 mutations (n = 3) were associated with therapy resistance (p = 0.0226). Combined, mutations affecting either CHEK2 or TP53 strongly predicted therapy resistance (p = 0.0101; TP53 mutations restricted to the L2/L3 domains: p = 0.0032). Two <span class="yellow">patients</span> progressing on therapy harbored the CHEK2 mutation, Arg95Ter, completely abrogating Chk2 protein dimerization and kinase activity. One <span class="blue">patient</span> (Epi132) revealed family cancer occurrence resembling families harboring CHEK2 mutations in general, the other <span class="blue">patient</span> (epi203) was non-conclusive. No mutation or promoter hypermethylation in p14(ARF) were detected.<br><br>Conclusion
This study is the first reporting an association between CHEK2 mutations and therapy resistance in <span class="yellow">human</span> cancers and to document mutations in two genes acting direct up/down-stream to each other to cause therapy failure, emphasizing the need to investigate functional cascades in future studies.<br><br><br><br>Introduction
Chemoresistance is the main obstacle to cure in most malignancies, including breast cancer. While adjuvant chemotherapy may reduce the hazard rate of relapse by about one third in breast cancer <span class="yellow">patients</span> [1], the majority among <span class="yellow">patients</span> harboring micro- metastases are not cured by today's standards. Considering <span class="yellow">patients</span> harboring distant metastases, resistance and therapy failure inevitably occurs, in general over a time period of less than one year for each individual regimen [2].
Despite extensive experimental research [3], little data are available considering chemoresistance in vivo. For anthracycline therapy in breast cancer, topoisomerase-II amplifications have been associated with a dose-responsiveness different from what is observed in non-amplified tumors 4, 5. Several studies have tried to generate “prediction profiles” based on gene expression microarrays [6], [7], [8], however, none of the different profiles generated expressed a sensitivity suitable for clinical applications, or have been successfully reproduced by others (see references to original works in [9] and [10]).
p53 (the protein encoded by the TP53 gene) plays a key role in executing DNA-damage induced apoptosis and growth arrest [11]. Previously, our group reported mutations in the zink-binding domains L2 (codons 163–195) and L3 (codons 236–251) of p53 critical to DNA binding [12] to be associated with but not fully predictive for resistance to chemotherapy with a low-dose weekly anthracycline [13] or a mitomycin plus 5-fluoro-uracil containing [14] regimen. Similar findings were reported by another group [15]. In contrast, others reported TP53 mutations to predict sensitivity to a dose-dense epirubicin-cyclophosphamide regimen [16].
The finding that some tumors harboring wild-type TP53 may be resistant to anthracycline therapy lead us to postulate that other genes involved in the p53 pathway could be mutated in these tumors [3]. p53 is activated by post-translational modifications, and the protein is phosphorylated at multiple amino acids [17]. Phosphorylation at Ser 20 (Ser 23 in <span class="yellow">mice</span>) by the Chk2 protein (coded by the CHEK2 gene) in response to DNA damage activates p53 by inhibiting binding to, and deactivation by, the MDM2 (<span class="yellow">Mouse</span> Minute 2 homolog; HDM2) protein [18], [19], [20]. While experimental studies have suggested a critical role of Chk2 in activating p53 apoptotic response to genotoxic stress [21], [22], others claim Chk2 to be dispensable for p53 activation with respect to apoptosis as well as growth arrest [23]. Following an initial report of a CHEK2 germline mutation in a family filling the characteristics of a Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) [24], recent papers have suggested germline mutations in CHEK2 to be associated with a moderately increased risk of breast and colon cancers (see references in [25]). Recently, we discovered a somatic, nonsense CHEK2 mutation in a single <span class="blue">patient</span> expressing resistance to doxorubicin low dose therapy [26].
A second mechanism of p53 activation is through p14(ARF) (p19 in <span class="yellow">mice</span>) function. p14(ARF) does not phosphorylate p53, but inhibits MDM2 dependent p53 degradation through direct MDM2 binding. While p14(ARF)-mediated p53 activation has been linked to oncogene-induced p53 activation and, in general, considered not involved in response to DNA damage (see references in [27]), p14(ARF) may be activated through the E2F1/retinoblastoma pathway [28]. Importantly, two recent studies revealed lack of p19 (<span class="yellow">mouse</span> homologue of <span class="yellow">human</span> p14(ARF)) function in <span class="yellow">mice</span> to inhibit p53 tumor suppressor function in response to ionizing radiation as well as DNA damaging agents [29], [30].
The aim of this study was 1) to explore alterations in the TP53 gene with respect to resistance to a regular dose epirubicin regimen (90 mg/m2 body surface every 3 week) in <span class="blue">patient</span> with primary, locally advanced, breast cancer; 2) To explore defects in potential mechanisms activating p53 in response to DNA damage in breast cancer as a cause of drug resistance in wild-type tumors. To do so, we sequenced the complete coding regions for the CHEK2 and p14(ARF) genes and analyzed for p14(ARF) promoter hypermetylations; 3) Evaluate in vitro function of potential Chk2 and p14(ARF) protein translates corresponding to identified mutations in the CHEK2 and p14(ARF) genes; 4) Identify potential TP53, CHEK2 and p14(ARF) mutations to be germline, explore the incidence of different cancers among affected relatives with respect to specific mutations. By comparing in vitro characteristics of specific mutations to drug sensitivity and family cancer risk syndromes, this may add to our understanding of the importance of these gene cascades executing response to DNA damage versus tumor suppression activity.
Analyzing tumor samples from a total of 109 primary locally advanced breast cancer <span class="yellow">patients</span> treated with epirubicin 90mg/3 weekly, we found TP53 mutations affecting the L2/L3 domains or protein dimerization, as well as non-functional CHEK2 mutations abrogating dimerization and phosphorylation, to be associated with therapy resistance; no mutation or promoter hypermethylations of the p14(ARF) gene was discovered. Our findings suggest a critical role for Chk2 with respect to DNA-damage-dependent p53 activation and resistance to anthracycline therapy in <span class="yellow">human</span> breast cancer.<br><br>Materials and Methods
<span class="yellow">Patients</span>
A total of 223 <span class="yellow">patients</span> with locally advanced non-inflammatory breast cancer (T3-4 and/or N2) were randomly allocated to primary treatment either with epirubicin 90 mg/m2 or paclitaxel 200 mg/m2. The primary aim of the study was identification of markers predicting drug resistance to the regimens. Thus, the reason for randomizing <span class="yellow">patients</span> was not for effect comparison, but to achieve similar <span class="blue">patient</span> cohorts in the two arms. Based on the findings of a clinical lack of cross-resistance between anthracyclines and taxane therapies in breast cancer [31], we hypothesized the mechanisms of resistance to be different between the two compounds. While the analysis of tumor samples from the paclitaxel is ongoing, we here report our findings from the <span class="yellow">patients</span> allocated to the epirubicin arm.
The epirubicin arm included a total of 109 <span class="yellow">patients</span> (age 28 to 70 years, median 51 years). Two <span class="yellow">patients</span> were analyzed for gene mutations but omitted from statistical analysis as protocol violators; histopathological examination revealed one <span class="blue">patient</span> (Epi089) to harbor a sarcomatoid tumor, while one <span class="blue">patient</span> Epi232 was erroneously enrolled with stage II disease.
The study protocol was approved by the Regional Ethical Committee (Norwegian Health Region III), including formal Biobank registration in accordance to Norwegian law. The study and protocol is registered under the Norwegian Social Science Data services ((www.nsd/uib/personvern/database/), University of Bergen project no 16297 and Helse Bergen project no 13025). Each <span class="blue">patient</span> gave written informed consent.<br><br>Tissue Sampling
Before commencing chemotherapy, each <span class="blue">patient</span> had an incisional tumor biopsy as described previously [14]. All tissue samples were snap-frozen immediately on removal in the theatre.<br><br>Treatment Regime and Staging
Primary treatment consisted of epirubicin (90 mg/m2) administered as a 3-weekly schedule. Treatment was scheduled for four cycles unless progression occurred at an earlier stage. Clinical response was assessed before each treatment cycle, and the final response evaluated 3 weeks after the 4th cycle for overall response classification. Because the protocol was implemented by October 1997 with <span class="yellow">patients</span> enrolled between November 1997 and December 2003, responses were consistently graded by the UICC system [32] and not the more recently implemented “RECIST” criteria [33]. Thus, responses were classified as CR (Complete Response, complete disappearance of all tumor lesions), PR (Partial Response, reduction ≥50% in the sum of all tumor lesions, calculated for each as the product of the largest diameter and the one perpendicular to it), PD (Progressive Disease, increase in the diameter product of any individual tumor lesion by ≥25%), and SD (Stable Disease, anything between PR and PD). To analyze for the predictive value of the different parameters, similar to our previous studies [13], [14] we compared PD tumors (non responders) with the combined group of tumors classified as SD/PR/CR (responders); the reason for this approach is discussed in detail elsewhere [34]. Median follow-up time was defined from <span class="blue">patient</span> inclusion in the study up to October 31, 2006. Deaths attributable to causes other than breast cancer were treated as censored observations.
All <span class="blue">patient</span> records were subject to central audit for response classification (by E.L., B.Ø. and P.E.L.). Response classifications were completed and approved without any knowledge about result from laboratory analysis.<br><br>RNA Purification
Total RNA was purified by Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) extraction from snap-frozen tissue samples according to manufacturer's instructions. After extraction, the RNA was dissolved in 100 µl of DEPC treated ddH2O. cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using Transcriptor reverse transcriptase (Roche), according to the manufacturer's protocol.<br><br>DNA Purification
Genomic DNA from tumor biopsies and blood lymphocytes was isolated using QIAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.<br><br>Mutation Analysis
All mutational analysis was performed blinded to clinical data. Mutations in TP53, CHEK2 and p14(ARF) genes were analyzed by PCR (or nested PCR) amplification and sequencing of PCR product, or by cloning of PCR products and sequencing of the resulting plasmids (all primers described in Table 1). Cloning was performed using the TOPO TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen). Sequencing of clones was performed until at least 10 different sequences covered all parts of the CHEK2 coding sequence. DNA sequencing was carried out directly on 1 µl PCR product or plasmid using Big Dye terminator mix (Applied Biosystems). Capillary gel electrophoresis, data collection, and sequence analysis were done on an automated DNA sequencer (ABI 3700). When a mutation was detected, the relevant exon was amplified by PCR from genomic tumor DNA and DNA from blood lymphocytes and sequenced for verification and germline detection. (Primers described in Table 1).<br><br>Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)
Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in tumors with mutations in CHEK2 was assessed using the microsatellite marker, D22S275, which maps to intron 4 of CHEK2. LOH in tumors with mutation in TP53 was assessed using two markers, one variable number tandem repeat in intron 1 [35] and a CA repeat close to the TP53 gene [36]. Fluorescently end-labeled primers were used in the PCR, and the PCR products were analyzed on an ABI 3700. LOH was evaluated by comparing the allele peak-height ratios from blood DNA and tumor DNA. A sample was scored as having AI (Allelic Imbalance) when a reduction in peak height of one allele in tumor sample was at least 18% compared with that of blood DNA from the same <span class="blue">patient</span> [37].<br><br>Analysis of p14(ARF) promoter methylation
Genomic DNA was subjected to bisulphate conversion using the CpGenome DNA Modification Kit (Intergen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Both the unmethylated- and methylated-specific PCRs were performed in 50 µl reaction mixes containing 2.5 U AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase (Applied Biosystems), 1× PCR buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 0.2 µM of each primer (Table 1) and 2 µl of modified genomic DNA. Thermocycling conditions for both the unmethylated- and methylated-specific PCRs were an initial step of 5 minutes at 95°C followed by 35 cycles of 30 sec. at 94°C, 30 sec. at 60.5°C and 60 sec. at 72°C before a final elongation step at 72°C for 7 min.<br><br>Chk2 Dimerisation
Chk2 mutant's ability to form dimers with the wild-type protein was investigated by immunoprecipitation. U-2-OS cells were co-transfected with expression vectors expressing wild-type Chk2 with N-terminal Xpr-tag (pcDNA4/HisMax, Invitrogen) and mutated Chk2 forms with C-terminal V5-tag (pcDNA3.1/V5-His, Invitrogen). Transfection was performed using FuGene 6.0 transfection reagent (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested in lysisbuffer (50 mM TrisHCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40, 5 mM EDTA pH 8.0) 48 hours after transfection. An aliquote of the cell lysate was harvested for subsequent Chk2-mutant-V5 transfection verification. Samples were further incubated with A/G Pluss Agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4°C for 25 minutes before the beads were removed by centrifugation at 5000g for 4 minutes and the samples were incubated with 1.5 µg anti-V5 (Invitrogen) at 4°C for 90 minutes. Fresh A/G Pluss Agarose beads were added and the samples were incubated for another 90 minutes at 4°C. The beads were washed three times with 1×PBS, before being separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and blotted on to a nitrocellulose membrane. Chk2-wild-type-Xpr co-precipitated with Chk2-mutant-V5 was detected through incubations with anti-Xpr antibody (Invitrogen), HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL detection reagent (GE Healthcare).<br><br>Kinase Activity
Chk2 mutant's ability to function as kinases was investigated through an in vitro kinase assay. The V5 expression vectors used for the dimerisation study were also used to express Chk2 mutants in the kinase assay. U-2-OS cells were transfected using the FuGene 6.0 transfection reagent (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were then incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 and humidified atmosphere. After 24 hours doxorubicin (Nycomed Pharma) was added to the media to a final concentration of 50ng/ml and the cells were further incubated for 24 hours before harvest. 75 cm2 of 90% confluent cells were harvested in 500 µl lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EDTA), and the cytosol was incubated for 90 minutes at 4°C with 50 µl 50% Glutathione Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) linked to anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen). The beads were then washed twice with lysisbuffer containing 500 mM NaCl and twice with kinase assay buffer (50 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM MnCl2, 2.5 mM EGTA). The beads received 30 µl kinase assay buffer with 7.5 µM cold ATP, 10 µCi 32P-gamma-ATP (GE Healthcare) and 2 µg isolated Cdc25C peptide, and was incubated at 30°C for 30 minutes. Samples were separated on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel and blotted on to a nitrocellulose membrane. A radiosensitive imaging plate was exposed to the membrane and the plate was read in a FLA200 imager (Fuji).
The kinase assay described above was also used to determine the Chk2 mutants' kinase activity after co-transfection of each Chk2 mutant and wild-type Chk2 in equal amounts.<br><br>Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the Primer of Biostatistics system, version 5.0 [38]. The differences in the distribution of TP53 and CHEK2 mutations among <span class="yellow">patients</span> revealing a PD and the responders were analyzed with use of Fisher's exact test. P-values are reported as accumulated two-sided. Because of the limited time of the follow-up, no formal statistical assessment of overall survival was performed. Relapse-free survival was analyzed by the log-rank test. Details regarding outcome in individual <span class="yellow">patients</span> with mutations are shown in Table 2 and 3 to make them available to the reader.<br><br>
Results
TP53 Mutations and Response to Therapy
The TP53 mutations identified in the tumors of the <span class="yellow">patients</span> treated with epirubicin together with the clinical response to therapy and follow-up data are presented in Table 2. Somatic TP53 mutations were identified in 23 (21.5%) of the <span class="yellow">patients</span>. Normal tissue (WBC) was available from 18 of these for germline characterization, revealing none of the mutations identified to be germline alterations. Of the 23 mutations detected, 20 were missense and 3 were nonsense. One mutation (del483CAT) has not been reported previously either in breast cancer or in any other tumor type (IARC database: http://www.iarc.fr/p53/). Twelve of the mutations directly or indirectly affected the L2/L3 domains of the p53 protein (Table 2) previous found to predict a poor prognosis [39] and drug resistance [14], [40]. For statistical comparison, mutation Gly325Ter (<span class="blue">patient</span> Epi215) located to the tetramerization domain is grouped together with the mutations affecting the L2/L3 domain, since this mutation leads to truncation of the protein and with loss of tetramerization and functional defects similar to L2/L3 mutations [41].
There was a statistical significant correlation between TP53 mutation status and lack of treatment response (PD) (Table 4; p = 0.0358; Fisher exact test). When tumors harboring TP53 mutations affecting the p53 L2/L3 DNA-binding domains were compared to those with wild-type TP53 or TP53 mutations outside the L2/L3 domains, this correlation was further strengthened (p = 0.0136).
The previously described TP53 polymorphism, Arg72Pro [42] was detected in 31 (29%) of our <span class="yellow">patients</span>. No correlation was found between this polymorphism and lack of treatment response (p = 0.2750; Fisher exact test) or TP53 mutational status (p = 0.2024).<br><br>CHEK2 Mutations and Response to Therapy
Table 3 presents the <span class="yellow">patients</span> with detected CHEK2 mutations together with a description of the clinical response and follow up-data. CHEK2 mutations were identified in three out of the 109 <span class="yellow">patients</span> (2.8%). Notably, each of the CHEK2 mutations identified was also present in <span class="blue">patient</span> lymphocyte DNA, confirming a germline origin. The Arg95Ter (C283T) mutation is novel. This mutation was present in two <span class="yellow">patients</span> (Epi132 and Epi203) living in different parts of Norway with no known family relationship. However, linkage analysis using microsatellite markers (D22S275, D22S272, D22S1172 and D22S423) suggested a common founder mutation (data not shown). The C283T transition generates a novel stop codon in exon 1 of CHEK2, leading to truncation of the Chk2 protein. LOH analysis indicated loss of the wild-type CHEK2 allele in the both tumors from the two <span class="yellow">patients</span> harboring this mutation (Epi132 and Epi203). Both these tumors were non-responsive to epirubicin therapy (PD). In contrast, the third <span class="blue">patient</span> with a germline CHEK2 mutation (<span class="blue">patient</span> Epi151; point mutation at T1091C, Ile364Thr) had a partial response to epirubicin therapy. This tumor was non-informative with respect to LOH. Taking all CHEK2 mutations together, they predicted resistance to epirubicin (p = 0.0226).
The previously described silent Glu84Glu (A252G) polymorphism [24], [43] in exon 1 was detected in two (1.9%) <span class="yellow">patients</span>. No association between this polymorphism and treatment response was recorded.
One of the tumors (Epi203) harboring the C283T substitution (Arg95Ter) also harbored a somatic TP53 mutation in codon 175, Arg175His, located in the L2 domain of p53 (Table 2). This mutation was detected in another four of our <span class="yellow">patients</span> treated with epirubicin (Table 2). In addition, TP53 Arg175His mutation was recorded in one <span class="blue">patient</span> of our previous study evaluating response to doxorubicin [13]. The fact that none of the Arg175His <span class="yellow">patients</span> presented here or in our previous study revealed resistance to therapy (PD) suggests this mutation may not cause resistance to anthracyclines in breast cancers in vivo. Omitting the tumor harboring both a CHEK2 and a TP53 mutation (<span class="blue">patient</span> Epi203) from statistical analysis, Chk2 mutations (n = 2) were non-significantly associated with therapy resistance (p = 0.1633). In a previous study [26], however, we analyzed for CHEK2 mutation status in relation to therapy outcome in a cohort of <span class="yellow">patients</span> from doxorubicin study [13]. In that study [26], we detected the previously identified mutation Ile157Thr. In addition, we detected a novel nonsense somatic mutation (1368InsA). This mutation was associated with lack of function in vitro; moreover, it was associated with drug resistance in vivo. Analyzing our material and this cohort [26] together, (n = 160), CHEK2 mutations (n = 5 in total) predicted for resistance to doxorubicin and epirubicin therapy (p = 0.0123). Even though, excluding <span class="blue">patient</span> Epi203 (harboring TP53 Arg175His and Arg95Ter CHEK2 mutation) as well as other <span class="yellow">patients</span> harboring TP53 L2/L3 mutations (n = 129), CHEK2 mutations (n = 4 in total) predicted for resistance to doxorubicin and epirubicin therapy (p = 0.030).<br><br>TP53 and CHEK2 Mutations Combined and Response to Therapy
Assuming that TP53 and CHEK2 mutations may substitute for each other, we analyzed for the predictive effect of mutations in both genes. The occurrence of a mutation affecting either CHEK2 or TP53 strongly predicted therapy resistance (p = 0.0101; Fisher exact test). When tumors harboring TP53-L2/L3 mutations and CHEK2 mutations were compared with those wild-type or TP53 mutations outside the L2/L3 domain, the correlation was further strengthened (p = 0.0032; Fisher exact test). The significance was preserved when comparing <span class="yellow">patients</span> with a PD to objective responders (CR and PR) excluding <span class="yellow">patients</span> with stable disease (SD) from the statistical analysis (Table 4).<br><br>p14(ARF) Mutations and Promoter Methylations
Neither mutations nor polymorphisms in the coding region of p14(ARF) were observed among the 107 <span class="yellow">patients</span> analyzed. Likewise, no promoter methylations were detected.<br><br>Influence of CHEK2 and TP53 Mutation Status on Relapse-Free Survival
Because of the limited time of the follow-up, no formal statistical assessment of overall survival was performed. Details regarding outcome for individual <span class="yellow">patients</span> with mutations are described in Table 2 and 3 to make these data available to the reader. Relapse-free survival is depicted in (Figure 1). Figure 1A shows relapse-free survival for the <span class="yellow">patients</span> with TP53 and CHEK2 mutations (all mutations found) compared to <span class="yellow">patients</span> without any TP53 or CHEK2 mutations, no difference in relapse-free survival was observed. Similar, no difference was seen when grouping TP53 mutations outside L2/L3 and CHEK2 mutation not affecting kinase function (Ile364Thr) as wild-type (Figure 1B). Grouping tumors harboring a mutation in L2/L3 together with CHEK2 mutations affecting kinase domain (Arg95Ter) in one group, mutations outside TP53 L2/L3 and Ile364Thr as one group and tumors without any found mutations in TP53 and CHEK2 separately, again no noticeably difference in relapse-free survival were seen (Figure 1C). Notably, in addition to a short median follow-up time, a total of 35 <span class="yellow">patients</span> with a sub-optimal response to epirubicin received subsequent treatment with paclitaxel, which may have influenced the outcome.<br><br>CHEK2 Mutant's Capability to Form Dimers
To investigate whether the identified CHEK2 mutations affect the ability of the Chk2 protein to form dimers, co-transfection and immunopresipitation of V5-tagged mutants and Xpress-tagged wild-type Chk2 were performed using CHEK2 low-expressing U-2-OS cells. As we identified the previously characterized CHEK2 germline mutants variants Arg117His (n = 2 and Ile157Thr (n = 1) among <span class="yellow">patients</span> allocated to primary treatment with paclitaxel in our ongoing study, these mutants were evaluated together with Arg95Ter and Ile364Thr. The results presented in Figure 2 show that all Chk2 variants carrying a point mutation were able to form dimers with wild-type Chk2, whereas the Arg95Ter variant was not.<br><br>Kinase Activity of CHEK2 Mutants
To investigate whether the identified CHEK2 mutants retained the wild-type kinase activity, an in vitro Chk2 kinase assay with respect to Chk2 autophosphorylation and Cdc25 substrate phosphorylation was performed. The U-2-OS cells were preferred for this assay because they were previously found to express only low levels of endogenous Chk2 [44]. This was confirmed by us using an antibody recognizing endogenous protein (data not shown). These cells have previously been used by other investigators to study Chk2 kinase activity [44], [45], [46].
The two mutants Arg117Gly and Ile157Thr were previously tested for in vitro kinase activity [47], but were both included here, together with wild-type CHEK2 as controls. Compared to wild-type Chk2, the Ile157Thr mutant retained wild-type kinase activity. The mutant Ile364Thr showed partially reduced kinase activity both in term of Cdc25-phosphorylation and autophosphorylation (Figure 3). In contrast, the mutant Arg117Gly showed strongly reduced kinase activity while the Arg95Ter mutant was totally devoid of any Chk2 kinase activity. The activity recorded for Ile157Thr and Arg117Gly was consistent with previously reported results for these two mutants [47]. Notably, there was an internal consistency with respect to percentage activity reduction comparing individual mutants with respect to autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of Cdc25 (Figure 3).
Since enzymatically active Chk2 exists as dimers, it was important to determine the effect of Chk2 mutants on wild-type/mutant heterodimer kinase activity. The effect on Chk2 kinase activities (Chk2 autophosphorylation and Cdc25 substrate phosphorylation) of the individual mutants were therefore determined after co-transfection with wild-type Chk2 as described in Materials and Methods. The results from this co-transfection-kinase assay (Figure 4) were similar to those of the single-transfection assay (Figure 3) except in the case of the Arg117Gly mutant, which expressed a substantial kinase activity when complexed with wild-type Chk2. This is consistent with previous data indicating that the Arg117Gly mutant has neglectable kinase activity itself but dimerizes efficiently to Chk2 wild-type without strongly affecting the wild-type Chk2 activity. Hence, the activity detected is probably caused by the co-transfected and co-precipitated wild-type protein.
To rule out the possibility that endogenously expressed wild-type Chk2 contributed to observed Arg117Gly kinase activity shown in Figure 4, we compared the Arg117Gly variant activity in the presence or absence of co-transfected wild-type Chk2 to the activities of Arg95Ter under the same conditions. The Arg95Ter variant does not form dimers with wild-type Chk2. As seen in Figure 5, Arg117Gly, which forms dimers with Chk2 wild-type, allows increased activity when co-transfected with wild-type as compared to the corresponding activity for the Arg95Ter mutant. The fact that Arg117Gly, when transfected alone, displays very similar activity as Arg95Ter or negative control (background levels), strongly indicates that the contribution of endogenous Chk2, which, similarly to exogenously expressed wild-type Chk2 co-precipitate with Arg117Gly is non-significant.<br><br>Family Cancer Incidence in Relation to CHEK2 Germline Mutations
Following an initial report of a family with a CHEK2 germline mutation expressing an increased cancer incidence resembling the Li-Fraumeni syndrome [24], recent studies have revealed the more common CHEK2 mutations to be associated with a moderately increased risk of breast and colorectal cancers. We hypothesized that CHEK2 mutations having a detrimental effect on drug sensitivity could be associated with a more aggressive, Li-Fraumeni or a Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) cancer syndrome [48]. Except from the <span class="blue">patient</span> harboring the Ile364Thr mutation who did not have any known congestion of cancer disease in the family, a detailed assessment of family cancer history was performed for each <span class="blue">patient</span> harboring a germline CHEK2 mutation. The family cancer pedigrees are depicted in Figure 6.
While <span class="yellow">patients</span> harboring CHEK2 germline mutations revealed different types of cancers (mainly breast and tumors of the gastrointestinal area) in their family, surprisingly, no distinct pattern discriminating families harboring the Arg95Ter mutation from the other CHEK2 mutated families could be identified. One of them (Epi203), who inherited the mutation from her father's side of the family, had no accumulation of either breast or colorectal cancer on that side. It should be noted, however, that two brothers of her fathers mother had prostate cancer, and two siblings of his father having hepatocellular carcinoma and bladder cancer, respectively), while the other expressed a disease pattern resembling what has been seen with the more common CHEK2 mutations, like del1100C [25].<br><br>
Discussion
TP53 plays a key role as a tumor suppressor gene. Its protein product activates processes such as growth arrest, DNA repair, apoptosis and/or senescence in response to genotoxic damage as well as oncogene activity [49], [50]. Despite being extensively studied, critical issues regarding regulation of the p53 protein remain poorly understood, and conflicting evidence obtained in different experimental systems make the clinical relevance of experimental data questionable.
Chemoresistance is the main obstacle to cancer cure in most malignancies, including breast cancer. Previously, we found TP53 mutations affecting the L2/L3 DNA binding domain to be associated with lack of responsiveness to doxorubicin monotherapy [13] as well as mitomycin and 5-fluoro-uracil in concert [14]. However, some tumors revealed therapy resistance despite harboring wild-type TP53. Postulating that these tumors may harbor genetic disturbances in genes playing a key role in the p53 pathway, we here sequenced TP53 along with CHEK2 and p14(ARF), the latter two known to play a critical role as p53 activators, in tumors from 109 <span class="yellow">patients</span> treated with epirubicin monotherapy. Our results confirm TP53 mutations, in particular those affecting the L2/L3 domains, to be associated with drug resistance. Most importantly, we also found CHEK2 mutations generating a non-functional protein in our in vitro assays to be associated with drug resistance. In contrast, none of our tumors harbored either mutations or expressed promoter hypermethylations affecting the p14.
Based on in vitro assays, we were able to classify the different Chk2 mutants with respect to dimerization capability as well as kinase activity (Chk2 autophosphorylation and Cdc25 substrate phosphorylation). In addition, the kinase activities of the Chk2 wild-type/mutant complexes were monitored in co-transfection experiments. Notably, each point mutation (except for Arg117Gly) revealed similar relative kinase efficacy whether co-transfected with wild-type Chk2 or not (Figure 3 and 4). Cells co-transfected with Arg117Gly and wild-type Chk2 revealed kinase activity, probably due to the contribution of the wild type protein in Chk2 mutant – wild-type heterodimers. In contrast, cells transfected with Arg95Ter revealed no kinase activity whether co-transfected with wild-type Chk2 or not, clearly distinguishing this mutation from the others (Figure 3 and 5).
All in vitro assays were based on transfection of the U-2-OS cell line, a cell line known to express wild-type Chk2 at low levels, and previously used by other investigators to study Chk2 activity [44], [45], [46]. Since we were not able to obtain satisfactory technical quality of the kinase assay in cell lines negative for Chk2 (HCT 15 and HCT 116), we assessed potential background kinase activity due to endogenous Chk2 by performing western blot analysis revealing the endogenous levels of Chk2 in U-2-OS cells to be non-significant compared to the exogenously expressed Chk2 levels (data not shown). We also performed a separate kinase assay, directly comparing the effect of binding partners for the dimerizing Arg117Gly and the non-dimerizing Arg95Ter. This assay also revealed the contribution of endogenous Chk2 to be non-significant (Figure 5).
Taking our in vitro findings together with in vivo observations, our present data confirm that the functionally defective CHEK2 Arg95Ter mutation, together with LOH, is associated with resistance to anthracycline therapy. In contrast, the <span class="blue">patient</span> harboring the Ile364Thr mutation, moderately reducing phosphorylation activity, responded well to therapy. The other missense mutations; Arg117Gly and Ile157Thr were observed among <span class="yellow">patients</span> receiving paclitaxel therapy only; thus, their influence on anthracycline sensitivity in vivo could not be addressed. Yet, based on the finding that the Arg117Gly mutant expressed no intrinsic activity, but readily dimerized to the wild-type protein without abolishing its activity, we hypothesize that this mutation and, probably, other yet unidentified CHEK2 mutations with a similar lack of intrinsic kinase activity, may cause resistance to anthracycline therapy if combined with LOH in breast cancer.
Our present findings have two major implications. First, we confirm that mutations in genes encoding proteins located within the same functional pathway may substitute for each other with respect to drug sensitivity, revealing for the first time a functional pathway critical to chemotherapy response in vivo. Second, the identification of mutations in the CHEK2 but not in the p14(ARF) gene in resistant tumors suggests that Chk2 mediated phosphorylation of p53 is a critical event in executing anti-tumor effect as a response to DNA damaging agents in breast cancer. This adds to our understanding not only of the function of p53 but Chk2 as well. p53 undergoes phosphorylation at multiple sites by different kinases, including Chk2 [51]. While activation of the ATM leading to direct (Ser 15) and Chk2-mediated (Ser 20) phosphorylation of p53 is considered an important mechanism for triggering p53 activation in response to DNA damage [52], some reports suggest ATM [53] and even Chk2 [23] to be redundant to this function. Importantly, Chk2 has been shown capable of inducing ATM-independent apoptosis in vitro [21]. While Chk2 phosphorylates p53 at Ser 20, thereby stabilizing p53 by preventing MDM2 binding [19], Chk2 also phosphorylates p53 at six additional sites, including Ser 313 and Ser 314 located in the nuclear localization signal domain of p53 [51]. In addition, Chk2 phosphorylates other important targets like BRCA1, Cdc25A and Cdc25C involved in DNA repair, G1 and G2 arrest, respectively [54]. Despite the wide range of known Chk2 substrates relevant for DNA repair and cell cycle control, our present findings that CHEK2 mutations leading to non-functional Chk2 protein may substitute for p53 mutations strongly advocate a role for Chk2 with respect to drug sensitivity executed through p53 activation.
Notably, one of the tumors (Epi203) with the Arg95Ter CHEK2 mutation in addition harbored a somatic TP53 mutation, Arg175His, with allelic imbalance for the TP53 gene (Table 2). Importantly, among another four <span class="yellow">patients</span> in this study (Epi063, Epi071, Epi087, Epi153) and one <span class="blue">patient</span> from our previous doxorubicin protocol [13] harboring the Arg175His mutation together with allelic imbalance for TP53, all five of these <span class="yellow">patients</span> responded to anthracycline therapy either with a partial response or stable disease. In contrast, Epi132 and the only <span class="blue">patient</span> for whom we previously identified a non-functional CHEK2 mutation (1368InsA; coding for a non-functional protein translate with cytoplasmic location [26]) expressed resistance to epirubicin and doxorubicin, respectively. Arg175His is a p53 “hot-spot” structural mutation reported to have defects with respect to transcriptional activation and also to negatively interact with wild-type p53 [55]. While this mutation has been shown to enhance chemoresistance upon transfection into p53 null Saos-2 cells [56], these osteosarcoma-derived cells may not necessarily be representative for breast cancers in vivo. Recent evidence strongly support p53 to be involved also in non-transcriptional mediated apoptosis by interacting with the Bcl-2/Bax system [57], and transcription-defect structural p53 mutants have been shown to execute non-transcriptional apoptosis in experimental systems [58]. Concomitant inactivation of Chk2 and p53 in breast cancer has been recorded by others [59], and the finding that a somatic mutation may generate a “growth advantage” in tumor cells already harboring a germline CHEK2 mutation may not implicate an effect on drug sensitivity in tumors not yet exposed to cytotoxic compounds. Rather, it may indicate a growth advantage, probably related to loss of p21 function. Notably, in a previous study we found the p21 polymorphism G251A to be associated with an increased risk of developing large breast cancers but to have no effect on drug sensitivity [60], indicating that growth rate and drug resistance may be regulated independently. Taken together, we believe our findings advocate a role for Chk2 in executing cellular response to anthracycline-induced DNA damage.
As mentioned above, removing TP53 mutated tumors including the double-mutated Epi203 from statistical analysis, CHEK2 mutation status still predicted for resistance to anthracycline therapy. In addition, removing the tumors harboring the Arg175His mutation from the p53 “L2/L3” group strengthened the correlation to lack of treatment response to epirubicin (p = 0.0005).
Comparing the effects of mutations in the CHEK2 gene to TP53 mutations indirectly underlines the importance of the role of Chk2 to chemoresistance. Our present findings as well as results from our previous studies [13], [14] revealed that about 50% of the <span class="yellow">patients</span> with tumors harboring TP53 L2/L3 mutations to be non-responders to primary therapy. In contrast, all our three <span class="yellow">patients</span> harboring a non-functional CHEK2 mutation (the two Arg95Ter mutated <span class="yellow">patients</span> here and our previous <span class="blue">patient</span> harboring the 1368InsA) expressed primary resistance to therapy. We previously hypothesized that therapy response in tumors harboring TP53 L2/L3 mutations could be due to redundant pathways acting in concert [3]. Although no definite conclusion should be drawn from a limited number of observation, the fact that Chk2 not only phosphorylates p53 but also phosphorylates other substrates such as Cdc25A and Cdc25C [54] and E2F1 in response to etoposide-induced DNA damage [61] may indicate that inactivation of redundant pathways could take place in parallel.
The literature remains inconsistent with respect to whether the border amino acids 163, 195, 236 and 251 should be included in the p53 L2 and L3 domains [12]. Taking a conservative approach, we classified <span class="blue">patient</span> Epi56, harboring a mutation in codon 163, as a L2/L3 mutant. The <span class="blue">patient</span> harboring this mutation responded to therapy (PR). If this mutation was classified as outside the L2 domain, our p-value had been strengthened from p = 0.0136 to p = 0.0096.
Germline mutations in TP53 cause the Li-Fraumeni and Li-Fraumeni-like cancer disposition syndromes. However, while the germline and somatic mutations associated with these syndromes reveal a preference for the same codons [48], TP53 mutations affecting the DNA-binding domains seem associated with a poor prognosis [62], [63], [64] and, in particular, drug resistance [14], [40] in breast cancer. Thus, tumor suppression and tumor cell response to chemotherapeutics may involve different parts of p53 protein function. Following an initial report identifying a CHEK2 mutation in a family expressing characteristics of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome [65], recent evidence has linked CHEK2 founder mutations to a moderately increased risk of breast- and colorectal cancers with some additional disposition for other malignancies as well [66]. However, cancer incidence and phenotypes did not reveal an aggressive Li-Fraumeni or Li-Fraumeni-like tumor pattern. Similar to the two <span class="yellow">patients</span> in our paclitaxel treatment arm harboring the rare but previously characterized mutation Arg117Gly and the <span class="blue">patient</span> with the Ile157Thr mutation, they expressed a moderately increased risk of breast and gastrointestinal cancers (Fig. 6). Thus, CHEK2 resembles TP53 in as much as there seems to be no direct correlation between effects of individual mutations with respect to tumor suppression and drug resistance.
Our finding that TP53 mutations located to the DNA-binding domains predicts drug resistance may indicate transcriptional mechanisms to be involved in drug-induced cell death. p53 induced apoptosis has been associated with transcriptional induction of genes including Puma and Noxa as well as Bax in experimental systems [55], [67], [68]. Yet, recent evidence has revealed p53 to induce apoptosis through non-transcriptional mechanisms by direct protein interactions with members of the Bcl-2/Bax system and mitochondrial release of cytochrom c [57], [69]. In deed, there is evidence that the DNA-binding domains, in particular the L3 part of the protein, may be critical also to transcriptional-independent apoptosis [70]. Of particular note is the finding that Chk2 may regulate transcriptional-independent p53-mediated apoptosis in response to DNA-damage created through ionizing irradiation [71]. Interestingly, Krajewski et al [72] reported low expression of Bax assessed by immunostaining to be associated with a low response to chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer. Although no conclusion should be drawn at this stage, together these findings are consistent with the challenging hypothesis that transcription-independent activation of Bax following Chk2-phosphorylation may represent a key pathway in p53 dependent cell death in breast cancer in vivo.
p14 acts by releasing p53 from MDM2 binding, and has been related to oncogene-induced p53 activation [73]. Recently, p14 was shown to affect p53 by additional mechanisms, including acetylations [74], response to ionizing radiation in <span class="yellow">human</span> fibroblasts [75], and tumor-suppression following ionizing radiation in <span class="yellow">mice</span> [76], [77]. These findings further links the retinoblastoma and p53 pathways [28]. As such, we believe the negative finding with respect to its role in chemoresistance adds important information.
Contrasting earlier findings by us and others [15], a recent study revealed TP53 mutations to be associated with increased likelihood of having a complete response to chemotherapy [16]. These results may not necessarily be at conflict. In the latter study, <span class="yellow">patients</span> received treatment with a “dose-dense” chemotherapy regimen; if confirmed, the combined data may outline a therapeutic indication for aggressive dose-dense therapy based on tumor TP53/CHEK2 status.
So far attempts to identify single markers and, more recently, gene expression arrays predicting chemoresistance have not proved successful (see refs in [9], [10]). The findings presented here reveal for the first time defects in a functional gene cascade to be associated with drug resistance in a <span class="yellow">human</span> cancer in vivo. Moreover, the findings are made in breast cancer, the most frequent malignant disease among <span class="yellow">women</span> in the industrialized world, and relate to resistance to anthracyclines, the type of cytotoxic compounds most frequently employed for this malignancy.
While the only study we are aware of comparing TP53 mutation status in primaries and their distant metastases suggested an increasing fraction of tumors to express mutated TP53 during progression [78], we do not know the potential contribution of either TP53 or CHEK2 mutations to drug resistance in micrometastases or in metastatic disease. Yet the finding that one of our non-functional CHEK2 mutations associated with chemoresistance (1368InsA) occurred as a somatic, not germline mutation, suggest such mutations may be selected for during tumor progression. We propose the findings presented here provide important beacons identifying a functional pathway [3] likely to be disturbed through different mechanisms in relation to therapy resistance in advanced disease.
In conclusion, we believe our findings here that mutations in the TP53 and CHEK2 genes each may cause resistance to anthracycline therapy in primary tumors to have wide implications to future research in this area. While results from experimental systems are mandatory generating hypotheses, conflicting data from in vitro studies underlines the pivotal role of identifying defects associated with therapy resistance in vivo. Either through mutations of the genes themselves, or inactivation of this functional cascade through co-factors, we believe identification of the Chk2 – p53 axis as critical to anthracycline therapy response provides a functional clue for further investigations in this area.<br><br>

The group D enterococci include three main species <span class="yellow">S. faecalis</span>, <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span>, and <span class="yellow">S. durans</span>. <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span> cause a minority of all cases of enterococcal endocarditis, in those instances in which enterococci have been speciated [3], but they have been more resistant both to penicillin and penicillin-aminoglycoside combinations than <span class="yellow">S. faecalis</span> [4,5,6]. <br><br> We describe a 64-year-old <span class="yellow">man</span> with <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span> endocarditis in whom a six-week course of ampicillin and tobramycin, followed by additional courses of penicillin and other aminoglycosides, failed to eradicate the organism from the <span class="blue">patient</span>'s mitral valve. This case is of interest because therapeutic failure of ampicillin and tobramycin in <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span> endocarditis has not been reported previously, but might have been predicted on the basis of previous in vitro and in vivo studies [6]. Although the need for both a penicillin derivative and an aminoglycoside in the therapy of enterococcal endocarditis is widely known, it is important to distinguish between the differing efficacies of penicillin-aminoglycoside combinations for treating various species of enterococci such as <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span>. <br><br> 243 <br><br> Address reprint requests to: Judith A.

He received oral erythromycin for 14 days with transient improvement of symptoms. However, after completing therapy, symptoms reappeared and he noted a 15-pound weight loss with low-grade fever (99-100.5?F) during the two months preceding admission. There was no previous history of rheumatic or congenital heart disease. <br><br> In March 1981, the <span class="blue">patient</span> was admitted to his community hospital where evaluation revealed a new apical systolic murmur radiating to the axilla. There were no petechiae, Janeway lesions, Osler's nodes, Roth spots, or splenomegaly. The hematocrit was 34.8 percent, WBC count 9,300 cells per cu mm with a differential count of 67 segmented forms, 9 bands, 15 lymphocytes, 7 monocytes, 1 eosinophil, and 1 basophil. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 62 mm per hour (nl < 10 mm per hour) and the serum rheumatoid factor titer was 1:320. Chest films and electrocardiogram were reportedly normal. Group D streptococci grew from three sets of blood cultures. Enterococcal endocarditis was diagnosed and he was treated with six weeks of parenteral ampicillin (12 grams per day) and tobramycin (3 mg per kg per day). Resolution of symptoms occurred within several days after antibiotics were begun. Serum bactericidal titers against the organism, obtained during peak antibiotic levels, were 1:8 or greater on several occasions, and blood cultures were negative while the <span class="blue">patient</span> was receiving antibiotics. M-mode echocardiography demonstrated left atrial enlargement but no definable abnormalities of the mitral or aortic valves. Intravenous pyelogram, oral cholecystogram, cystoscopy, liver-spleen scan, and upper and lower gastrointestinal series were normal except for a few sigmoid diverticuli. Flexible signoidoscopy demonstrated both a small perianal fissure and hemorrhoids. Blood cultures two weeks after therapy were negative. <br><br> Second Admission (June 19-August 4, 1981) <br><br> In June 1981, he again noted intermittent fever, night sweats, and fatigue. Group D streptococci grew from three sets of blood cultures and he was admitted to the West Haven VA Medical Center for recurrent endocarditis. On examination a somewhat louder apical systolic murmur was noted. The ESR was 50 mm/hour and rheumatoid factor titer was 1:320. Serum complement levels were normal and cryoglobulins were not detectable. Chest films, EKG, and urinalysis were normal. Cardiac M-mode echocardiogram revealed a globular mass attached to the posterior mitral valve leaflet with prolapse into a slightly enlarged left atrium. A twodimensional echocardiogram confirmed mitral valve prolapse and suggested a posterior leaflet vegetation. Gallium citrate scan was negative. <br><br> Three separate morphologic colony variants were isolated from blood, each identified as <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span> by Dr. R.R. Facklam (Center for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia). The <span class="blue">patient</span> received intravenous penicillin (20 million units per day) and gentamicin (3 mg per kg per day) for six weeks with improvement. Peak serum bactericidal titers of 1:8 or greater were achieved against two of the colony variants; however, against the large colony morphotype, a titer of only 1:2 was obtained. An enlarged left atrium with intermittent fluttering and prolapse of the mitral valve was noted on echocardiography three weeks into therapy. Multiple blood cultures taken while the <span class="blue">patient</span> was receiving antibiotics were negative, as were those obtained 48 and 72 hours after discontinuation of antibiotics. <br><br> 244 <br><br> <span class="yellow">S. FAECIUM</span> ENDOCARDITIS <br><br> Third Admission (August 12-October 4, 1981) <br><br> Withing a week following discharge, the <span class="blue">patient</span> again developed fever, nocturnal sweats, and malaise. <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span> (large colony morphotype, and poorly growing small colony morphotype) grew from six sets of blood cultures obtained on admission. Penicillin (30 million units/day) and gentamicin (3 mg/kg/day) were again administered, initially achieving peak serum inhibitory and bactericidal dilutions of 1:16 and 1:8 against the organism, respectively. However, the organism had a lowlevel resistance to streptomycin (MIC < 125 /Ag/ml), and streptomycin (2 grams per day) was substituted for gentamicin two weeks into antibiotic therapy. Repeat echocardiograms showed irregular and shaggy densities of both mitral valve leaflets with partial prolapse. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated marked mitral valve prolapse with mitral regurgitation. A radiolucent filling defect was noted, suggesting a coronary artery embolus at the origin of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, causing 75 percent occlusion of the lumen. The <span class="blue">patient</span> underwent mitral valve replacement, receiving a number 31 porcine Hancock bioprosthesis and bypass graft to the midportion of the LAD. The mitral valve was thickened with several ruptured chordae of the posterior leaflet noted, but no vegetations. The aortic valve appeared normal, with no visible septal or ring abscesses. The occlusion in the LAD was not approached to avoid embolizing distal fragments. <br><br> Histopathologically the mitral valve showed mild fibrosis and myxoid degeneration without inflammatory changes. Bacterial and fungal stains were negative but <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span> grew from fragments of the resected valve. Following surgery the <span class="blue">patient</span> received six additional weeks parenteral penicillin and streptomycin. Repeat blood cultures on this regimen and following therapy were negative.

Following combined therapy with ampicillin and tobramycin and relapse of endocarditis, three morphological variants were isolated from blood cultures and also evaluated. <br><br> Twenty-four hour time-kill curves for penicillin in combination with various aminoglycosides were performed by Dr. Robert Moellering on the <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span> isolated from the <span class="blue">patient</span>'s blood immediately prior to mitral valve excision and replacement (Fig. 1). Synergy was readily demonstrable against this organism by penicillin-streptomycin and penicillin-gentamicin combinations in vitro, but not by penicillin-tobramycin. <br><br> DISCUSSION <br><br> Among streptococci, the enterococci are unusual in their relative resistance to a broad spectrum of antimicrobial agents, and single-agent therapy is rarely bactericidal against them [2]. Since Hunter's original observations in 1947, it has become increasingly clear that effective synergistic combinations of antibiotics are necessary to successfully treat enterococcal endocarditis [1]. <br><br> Although <span class="yellow">S. faecalis</span> represents the majority of clinical enterococcal isolates, <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span> nonetheless comprises 5-10 percent of these isolates in some series [3,4]. Moreover, major differences exist in antimicrobial susceptibility and resistance to penicillin-aminoglycoside synergism between these two enterococcal species. The MIC of penicillin against <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span> is higher and this organism is more resistant to a number of different combinations of penicillin and various aminoglycosides than is <span class="yellow">S. faecalis</span> [6]. <br><br> The mechanisms of resistance exhibited by enterococci to penicillin-aminoglycoside synergy have been investigated. Clinically achievable levels of amino<br><br> 246 <br><br> <span class="yellow">S. FAECIUM</span> ENDOCARDITIS <br><br> glycosides are generally ineffective against enterococci. This intrinsic low-level resistance (MIC c 250 isg/ml) is thought to be the result of poor antibiotic penetration of the bacterial cell wall. However, in the presence of antibiotics that interfere with cell wall synthesis, there is enhanced aminoglycoside uptake [7]. In concert, these events are the basis for penicillin-aminoglycoside synergism. Ribosomal resistance of the 30S subunit to streptomycin and defective uptake of gentamicin in the presence of penicillin have been reported mechanisms of resistance among enterococcal isolates [8,9]. However, in the majority of instances, failure of synergy involves plasmid-mediated production of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. For streptomycin and kanamycin, plasmid-mediated enzymatic inactivation confers high-level resistance (MIC > 2,000 Ag/ml) and correlates with failure of these aminoglycosides to exert a synergistic effect when combined with penicillin [10,11]. Plasmid-mediated modifying enzymes have been found in both <span class="yellow">S. faecalis</span> and <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span>' [12]. Currently, approximately one-half of clinical enterococcal isolates demonstrate high-level resistance to streptomycin and kanamycin [13]. <br><br> Combinations of penicillin with kanamycin, tobramycin, sisomicin, and netilmicin have consistently failed to demonstrate synergistic killing of <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span> in vitro [6]. This failure of synergy occurs even when high-level resistance to these aminoglycosides is not present. The mechanism of resistance appears to be related to the production of an inactivating enzyme that acetylates the aminoglycoside substrate at the 6' position1 [14]. The genetic basis for production of this enzyme has not been well-defined and plasmid transfer experiments have thus far been unsucessful in demonstrating the encodement of this enzyme by extrachromosomal DNA [14]. <br><br> Moellering et al. demonstrated in vivo, utilizing the <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> model of endocarditis, that penicillin and netilmicin were not efficacious in the treatment of endocarditis caused by a low-level aminoglycoside-resistant strain of <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span> [6]. Although combinations of penicillin with tobramycin, kanamycin, or sisomicin were not evaluated, the authors postulated that the same ineffectual result would have occurred. In the present case, the recurrence of <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span> endocarditis after six weeks of therapy with ampicillin and tobramycin confirms the therapeutic and clinical significance of their data, and emphasizes that tobramycin is not an aminoglycoside to be used for treatment of serious <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span> infections. <br><br> Bacterial tolerance has been suggested as a possible basis for therapeutic failures, particularly in the treatment of infections caused by <span class="yellow">Staphylococcus aureus</span> with defects in the production of autolysins. MBCs are generally several-fold higher than MICs and this phenomenon appears to be associated with the autolysin defect [5]. Lorian has also described the formation of numerous aberrant cross-walls by <span class="yellow">S. faecalis</span> grown in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of penicillin [15]. MBCs were only slightly higher than MICs for the three <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span> variants obtained from our <span class="blue">patient</span>, and they did not appear to be tolerant strains of <span class="yellow">S. faecium</span>. There was no evidence that any of the morphological variants isolated were unusually resistant to antibiotics. Therefore, subsequent failure of therapy could not be explained on the basis of antibiotic resistance patterns. The initial failure of ampicillin and tobramycin therapy may have allowed the infecting organism to become better established and more difficult to eradicate from the valve.

Relapse of endocarditis might have been anticipated on the basis of previous experimental data showing lack of synergy when tobramycin is used against this organism. This case graphically illustrates the relevance of synergy studies to therapeutic considerations in the treatment of endocarditis. However, subsequent therapy with synergistic combinations of antibiotics did not result in cure. The data do not implicate tolerant organisms as a cause for relapses. Failure of therapy may have been related to the presence of protected organisms in vegetations which were seen on echocardiograms, and also suggested by the presence of a possible coronary artery embolus seen on coronary arteriograms. <br><br> In conclusion, speciation of isolates suspected of causing endocarditis and adequate synergy studies of antibiotic combinations are indicated before a long and expensive course of therapy with antimicrobial agents is undertaken for this disease. However, as this case also illustrates, demonstration of synergism in vitro does not assure clinical cure. <br><br> ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS <br><br> Dr. Goldstein was supported by training grant Al 07033-05 from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. <br><br> The authors gratefully acknowledge the advice, laboratory assistance, and careful review of this manuscript by Dr. Robert C.
