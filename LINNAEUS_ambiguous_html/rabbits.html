Abstract
The relationship between parasite fitness and virulence has been the object of experimental and theoretical studies often with conflicting conclusions. Here, we provide direct experimental evidence that viral fitness and virulence, both measured in the same biological environment provided by host cells in culture, can be two unrelated traits. A biological clone of <span class="yellow">foot-and-mouth disease virus</span> acquired high fitness and virulence (cell killing capacity) upon large population passages in cell culture. However, subsequent plaque-to-plaque transfers resulted in profound fitness loss, but only a minimal decrease of virulence. While fitness-decreasing mutations have been mapped throughout the genome, virulence determinants—studied here with mutant and chimeric viruses—were multigenic, but concentrated on some genomic regions. Therefore, we propose a model in which viral virulence is more robust to mutation than viral fitness. As a consequence, depending on the passage regime, viral fitness and virulence can follow different evolutionary trajectories. This lack of correlation is relevant to current models of attenuation and virulence in that virus de-adaptation need not entail a decrease of virulence.
Virulence expresses the harm that parasites inflict upon their hosts. Many studies have addressed the basis of virulence and its effect on host and parasite survival. It has generally been accepted that one of the components of parasite virulence is fitness, or the capacity of the parasite to multiply in its host. Some models have equated virulence with fitness. In the present study, we use <span class="yellow">foot-and-mouth disease virus</span> (<span class="yellow">FMDV</span>) to document that virulence and fitness—measured in the same biological environment provided by cells in culture—can be unrelated traits. This has been achieved by multiplying the virus in a manner that mutations accumulated in its genome. Mutations decreased fitness dramatically, but not virulence. Chimeric and mutant viruses were constructed to show that virulence is influenced by only some of the <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> genes, while fitness is influenced by the entire genome. For this reason, virulence is more robust (“resistant”) than fitness to the effects of deleterious mutations. The fact that virulence can be unrelated to fitness has implications for the design of anti-viral vaccines because it suggests that it may be possible to design high fitness, low virulence strains to stimulate the host immune response. Furthermore, in modelling studies it cannot be assumed that virulence is equal to fitness.<br><br><br><br>Introduction
The relationship between fitness and virulence is an unsettled question, and sometimes fitness is considered a component of the virulence phenotype of parasites. RNA viruses are ideal systems to address this important question because of their high mutability and fecundity, which result in a potential for rapid evolution, and also because of the availability of quantitative fitness and virulence assays.
RNA viruses replicate as complex and dynamic mutant spectra, termed viral quasispecies. Key to quasispecies dynamics are mutation rates in the range of 10−3 to 10−5 substitutions per nucleotide copied, and competition among continuously arising variant genomes [1–4], which prompt rapid movements in sequence space, with corresponding changes of position in the fitness landscape [5]. Indeed, large population passages of RNA viruses in cell culture permit competitive optimization of mutant distributions that generally result in fitness gain [6,7], while repeated bottleneck events (experimentally realized as plaque-to-plaque transfers) lead to random accumulation of deleterious mutations (operation of Muller's ratchet [8]) and result in average fitness decreases [9–13]. Fitness recovery of low fitness <span class="yellow">foot-and-mouth disease virus</span> (<span class="yellow">FMDV</span>) clones occurs mainly with introduction of mutations along the genome, with very few true reversions.
An understanding of the consequences of fitness variation for viral virulence is a key question for viral pathogenesis and evolution. Here, we approach this issue with <span class="yellow">FMDV</span>, an important viral pathogen in veterinary medicine [14], and one that fully participates of quasispecies dynamics. Our laboratory has characterized multiple <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> variants that derive from one original biological clone, and that occupy widely different fitness levels when replicating in a defined environment in cell culture. We define fitness as the replication capacity of a mutant <span class="yellow">FMDV</span>, relative to a reference <span class="yellow">FMDV</span>, in direct growth-competition upon coinfection of baby <span class="yellow">hamster</span> kidney 21 (BHK-21) cells [15–17]. Fitness of <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> in BHK-21 cells is a multigenic trait [7].
In the present study, we define virulence of <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> as the capacity of the virus to kill BHK-21 cells under a standard set of cell culture conditions [18]. Thus, the <span class="yellow">FMDV</span>–BHK-21 system offered a means to investigate in a direct and comparative fashion the relationship between fitness and virulence of a virus, measured in the same biological environment provided by BHK-21 cells. We describe the behavior of an <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> clone (
				), which has a history of repeated serial plaque-to-plaque transfers in BHK-21 cells [11], that attained a very low fitness value relative to its parental reference virus (C-S8c1), and yet, its virulence for BHK-21 cells was significantly higher than that of C-S8c1. A comparative study of the capacity to kill BHK-21 cells of chimeric <span class="yellow">FMDVs</span> constructed with cDNA copies of the two parental <span class="yellow">FMDVs</span> indicates that the enhanced virulence for BHK-21 cells of the low fitness clone is a polygenic trait, with participation of the regions encoding capsid proteins and non-structural proteins 2A, 2B, and 2C as virulence determinants. Three specific amino acid replacements in 2C have been identified as redundant virulence determinants of <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> for BHK-21 cells. Thus, while large population passages of the virus resulted in a gain of both fitness and virulence, subsequent bottleneck passages resulted in a decrease of fitness but not of virulence.
			
The results suggest that fitness is very vulnerable to mutation in any genomic region. In contrast, because of the involvement of several (but not all) viral genes in virulence, and the redundant effect of three 2C substitutions, virulence is a more robust phenotypic trait than fitness, and less vulnerable to accumulation of mutations. Therefore, we provide direct evidence that viral fitness and capacity to kill cells can (in some cases) be unrelated traits. Furthermore, the relationship between fitness and virulence, of being either linked or unrelated traits, depends on the evolutionary history of the virus. This observation has implications for viral pathogenesis, and sheds light on models of virulence proposed on the basis of theoretical and experimental studies with cellular organisms.<br><br>Results
Inability of <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> 
					 to Establish a Persistent Infection in BHK-21 Cells
				
Several biological clones and populations were obtained by passaging <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> biological clone C-S8c1 [19–22] in BHK-21 cells, either as large population passages or plaque-to-plaque transfers (Figure 1). The biological clones and populations differed up to 236-fold in relative fitness (Table 1). The fitness differences found are expected from previous results on fitness gain upon large population passages of RNA viruses [6,7] and fitness decrease upon plaque-to-plaque (bottleneck) transfers [9–13]. The initial experiment was aimed at testing whether 
					, because of its low fitness (0.11 times that of its parental C-S8c1 [12,23,24] [Table 1]), had an advantage in establishing a persistent non-cytopathic infection in BHK-21 cells as compared with its parental clone, C-S8c1 (Figure 1). A persistent <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> infection is established by growing the cells that survive a standard cytolytic infection with <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> [25]. Confluent monolayers of BHK-21 cells were infected either with C-S8c1 or with 
					 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.02–0.1 plaque-forming units (PFU)/cell (2 × 106 cells infected with 4 × 104 −2 × 105 PFU). Unexpectedly, at 24 h postinfection, the cells infected with 
					 showed extensive cytopathology, and at 48 h postinfection, no surviving cells were observed. The frequency of surviving cells in parallel infections with C-S8c1 was 5 × 10−3–9 × 10−3, which is consistent with previous determinations [25]. No persistently infected BHK-21 cell cultures could be established with 
					, despite several attempts. Thus, C-S8c1, which displays a 9-fold higher relative fitness than 
					 in BHK-21 cells, showed a capacity to kill BHK-21 cells that was at least 103-fold lower than the killing capacity of 
					 in the infectivity assay intended to establish a persistent <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> infection.
				<br><br><span class="yellow">FMDV</span> Fitness and Capacity to Kill BHK-21 Cells May Not Be Positively Correlated
The capacity of 
					 to kill BHK-21 cells despite its low fitness in BHK-21 cells led us to quantitatively examine the relationship between fitness of <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> and its capacity to kill BHK-21 cells. To this aim, <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> clones or populations were compared in a cell killing assay, consisting in determining the time required to kill 104 BHK-21 cells as a function of the PFU added (described in Materials and Methods). The results (Figure 2A) indicate that over the time range of 12 h to 48 h postinfection, the number of PFUs needed to kill 104 BHK-21 cells varied logarithmically as a function of time. Similar quantifications of relative virulence were obtained by measuring the PFU needed to kill 104 cells in 24 h, and then by extrapolating the PFU values to 0 h postinfection (Tables 1 and S1). Virulence of 
					 was 29 to 35 times higher than virulence of C-S8c1, despite the latter displaying a 9-fold higher fitness (Tables 1 and S1). The high virulence of 
					 was not due to the plaque-to-plaque transfers, since a high virulence was also quantitated for its parental clone, 
					, and for population C-S8p113 (Figure 2B; Tables 1, 2, and S1). 
					 deviated from a line that correlated relative fitness of <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> and the logarithm of cell killing capacity, as reflected in the decrease of the regression coefficient (R2) (inset in Figure 2A). Probably, this deviation is due to the fact that 
					 lost fitness due to plaque-to-plaque transfers, and the other viruses were not subjected to plaque-to-plaque transfers. On the other hand, virulence determinants were acquired during the large population passages done between C-S8c1 and C-S8c1p113. The 29- to 35-fold higher virulence of 
					 with respect to C-S8c1 (Tables 1 and S1), despite its low fitness, indicates that viral fitness and virulence can be two unrelated traits.
				<br><br>Mapping Virulence Determinants in the 
					 Genome
				
The comparison of the consensus nucleotide sequence of the 
					 genome with that of C-S8c1 revealed a total of 47 mutations (Table S2), leading to 21 amino acid replacements affecting structural and non-structural proteins (Figure 3). To identify the genomic regions associated with the increased virulence of 
					 with respect to C-S8c1, we measured the BHK-21 cell killing capacity of nine chimeric viruses rescued from constructs obtained by introducing fragments of cDNA of the 
					 genome into plasmid pMT28, which encodes infectious C-S8c1 RNA [21] (Figure 4). The results (Figure 5; Tables 2 and S1) show that several genomic regions contribute to the virulence of 
					 for BHK-21 cells, and that the major contributors map within genomic positions 2046 to 3760 (residues encoding part of VP2, VP3, and part of VP1, Figure 5A) and 3760 to 5839 (residues encoding 2A, 2B, 2C, and 3A, Figure 5B). The results exclude the internal ribosome entry site and the 3C- and 3D-coding regions as significant virulence determinants of 
					 for BHK-21 cells (virulence of the relevant chimeric viruses ≤ 2.5, relative to C-S8c1; Tables 2 and S1). Infectious progeny production by each chimeric virus was intermediate between the production of the parental viruses pMT28 and 
					, with no significant differences that could be correlated with virulence (Table 2).
				<br><br>Non-Structural Protein 2C Is a Determinant of the Virulence of <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> for BHK-21 Cells
Amino acid substitutions in <span class="yellow">human rhinovirus</span> protein 2C promoted cytopathology for <span class="yellow">mouse</span> L cells [26]. Remarkably, 
					 shares with other <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> clones and populations, notably, MARLS and C-S8p260p3d (the two viruses showing the highest virulence for BHK-21 cells; Figure 2A; Tables 1 and S1), three amino acid substitutions in 2C: S80N, T256A, and Q263H. In addition, MARLS and CS8p260p3d include replacement M283V in 2C, relative to C-S8c1 [27,28]. To test whether any (or a combination) of the three shared amino acid substitutions in 2C contributed to the increased virulence of <span class="yellow">FMDV</span>, each of the mutations was introduced individually into plasmid pMT28 by site-directed mutagenesis, as described in Materials and Methods. Transcripts of the three mutants, termed pMT28 (SN), pMT28 (TA), and pMT28 (QH) (Figure 4), were used to transfect BHK-21 cells, and the viruses obtained were tested with the BHK-21 cell killing assay. Viruses having any of the substitutions in 2C have a virulence intermediate between that of C-S8c1 and 
					 (Figure 6A). To test whether the combination of the three substitutions in 2C could produce an additional increase of virulence, the three mutations were introduced in pMT28 to rescue the triple mutant pMT28 (SN, TA, QH) (Figure 4). The results (Figure 6B) show that the virulence of the triple 2C mutant is similar to the virulence of the individual 2C mutants. The 2C mutations did not significantly affect the infectious progeny production (Table 2). A testable prediction of this result is that the introduction of the wild-type 2C-3A-coding region in the genetic background of 
					 should produce a virus with lower virulence than 
					. Indeed, the results with such a chimeric virus (Figure 5D) indicate that the presence of the 2C- and 3A-coding region as the only genetic region of the pMT28 in the genetic background of 
					 resulted in an <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> with a 2.4- to 4.8-fold lower virulence than 
					. We conclude that mutations in 2C contribute to virulence of <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> for BHK-21 cells.
				
Thus, a virus that evolves towards low fitness levels due to the operation of Muller's ratchet may nevertheless maintain its capacity to kill the same cells in which it displays low fitness. In <span class="yellow">FMDV</span>, the enhanced capacity to kill BHK-21 cells was multigenic, including participation of non-structural protein 2C with three amino acid substitutions acting in a redundant fashion. In conclusion, the results provide a molecular interpretation of why fitness and virulence of an animal virus can follow disparate evolutionary trajectories, culminating in two unrelated traits.<br><br>
Discussion
The capacity of a virus to kill cells is probably influenced by several steps in the virus life cycle, including receptor affinity (which may trigger signalling pathways and alter cell functions) and intracellular viral replication that may lead to metabolic alterations such as transcriptional or translational shut-off [29]. A parallel increase of virulence and fitness as a virus improves its adaptation to a host cell type is expected, since a key parameter that should contribute to the fitness level of a cytophatic virus is the accumulation of infectious particles and its release from cells, which are events often associated with cell killing. This expectation was fulfilled in our experiments (increase of both fitness and cell killing following large population passages of C-S8c1 [Figure 2]), and also in other virus–host systems. In a comparison of two genetically divergent isolates of the whispovirus white spot syndrome virus, whose virulence for the <span class="yellow">shrimp</span> host <span class="yellow">Penaeus monodon</span> was measured by in vivo cumulative mortality rates, virulence correlated with competitive fitness in vivo [30]. The onset of type 1 diabetes by coxsackievirus B strains was linked to the viral replication rate and to the infectious dose [31]. In engineered alphavirus replicons, a direct correlation between the level of RNA replication and cytopathogenicity was observed [32]. At an epidemiological level, a greater replicative fitness of historical versus current <span class="yellow">human immunodeficiency virus type 1</span> (<span class="yellow">HIV-1</span>) isolates was taken as evidence of <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span> attenuation over time, assuming a direct connection between fitness and virulence [33]. In vivo, viral fitness may vary among specific organs, and virulence may be affected only when fitness for some specific target tissues is affected [34].
Replicative fitness is, however, but one of several factors which influence the progression of a viral infection in vivo. In a comparative analysis, R5-tropic and X4-tropic clones of <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span> showed similar replication capacity in mitogen-activated T cells. However, X4 clones were transferred more efficiently than R5 clones from dendritic cells to CD4(+) T cells, a fact that can contribute to the competitive advantage of X4 viruses in AIDS <span class="yellow">patients</span> [35]. <span class="yellow">Simian immunodeficiency virus</span> <span class="yellow">SIVmac239</span> infects both the <span class="yellow">sooty mangabey</span> and the <span class="yellow">rhesus macaque</span>, reaching high viral loads in both hosts, yet it is only virulent for the <span class="yellow">rhesus macaque</span> [36]. Deviations of a positive correlation between viral fitness and virulence were observed also in the plant viruses <span class="yellow">cucumber mosaic virus</span> [37] and <span class="yellow">barley stripe mosaic virus</span> [38]. A study of the effect of lysis timing on <span class="yellow">bacteriophage</span> fitness revealed that a strain with an intermediate lysis time had the highest fitness [39]. The time of transmission may also affect virulence. Nuclear polyhedrosis virus transmitted early to its host, the <span class="yellow">moth</span> <span class="yellow">Lymantria dispar</span>, was more virulent than virus transmitted late, although the latter was more productive because the virus could use more host tissue for replication [40]. In a study of the susceptibility of North American and non–North American breeds of Lymantria to several isolates of the fungus <span class="yellow">Entomaphaga maimaiga</span>, mortality was scored in all cases. However, virulence of the fungus, quantitated by the time of death of Lymantria, was, in some cases, inversely proportional to fitness, quantitated by fungal reproduction in the <span class="yellow">moth</span> [41]. In all these cases, the molecular basis of the lack of positive correlation between fitness and virulence is not understood.
Model for a Lack of Correlation between Viral Fitness and Virulence
The results with <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> clones H5 have documented that both fitness-enhancing and virulence-enhancing mutations can be incorporated in the viral genome in such a fashion that subsequent fitness-decreasing mutations associated with bottleneck (plaque-to-plaque) transfers produce only minimal effects on virulence (Figure 2). The dissection of accompanying molecular events, achieved through quantification of virulence of recombinant and mutant genomes (Tables 2 and S1), provides an interpretation of the lack of positive correlation between virulence and fitness. Multiple fitness-decreasing mutations occur in the course of plaque-to-plaque transfers, distributed throughout the <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> genome [11]. In contrast, determinants of virulence for BHK-21 cells are multigenic, but concentrated mainly in some <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> genomic regions. Similar multigenic but discrete virulence determinants have been described also in other virus–host systems [42,43]. To decrease virulence, mutations occurring randomly in the course of plaque-to-plaque transfers should affect specific genomic sites, and this will occur with a lower probability than fitness-decreasing mutations, which can hit any of the multifunctional picornaviral proteins and regulatory regions [11]. This model is reinforced by the observation that three amino acid substitutions in 2C (S80N, T256A, and Q263H) had a similar effect in enhancing <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> virulence, and the three mutations in the same genome had an effect comparable to each mutation individually (Figure 6; Tables 2 and S1). It is not clear what the basis of the contribution of 2C to virulence for BHK-21 could be. 2C is involved in RNA synthesis and contains a nucleotide-binding domain, although none of the substitutions found in 
					 and 
					 lie within such a domain. An unlikely triple reversion would be required to eliminate the virulence-enhancing effect of the three mutations in 2C. We propose that a higher robustness of the <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> genome with regard to virulence for BHK-21 cells, rather than to replicative fitness in the same cells, underlies the different trajectories followed by fitness and virulence upon subjecting the virus to repeated bottleneck transfers. Obviously, we cannot exclude that parameters of the virus life cycle, other than fitness as measured in our experiments, could correlate with virulence for BHK-21.
				
The comparative analysis of <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> clones and populations shows that shifts in virulence can occur even through the evolution of a single viral clone (C-S8c1), with its restricted genetic diversity prompted by different replication regimes in the same host cells, which also have a clonal origin (see Materials and Methods). We conjecture that the demonstration that fitness and virulence can follow different evolutionary courses has been possible thanks to the consequences of the extreme passage regimes to which the viral populations were subjected: competitive evolution of an ample mutant spectra during repeated large population passages, and accumulation of deleterious (with regard to fitness, but not with regard to virulence) mutations upon plaque-to-plaque transfers (predominance of genetic drift and operation of Muller's ratchet) [12,15].<br><br>Implications for Models of Virulence
It must be emphasized that fitness and virulence are relative values that pertain to a defined physical and biological environment. Virulence determinants of <span class="yellow">FMDV</span>, identified here for BHK-21 cells, need not apply to virulence for the natural animal hosts of <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> [44]. However, the observation of a lack of correlation between fitness and virulence in a <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> clone is relevant to current models of attenuation and virulence, since it shows that more virulent forms of a virus need not have a reproductive advantage, and that viral virulence is not necessarily a byproduct of viral fitness. Even if virulence is regarded as an unavoidable consequence of parasite adaptation [45], virus de-adaptation (fitness loss) need not entail a decrease of virulence.
Most current definitions of virulence include both the ability of the pathogen to multiply and to cause harm to its host; some authors, however, assume a direct relationship between fitness and capacity to produce disease [46–48]. In relating the results with <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> to general models of virulence in host–parasite systems, it must be considered that in the <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> system, evolution of the host BHK-21 cells could not influence <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> evolution, because clonal cell populations with a controlled passage history were supplied in constant numbers at each infection event (see Materials and Methods). Therefore, changes in host density, or mobility, as well as pathogen survival in the external environment, all of which are relevant parameters in virulence models [48,49], cannot play a role in our system. A consistent finding in serial passage experiments is that virulence of a parasite increases with passage number in a new host [50]. The results with <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> infecting BHK-21 cells cytolytically imply that the increase of virulence can be conditioned to the history of passage regimes undergone by a virus.
The invariance of BHK-21 cells in the course of serial cytolytic passages of <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> is in contrast with the parallel system consisting of BHK-21 cells persistently infected with <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> C-S8c1 [25], in which the cells are passaged and coevolve with the resident virus [51]. Host–virus coevolution has generally favored a decrease of viral virulence in the field, a classical example being <span class="yellow">myxoma virus</span> and myxomatosis in <span class="blue">rabbits</span> [52].
Our comparison of <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> clones did not provide evidence of clones with high fitness and low virulence, which, with regard to natural hosts, is an aim of biomedicine to obtain vaccine strains. Yet, the existence of specific mutations that differentially affect fitness and virulence opens the way to engineer candidate vaccine strains unable to kill the host, while maintaining replicative competence. Virulence is, however, a feature of the host–parasite relationship [46], and the mutations needed to impair virulence are expected to be host-dependent [53,54].<br><br>
Materials and Methods
Cells, viruses, and infections.
The BHK-21 cells used in the present study were cloned by end-point dilution, followed by preparation of a cell stock from a single cell; they were passaged a maximum of 30 times before being used for <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> infection [25,51]. Procedures for cell growth, infection of BHK-21 cell monolayers with <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> in liquid medium, and plaque assays in semi-solid agar medium were carried out as previously described [11,19,25,27]. Mock-infected cells were handled in parallel in all infectivity and plaque assays to monitor absence of viral contamination. The <span class="yellow">FMDVs</span> used in the present study (Figure 1) are (i) the reference clone C-S8c1, which has been assigned a relative fitness of 1.0 [11]. (ii) MARLS, a monoclonal antibody escape mutant isolated from population C-S8c1p213 [55]; MARLS has a fitness of 25 relative to C-S8c1 [24]. (iii) C-S8p260p3d, a standard <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> virus rescued by low MOI passage of C-S8p260. The latter is a virus that evolved by passage of C-S8c1 at a high MOI, which resulted in dominance of two defective <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> genomes (both including internal deletions) that were infectious by complementation, in the absence of standard virus [22,24,28]; C-S8p260p3d has a relative fitness of 20 [24]. (iv) REDpt60, obtained after 60 successive plaque-to-plaque transfers of RED (a monoclonal antibody escape mutant isolated from population C-S8c1p100) [20]; REDpt60 has a fitness of 1.9 relative to C-S8c1. (v) C-S8c1p113, a viral population obtained after 113 serial cytolytic passages of C-S8c1 at a high MOI in BHK-21 cells (2 × 106 BHK-21 cells infected with the virus contained in 200 μl of the supernatant from the previous infection). (vi) Clone 
					, a biological clone isolated from population C-S8c1p113 [11]; its relative fitness is 26 (unpublished data). (vii) Clone 
					, obtained after 95 successive plaque-to-plaque transfers of 
					 [11]; its relative fitness is 0.11 [23].
				<br><br>Cell killing assay.
The capacity of <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> to kill BHK-21 cells was measured as previously described [18,22]. The assay consists in determining the minimum number of PFU required to kill 104 BHK-21 cells after variable times of infection. The assay was performed in M96 multiwell plates with monolayers of 104 BHK-21 cells per well infected with serial dilutions of virus. At different times postinfection, cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde and stained with 2% crystal violet in 2% formaldehyde. Results are expressed as the logarithm of the number of PFUs needed for complete cell killing (as judged by cell staining with crystal violet, with series of control wells with known numbers of cells) as a function of time postinfection [18,22].<br><br>Determination of relative fitness of 
					.
				
The relative fitness of <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> 
					 was determined by growth competition in BHK-21 cells as previously described [7,10,11,24,56]. <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> 
					 was mixed with appropriate proportions of 
					, which was used as reference virus. This virus has a fitness 8.5-fold higher than that of the reference clone of C-S8c1 in BHK-21 cells [7,10,11,24,56]. Four serial infections were carried out at MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell. The proportion of the two competing genomes at different passages was determined by real-time reverse transcription (RT)–PCR, employing primers 5531wtnew and 
					, which are able to discriminate <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> 
					 RNA from 
					 RNA. The nucleotide sequences of the primers will be provided upon request. The fitness vector obtained for 
					 corresponded to the equation y = 0,0206e1,1074x; R2 = 0.9507. The antilogarithm (base e) of the vector slope is the fitness of the assayed virus relative to the reference virus [56].
				<br><br>cDNA synthesis, molecular cloning, and nucleotide sequencing.
Viral RNA was extracted by treatment with Trizol as previously described [57]. Reverse transcription of <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> RNA was carried out with <span class="yellow">avian myeloblastosis virus</span> reverse transcriptase (Promega, http://www.promega.com) or Transcriptor reverse transcriptase (Roche, http://www.roche.com), and PCR amplification was performed by using either Ampli-Taq polymerase (PerkinElmer, http://las.perkinelmer.com) or an Expand High Fidelity polymerase system (Roche), as instructed by the manufacturers. The <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> genome-specific oligonucleotide primers used have been previously described [22,58]. In all RT-PCR amplifications, negative amplification controls, including all reaction components except template RNA, were run in parallel to monitor absence of contamination.
Chimeric viruses containing selected regions of 
					 in the genetic background of C-S8c1 (Figure 4) were obtained by replacing the corresponding DNA fragment of pMT28 by a cDNA copy of 
					 RNA, using specific restriction sites. To obtain pMT28/
					 (436-2046), a chimera that included nucleotides 436 to 2046 of 
					 (the residue numbering of the <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> genome is as in [11]),

Abstract
The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is separated from the photoreceptor outer segments by the subretinal space. While the actual volume of this space is minimal, the communication that occurs across this microenvironment is important to the visual process, and accumulating evidence suggests the purines ATP and adenosine contribute to this communication. P1 and P2 receptors are localized to membranes on both the photoreceptor outer segments and on the apical membrane of the RPE which border subretinal space. ATP is released across the apical membrane of the RPE into this space in response to various triggers including glutamate and chemical ischemia. This ATP is dephosphorylated into adenosine by a series of ectoenzymes on the RPE apical membrane. Regulation of release and ectoenzyme activity in response to light-sensitive signals can alter the balance of purines in subretinal space, and thus coordinate communication across subretinal space with the visual process.<br><br>Introduction
The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) lies between the outer segments of the photoreceptors and the choroidal blood supply (Fig. 1). The RPE combines the functions of epithelial and glial cells, providing a barrier while also supporting the neural photoreceptors and modulating their function. Tight communication between photoreceptors and the RPE is critical to coordinate the multiple levels of interaction, and the purinergic contribution to this communication is becoming apparent. The relevance of this purinergic input is emphasized by the many functional effects of P1 and P2 receptor stimulation and by the multiple mechanisms in place to regulate subretinal levels of purine agonists. As the dynamics of ATP release and extracellular conversion into adenosine will modify agonist availability, the modulation of these processes can exert a temporal control on purinergic signaling. The following review will outline the main interactions between the RPE and photoreceptors, describe the effects of stimulating purinergic receptors on both sides of subretinal space, and summarize how levels of ATP, ADP, and adenosine are manipulated in this microenvironment.
Fig. 1Schematic illustration of the key components of purinergic signaling in the subretinal microenvironment. Stimulation of P2 receptors on the RPE can enhance transepithelial fluid absorption while P1 receptors can modulate phagocytosis. ATP released through CFTR and other Cl− channels can stimulate P2 receptors or be converted to ADP, AMP, and adenosine (Ado) by a series of ectonucleotidases present on the apical membrane of the RPE. By controlling the balance of extracellular purines available to stimulate these receptors these mechanisms can control levels of endogenous purines available to activate the receptors. While theoretically possible, it remains to be determined whether these subretinal purines can actually stimulate photoreceptors
Purines and subretinal space
RPE-photoreceptor interactions across the subretinal space
The outer segments of the rods and cones are responsible for the initial stages of vision, converting photon energy into a series of enzymatic reactions that close the light-sensitive channels on the photoreceptor plasma membrane, hyperpolarize the cells, and reduce the release of glutamate from the synaptic terminals [1, 2]. Efficient photoreceptor function depends upon both short-term and long-term support from the RPE. The critical nature of these interactions is evident from the rapid degeneration of photoreceptors in the absence of a healthy RPE layer and by the RPE localization of defective gene product in some forms of hereditary photoreceptor degeneration [3].
The apical membrane of the RPE is separated from the plasma membrane of the outer segments by an extracellular space of only 10–20 nm [4]. Although small, this subretinal space contains a highly structured matrix which ensheathes the outer segments and extends to the RPE [5, 6]. The presence of enzymes within this interphotoreceptor matrix emphasizes that this extracellular space itself is functionally active [7, 8]. This intimate anatomical relationship between photoreceptors and the RPE reflects multiple functional interactions. For example, the RPE accepts, recycles, and exports central components of the phototransduction process [9]. The outer segments are continuously resynthesized, and the phagocytosis, degradation, and processing of shed outer segment tips by the RPE cells is central to this renewal [10]. The ion channels and transporters on the apical membrane of the RPE help regulate the ionic composition of the subretinal space [11]. As extracellular levels of ions can modify the ionic driving forces across the photoreceptor plasma membrane, these RPE transporters can influence the state of neural activity. The transport of fluid and ions from the apical membrane to basolateral membrane of the RPE is also one of the main forces keeping the retina attached [12].
The control of photoreceptor activity by light gives a rapid temporal dependence to some interactions between the photoreceptors and the RPE. The volume of subretinal space increases in response to light [13], linking small changes in the ionic composition of the subretinal space with activity of the RPE transport mechanisms which maintain this volume [14, 15]. Other processes are controlled on a diurnal cycle. The shed tips of the outer segments are phagocytosed by the RPE soon after the onset of light [16, 17]. These processes can both be modulated by purine levels in subretinal space, indicating purinergic regulation is important over multiple time scales.<br><br>Purinergic receptors on photoreceptors
A2 adenosine receptors were localized to both the inner and outer segments of photoreceptor outer segments over a decade ago by Blazynski and colleagues [18], with more recent reports emphasizing their functional role. A2 agonists inhibit the L-type Ca2+ channel on rod outer segments [19] and can inhibit the synaptic release of glutamate from rods, suggesting changes in adenosine levels in subretinal space could modulate light sensitivity [20]. The A2 agonist DPMA and the adenosine deaminase inhibitor EHNA reduce mRNA for opsin in rods, suggesting that endogenous levels of adenosine can downregulate opsin message at night [21]. EHNA and the A2A receptor agonist CGS21680 also increase the survival of <span class="yellow">chick</span> embryonic photoreceptors in culture [22], indicating a long-term neuroprotective role for adenosine.
P2 receptors are also present in the photoreceptors. mRNA for the P2X2 receptor is expressed in the photoreceptor cell bodies, with immunohistochemical localization of the protein to outer segments [23]. In situ hybridization indicates the photoreceptor layer has the highest level of P2Y2 receptor of any region in the <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> retina, although staining was not pronounced in monkey [24]. P2X7 receptors have recently been localized to photoreceptor synaptic terminals, with evidence for ecto-ATPase activity in the synapse, and functional evidence suggesting ATP augments transmission of the light response by rods [25]. It was suggested that ATP might be co-released from photoreceptors with glutamate, although this remains to be tested directly.<br><br>Purinergic receptors on the RPE
Stimulation of P1 receptors can have a considerable impact on RPE cells. A2 receptors have been recognized on cultured and fresh RPE cells for some time [26, 27], with in situ hybridization confirming the presence of A2A receptors in <span class="yellow">rat</span> RPE [28]. Stimulation of A2 receptors reduces the rate of rod outer segment phagocytosis by RPE cells [29], while application of adenosine to the apical membrane of <span class="yellow">chick</span> RPE cells increases the basolateral Cl- conductance, the transepithelial potential, and the c-wave, and decreases the hyperpolarization of the basal membrane in response to light [30]. Although adenosine alone does not increase intracellular Ca2+ levels [31], adenosine acts synergistically with ATP to elevate Ca2+ levels in <span class="yellow">human</span> RPE cells by stimulating both A1 and A2A receptors [32, 33]. Stimulation of A1 receptors with high doses of NECA increases the active transport of fluorescein across the RPE, while activation of A2A receptors decreases this transport, and by extension, transport of the ions that underlie fluid movement [34]. Stimulation of A1 and A2A receptors produces analogous increases and decreases, respectively, in the absorption of subretinal fluid blebs. This is consistent with the negative coupling of the A1 receptor and the positive coupling of the A2 receptors to adenylate cyclase, as increasing cAMP inhibits the transport of fluid across the RPE towards the choroid [35–37]. The agonist 2-Cl adenosine reverses the deficit in phosphoinositide metabolism found in diabetic RPE cells [38], suggesting effects on metabolism in addition to transport and phagocytosis.
Multiple P2 receptors have been localized to the RPE. The P2Y2 receptor was initially characterized in cultured <span class="yellow">human</span> RPE [31], with subsequent reports localizing transcript for P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, and P2Y6 in the <span class="yellow">rat</span> RPE/choroid [39] and for P2Y1 and P2Y12 receptors in ARPE-19 cells [40], and functionally identifying a P2X receptor in <span class="yellow">rat</span> RPE cells [41]. ATP, ADP, and UTP induce numerous effects on RPE physiology [32, 33, 42, 43]. While these effects likely involve multiple different receptor types, the contributions of the P2Y2 receptor have been explored in most detail to date. The P2Y2 receptor has been specifically localized to the apical membrane of fresh <span class="yellow">bovine</span> RPE cells, and addition of ATP to this membrane transiently elevates Ca2+, activates a basolateral Cl- conductance, inhibits an apical K+ conductance, and increases the apical to basolateral flow of fluid [43]. This increased absorption of fluid from the subretinal space suggests P2Y2 receptor stimulation could reduce the excess fluid that accumulates in retinal edemas, and several reports have supported this theory. ATP, UTP, and the P2Y2 receptor agonist INS37217 decrease the size of subretinal fluid blebs when injected into subretinal space of <span class="yellow">rats</span> [44]. In both normal and rds +/- <span class="yellow">mice</span> with experimentally induced detachment, INS31217 improves the ERG recovery and decreased cell death [45]. INS37217 also reduces subretinal blebs in <span class="blue">rabbits</span> [46]. Injection of another P2Y2 agonist, INS542, increases the active transport of fluorescein across the RPE, consistent with this upregulation of ion and fluid transport across the tissue [47]. Together these experiments emphasize the clinical potential of treating retinal edema with P2Y2 agonists.<br><br>
Regulation of purine levels in subretinal space
While synthesized purinergic agonists may prove useful in treating some ocular disorders, the endogenous activation of P1 and P2 receptors in the subretinal microenvironment will ultimately be determined by availability of agonists. These levels are largely controlled by the release of ATP into the subretinal space, its conversion into other purines including adenosine, and the manipulation of adenosine by enzymes or transporters. Recent work has increased our understanding of both the stimuli that initiate changes in subretinal purine levels and the mechanisms that mediate these changes.
Release of ATP by the RPE
At least some of the ATP capable of stimulating the purinergic receptors on RPE cells is released from the RPE itself. The resulting autocrine stimulation ensures local delivery, and control, of purines to initiate the physiologic changes in the RPE. The release of ATP by RPE cells is triggered by multiple stimuli including osmotic stress, bFGF, UTP, NMDA, glutamate, and ATP [39, 40, 48–51]. The ATP release following activation of NMDA receptors by glutamate may have the most interesting implications for communication across subretinal space, given that glutamate confers the light signal from photoreceptors to the rest of the visual system. Glutamate and the specific receptor agonist NMDA triggers ATP release from ARPE-19 cells, with the release inhibited by NMDA antagonist MK-801, and by DCKA, which inhibits the glycine B binding site on NMDA receptors [51, 52]. Although NMDA raises intracellular Ca2+ levels, this increase is prevented by eliminating ATP with apyrase, indicating autostimulation through released ATP is responsible for this Ca2+ signal. NMDA also triggers a release of ATP when applied to the intact <span class="yellow">bovine</span> RPE eyecup [51]. The NMDA receptors and the ATP release sites have been functionally identified to the apical membrane of the <span class="yellow">bovine</span> RPE, suggesting the neurotransmitter interactions could amplify the signal from any glutamate reaching subretinal space.
The ability of both UTP and ATP to stimulate release of ATP from the RPE supports the theory that the system acts to amplify signals. When applied at greater than 1 μM, ATP triggers a secondary release of ATP peaking 10 min after the initial stimuli [40]. UTP also initiates a release in extracellular ATP with a similar delay [48]. The rise in ATP triggered by UTP is inhibited by the Cl- channel blocker NPPB, and UDP is much less effective at triggering release than UTP; both observations suggest the P2Y2 receptor contributes to the increase in ATP more than diphosphokinase, although influence from the enzyme cannot be ruled out [53].
Recent evidence suggests that ischemia may lead to the release of ATP from RPE cells. Chemical ischemia triggers a substantial ATP release from cardiac myocytes [54], while changes in oxygen levels trigger ATP release in central chemoreceptors [55]. We found that exposure to sodium cyanide led to a rapid release of ATP from ARPE-19 cells (Fig. 2). As hypoxic and/or ischemic challenge may lead to changes in the expression of growth factors in RPE cells during certain ocular disorders such as macular degeneration [56], and as purines can induce expression of VEGF in other cells [57], this ATP release may contribute to growth factor signaling by the diseased RPE.
Fig. 2Chemical ischemia triggers ATP release from ARPE-19 cells. ATP release was measured in the bath directly from cells plated in 96-well plates to which the luciferin- luciferase reaction mixture was added [51]. Left Levels of ATP in the bath after addition of 5 mM NaCN to the cells. Measurement began 1 min after addition of NaCN or control solution to wells. Right Levels of ATP measured at the peak, 3 min after addition of NaCN (n = 12). Levels were normalized to concurrent levels in control (n = 14). Symbols and bars represent mean ± SE, *p < 0.001
The particular conduit for ATP release varies with the stimuli. The release in response to hypotonic challenge is largely dependent upon CFTR, as it was prevented by the specific CFTR inhibitor CFTR172 in addition to the more general blocker glybenclamide [50]. While the precise mechanisms by which CFTR contributes to this release are not yet known, a role for CFTR in ATP release into subretinal space is consistent with the reduction of certain ERG components in cftr -/- <span class="yellow">mice</span> [58] and with the ability of apical ATP to activate conductances associated with these ERG components [43]. The release of ATP is also largely blocked by the vesicular transport inhibitor brefeldin A, suggesting the two processes occurred in series whereby ATP efflux follows the insertion of vesicles containing CFTR into the plasma membrane. Although the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA blocks this ATP release [50], raising Ca2+ alone with ionophore ionomycin does not itself initiate release [48]. This necessary but not sufficient contribution of Ca2+ also supports a role for vesicular insertion.
In contrast to the release following hypotonic challenge, the ATP release in response to NMDA does not involve CFTR [51]. Release is blocked by NPPB, however, suggesting another type of anion channel could serve as a conduit for ATP release. The presence of parallel mechanisms coexisting on the same cell for ATP release triggered by either agonists or by cell swelling has also been reported in astrocytes [59] and may reflect the multiple roles of purinergic signaling within a given tissue. As both stimuli lead to release across the apical membrane into subretinal space, both are expected to influence signaling in the microenvironment.<br><br>Interconversion of purines in subretinal space
The interconversion of nucleotides and nucleosides each capable of stimulating distinct receptors makes the purinergic signaling system of particular interest in a confined region such as the subretinal space. The main enzymes responsible for dephosphorylating extracellular ATP on the RPE cells have been analyzed and a basic understanding of their regulation has begun. This section first describes the enzymes that act on ATP and ADP, followed by enzymes which convert AMP into adenosine.
The dephosphorylation of extracellular ATP by RPE cells involves enzymes from multiple families [40], as found in airway epithelial cells [60]. Degradation of ATP by the apical membrane of the fresh <span class="yellow">bovine</span> eyecup and by ARPE-19 cells is inhibited by ARL67156 or βγmATP. Message for eNPP1, eNPP2, and eNPP3 is present in ARPE-19 cells, consistent with the preference of βγmATP for members of the eNPP family [61]. The cells also express NTPDase2, and NTPDase3, although the intermittent presence of NTPDase1 likely reflects a regulated process [40]. Ecto-alkaline phosphatase has no effect on ATP degradation in RPE cells, in contrast to its considerable contribution in airway epithelium [62]. The putative contribution from diphosphokinases to interconversion of subretinal purines is presently unknown.
Extracellular AMP is rapidly dephosphorylated into adenosine in subretinal space. The production of adenosine from ATP at the apical membrane of the <span class="yellow">bovine</span> RPE eyecup is inhibited by the ecto-5′-nucleotidase inhibitor αβmADP, confirming a role for this enzyme [63]. The enzyme is localized to <span class="yellow">rat</span> RPE and ARPE-19 cells immunohistochemically. Degradation of 5′AMP is highest near the subretinal space of <span class="yellow">rat</span> retina [63], although localization in <span class="yellow">mouse</span> indicated larger amounts of ecto-5′-nucleotidase at the tips of adjacent Müller cells [64]. Levamisole does not inhibit the dephosphorylation of 5′AMP by the RPE, consistent with the absence of substantial ecto-alkaline phosphatase in subretinal space.
The presence of light may alter the levels of adenosine in subretinal space. Epinephrine is released at the onset of light [65] and stimulation of the RPE with epinephrine can decrease activity of ecto-5′-nucleotidase [63]. While norepinephrine and phenylephrine lead to similar decreases in enzyme activity, prazosin and corynanthine block the effects of norepinephrine, implicating the α1 epinephrine receptor in the inhibition of ecto-5′-nucleotidase [63]. The kinetics of inhibition are consistent with cleavage of the nucleotidase from its GPI anchor. The phagocytosis of rod outer segments is maximal shortly after light onset [16], and this phagocytosis is inhibited by adenosine [29]. The ability of epinephrine released by the illuminated retina to reduce ecto-5′-nucleotidase activity and consequently adenosine levels may relieve this inhibition and enhance the rate of phagocytosis at light onset.<br><br>
Physiologic effects of subretinal purines on the RPE and photoreceptors
The number of purinergic receptors on both photoreceptor and RPE membranes suggests purines make multiple contributions to the physiology of the outer retina. Our increased understanding of how agonist levels in subretinal space are controlled has begun to indicate how and when this contribution may occur. Future research will involve applying these findings from isolated systems to intact RPE-photoreceptor models, and pursuing the role of defective purinergic regulation in ocular disease. While it is unlikely that ATP released across the apical membrane of the RPE can diffuse to these P2 receptors in the outer plexiform layer given the ecto-ATPase activity in the synaptic clef [25], stimulation of receptors elsewhere on the photoreceptor membrane is possible. It would be interesting to determine whether ATP released from the RPE and converted to adenosine by ecto-nucleotidases can actually modulate the response to light by stimulating the A2A receptors on photoreceptor outer segments. The impact of purinergic signaling on chronic ocular diseases is also of interest, such as the role of ischemia-driven ATP release in VEGF production. While the small size of subretinal space can complicate pharmacologic manipulation within the intact RPE-photoreceptor complex, molecular approaches may provide new insight into how endogenous purines in subretinal space affect the physiology, and pathophysiology, of both RPE and photoreceptors.<br><br><br><br><h3>pmcA2365090</h3>Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors.

Here we report the synthesis of a heterocyclic sulfonamide CA inhibitor and of the metal complexes containing main group metal ions, such as Be(II), Mg(II), AI(III), Zn(II), Cd(II) and Hg(II) and the new sulfonamide as well as 5-amino-l,3,4thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide as ligands.

Some of them (but not the parent sulfonamides) strongly lowered IOP in <span class="blue">rabbits</span> when administered as a 2% solution into the eye. Introduction Sulfonamides possessing carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) inhibitory properties [2] such as acetazolamide 1, methazolamide 2, ethoxzolamide 3 and dichlorophenamide 4 have been used for more than 40 years as pressure lowering systemic drugs in the treatment of open-angle glaucoma [3,4]. Their effect is due to inhibition of at least two CA isozymes present within cilliary processes of the eye, ie, CA II and CA IV, which is followed by lowered bicarbonate formation and reduction of aqueous humor secretion [5-7]. Their main drawback is constituted by side effects such as fatigue, augmented diuresis, or paresthesias, due to CA inhibition in other tissues/organs than the target one, ie, the eye [8]. <br><br> N--N <br><br> XN--N EtO S <br><br> NH 2 <br><br> O <br><br> NH O:S----O <br><br> NHEt <br><br> The above-mentioned side effects are absent in the case in which the inhibitor has topical activity, and is applied directly into the eye. This route has been demonstrated only in 1983 by Maren's group [9] and was followed by the development of the first clinical agent of this type, dorzolamide 5 [10,11 ]. Dorzolamide (Trusopt) has been introduced in clinical use in 1995 in USA and Europe and it constituted the beginning of a radically new treatment of glaucoma, devoid of the severe side effects observed with the systemic inhibitors [4-6]. The success of topical antiglaucoma CA inhibitors fostered much research in the synthesis and clinical evaluation of other types of such compounds [12-15]. 307 <br><br> Vol. 4, No. 6, 1997 <br><br> Metal Complexes of Heterocyclic Sulfonamides: A New Class ofAntiglaucoma Agents <br><br> On the other hand, metal complexes of heterocyclic sulfonamides of type 1-5 have been recently prepared by two groups 16-20], and it was proved that they possess much stronger CA inhibitory properties than the sulfonamides from which they were prepared 18-22]. Although the mechanism of CA inhibition of the metal complexes is presently unknown, it was hypothesized that their increased inhibitory power might be due to two processes, occurring separately or in concert, ie, (i) dissociation of the complex inhibitor in sulfonamide anions and metal ions (in diluted solution), which in turn both interact thereafter with the enzyme, at different binding sites, and (ii) direct interaction of the undissociated complex with the enzyme, and more specifically with the hydrophilic patch at the entrance of CA II active site [23], this being the isozyme most susceptible to inhibition with this class of compounds [2,22]. Whether initially the first mechanism of action mentioned above was favored by us [22], recent evidences suggested that the undissociated complex might be the inhibitory species, at least for some isozymes [24]. Since metal complexes are much more inhibitory than the parent sulfonamide from which they were prepared, it appeared of interest to test whether this property might be useful for their use in lowering IOP in experimental animals and whence as a possible glaucoma therapy. Recently we proved [25, 26] that some metal complexes of heterocyclic sulfonamides (which themselves do not possess IOP lowering properties) act as very powerful such agents when administered as diluted solutions directly into the eye of experimental animals, and would thus offer the possibility of developing such totally novel drugs. Here we report the synthesis of a heterocyclic sulfonamide possessing strong CA inhibitory properties, ie, 5-(chloroacetamido)-l,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide, and of the metal complexes of this sulfonamide and of 5-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide, containing some main group metal ions. The new compounds have been characterized by standard physico-chemical procedures, and were assayed as inhibitors of three CA isozymes, hCA I, hCA II and bCA IV (h <span class="yellow">human</span>; b <span class="yellow">bovine</span>; these are the isozymes considered to play a critical role in aqueous humour secretion within the eye of higher vertebrates [2-5]). Materials and Methods <br><br> Melting points were recorded with a heating plate microscope and are not corrected. IR spectra were recorded in KBr pellets with a Carl Zeiss IR-80 instrument. 1H-NMR spectra were recorded in DMSO-d6 as solvent, with a Bruker CPX200 instrument. Chemical shifts are reported as values, relative to Me4Si as internal standard. Conductimetric measurements were done at room temperature (1 mM concentration of complex) in DMSO solution with a Fisher conductimeter. Elemental analyses were done by combustion for C, H, N with an automated Carlo Erba analyzer, and gravimetrically for the metal ions, and were 0.4% of the theoretical values. Thermogravimetric measurements were done in air, at a heating rate of 10C/min., with a Perkin Elmer 3600 thermobalance. Sulfonamides used as standards in the enzymatic assay (except for 5), acetazolamide, pyridine, and chloroacetyl chloride used for the preparation of compound 7, solvents as well as inorganic reagents were from Sigma, Merck and Carlo Erba. 5-Amino-l,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide 6 was prepared from acetazolamide by literature procedures [27], by desacetylation with concentrated hydrochloric acid, followed by neutralization with sodium bicarbonate of the corresponding hydrochloride (Scheme 1). Dorzolamide hydrochloride 5 was from Merck, Sharp and Dohme or was prepared as described by Ponticello et al 10,11 ]. <span class="yellow">Human</span> CA and CA II cDNAs were expressed in <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span> strain BL21 (DE3) from the plasmids pACA/hCA I and pACAdaCA II described by Forsman et al. [28] (the two plasmids were a gift from Prof. Sven Lindskog, Umea University, Sweden). Cell growth conditions were those described by Lindskog's group [29], and enzymes were purified by affinity chromatography according to the method of Khalifah et al [30]. Enzyme concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm, utilizing a molar absorptivity of 49 mM-l.cm-1 for hCA and 54 mM-l.cm-1 for hCA II, respectively, based on M 28.85 kDa for hCA I, and 29.3 kDa for hCA II, respectively [31,32]. bCA IV was isolated from <span class="yellow">bovine</span> lung microsomes as described by Maren et al, and its concentration has been determined by titration with ethoxzolamide [33]. Synthesis of 5-(chloroacetamido)- l, 3, 4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide 7 An amount of 1.80 g (10 mmol) of 5-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide 6 was suspended in 20 mL of anhydrous acetonitrile and 0.9 mL (0.87g, 11 mmol) of pyridine added. The mixture was magnetically stirred at 4 C for 10 minutes, then 10.5 mmol of monochloroacetyl chloride, dissolved in 3 mL acetonitrile, were added dropwise for 5 min, and stirring was continued for other 2 hours at room temperature. After an additional 30 min of refluxation, followed by cooling, the precipitated crystals were filtered and recrystallized from ethanol.

To this 308 <br><br> Claudiu T. Supuran et al. <br><br> Metal-Based Drugs <br><br> solution was added the aqueous metal salt (Zn(II), Mg(II), AI(III), Cd(II) chlorides, and Be(II), Pb(II) and Hg(II) nitrate) solution, working in molar ratios RSOzNH- Mn+ of 2:1 for the divalent cations and 3:1 for the trivalent cation, respectively. The aqueous-alcoholic reaction mixture was heated on a steam bath for one hour, adjusting the pH at 7 if necessary, and after being cooled at 0 C the precipitated complexes were filtered and thoroughly washed with alcohol-water 1:1 (v/v) and air dried. Yields were in the range of 85-90 %. The obtained white powders of compounds 8-20 melted with decomposition at temperatures higher than 350 C, and were poorly soluble in water and alcohol, but had good solubilities in DMSO, DMF as well as mixtures of DMSO-water, DMF-water. <br><br> Pharmacology Carbonic anhydrase inhibition Initial rates of 4-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolysis catalysed by different CA isozymes were monitored spectrophotometrically, at 400 rim, with a Cary 3 instrument interfaced with an IBM compatible PC [35]. Solutions of substrate were prepared in anhydrous acetonitrile; the substrate concentrations varied between 2.10-2 and 1.10-6 M, working at 25C. A molar absorption coefficient of 18,400 M-l.cm-1 was used for the 4-nitrophenolate formed by hydrolysis, in the conditions of the experiments (pH 7.40), as reported in the literature [35]. Non-enzymatic hydrolysis rates were always subtracted from the observed rates. Duplicate experiments were done for each inhibitor concentration, and the values reported throughout the paper are the mean of such results. Stock solutions of inhibitor (1 mM) were prepared in distilled-deionized water with 1020% (v/v) DMSO (which is not inhibitory at these concentrations [2]) and dilutions up to 0.01 nM were done thereafter with distilled-deionized water. Inhibitor and enzyme solutions were preincubated together for 10 min at room temperature prior to assay, in order to allow for the formation of the E-I complex. The inhibition constant KI was determined as described by Pocket and Stone [35]. Enzyme concentrations were 3.3 nM for hCA II, l0 nM for hCA and 34 nM for bCA IV (this isozyme has a decreased esterase activity [36] and higher concentrations had to be used for the-measurements). <br><br> Measurement of tonometric lOP Adult male New Zealand albino <span class="blue">rabbits</span> weighing 2-3 kg were used in the experiments (three animals were used for each inhibitor studied). The experimental procedures conform to the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Resolution on the use of animals. The <span class="blue">rabbits</span> were kept in individual cages with food and water provided ad libitum. The animals were maintained on a 12 h: 12 h light/dark cycle in a temperature controlled room, at 22-26 C. Solutions of inhibitors (2 %, by weight) were obtained in DMSOwater (2:3, v/v) due to the low water solubility of some of these derivatives. Control experiments with DMSO (at the same concentration as that used for obtaining the inhibitors solutions showed that it does not possess IOP lowering or increasing effects. IOP was measured using a Digilab 30R pneumatonometer (BioRad, Cambridge, MA, USA) as described by Maren's group [37-39]. The pressure readings were matched with two-point standard pressure measurements at least twice each day using a Digilab Calibration verifier. All IOP measurements were done by the same investigator with the same tonometer. One drop of 0.2 % oxybuprocaine hydrochloride (novesine, Sandoz) diluted 1"1 with saline was instilled in each eye immediately before each set of pressure measurements. IOP was measured three times at each time interval, and the means reported. IOP was measured first immediately before drug administration, then at 30 min after the instillation of the pharmacological agent, and then each 30 minutes for a period of several hours. For all IOP experiments drug was administered to only one eye, leaving the contralateral eye as an untreated control. The ocular hypotensive activity is expressed as the average difference in IOP between the treated and control eye, in this way minimizing the diurnal, seasonal and interindividual variations commonly observed in the <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> [37-39]. All data are expressed as mean SE, using a one-tailed test. Results and Discussion Reaction of 5-amino-l,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide 6 [19b] with chloroacteyl chloride in the presence of pyridine afforded 5-(chloroacetamido)-l,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide 7, by the procedure already reported by Young et al. [34] (Scheme 1). The sulfonamide 7 has been characterized by elemental analysis and spectroscopic methods which confirmed its structure (only its m.p. has been reported in ref. [34]). The sodium salt of sulfonamides 6 and 7, obtained in situ from the corresponding sulfonamide and sodium hydroxide, were then used for the preparation of coordination compounds, containing the following metal ions: Be(II), Mg(II), Al(III), Zn(II), Cd(II) and Hg(II). Mention should be made that although 5-amino-l,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide 6 is the parent compound of important sulfonamide CA inhibitors, such as acetazolamide, benzolamide, methazolamide, etc., its coordination chemistry has been scarcely investigated up to now [22, 40]. The new complexes prepared in this work are shown in Table I. Both compounds containing the sulfonamide-deprotonated species of sulfonamide 7 (LH), as well as complexes in which the anion of 5amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide (tda) act as ligands, have been prepared. In fact in another work [40] it was documented that in some cases, sulfonamides derived from this ring system may undergo hydrolysis to <br><br> 309 <br><br> Vol. 4, No. 6, 1997 <br><br> Metal Complexes of Heterocyclic Sulfonamides."

On the other hand, when the ligand 7 has not been hydrolyzed (during the preparation of the coordination compounds) in the presence of the metal ion to 5-amino-l,3,4-thiadiazole-2sulfonamide and chloroacetate, the metal complexes contining 6 as ligand have been prepared from the last (pure) compound (as sodium salt) and the corresponding metal salt, by the general procedure described in the Experimental part.

The new complexes have also been characterized by spectroscopic, conductimetric and thermogravimetric measurements (Table II). By comparing the IR spectra of the complexes and the corresponding ligands, the following observations should be made: (i) the shift of the two sulfonamido vibrations (both the symmetric as well as the the assymetric one), towards lower wavenumbers in the spectra of the complexes, as compared to the spectra of the corresponding ligand (Table II), as already documented previously for similar complexes [13-22]. This is a direct indication that the deprotonated sulfonamido 310 <br><br> Claudiu T. Supuran et al. <br><br> Metal-Based Drugs <br><br> moieties of the ligands interacts with the metal ions in the newly prepared coordination compounds; (ii) the amide vibrations (the most intense such bands at 1670-1680 cm-1) of ligand 7 appear unchanged in the IR spectra of complexes 15-20 (data not shown), suggesting that these moieties do not participate in coordination of the metal ions; (iii) the C-N stretching vibration in the spectra of the prepared complexes is shifted with 5-20 cm-1 towards lower wavenumbers, as compared to the same vibration in the spectra of sulfonamides 6 and 7, indicating that one of the endocyclic nitrogens of the thiadiazolic ring (presumably N3) acts as donor atom, as already documented by X-ray crystallographic and spectroscopic determinations on complexes of other sulfonamides (such as 1-3) with divalent metal ions [13-22] (Table II); (iv) changes in the region 3100-3160 cm-, as the bands present in the spectra of sulfonamides 6, 7 are present in the spectra of complexes 8-20 too, but they are not well resolved, and have a smaller intensity. This is probably due to deprotonation of the SO2NH2 moiety and participation in the binding of cations; (v) the amino vibrations from 3320 cm- in the spectra of 6 appear unchanged in the spectra of its complexes 8-14 (data not s.hown). In the 1H-NMR spectra of compound 6 and its metal complexes, the signal of the amino group has been evidenced as a broad singlet centered at 4.54 ppm (Table II), which is not exchangeable by addition of D20 into the NMR tube, in contrast to the sulfonamido NH2 protons (which readily exchange). This proves that the 5-amino moiety is not involved in binding the metal ions, as already shown in the X-ray crystallographic work of the complex [Zn(tda)z(NH3)].H20 previously reported [40]. For sulfonamide 7 the CONH proton resonates as a singlet at 12.22 ppm. In complexes 15-20 only very minor shifts of this signal were evidenced (Table II), proving basically that the CONH moiety does not interact with the metal ions in these complexes. <br><br> Table II: Spectroscopic, thermogravimetric and conductimetric data for compounds 6-20. <br><br> 1H-NMR Spectrab Comp.

All these compounds behaved as non-electrolytes in DMF as solvent (Table II). Mention should be made that the Mg(II) complex of sulfonamide 7 could not be isolated. Instead, only the correponding complex of 5-amino-l,3,4-thiadiazole has been obtained from reaction mixtures containing magnesium salts and the sodium salt of 7, probably due to a metal ion assisted hydrolysis of 7 to 6 and chloroacetate. Generally such hydrolytic processes involve highly acidic conditions and prolonged heating of the 5-alkylamido-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide derivatives [41 ], but they might become milder by taking into account the putative catalytic effect of Mg2+ ions reported here. The data shown above lead to the conclusion that ligand 7 shares a common coordination chemistry with acetazolamide 1 with which it is structurally related, whereas 6 probably also behaves similarly to acetazolamide in the sense that the 5-amino group seems not to be involved in coordinating metal ions, at 311 <br><br> Vol. 4, No. 6, 1997 <br><br> Metal Complexes of Heterocyclic Sulfonamides: A New Class ofAntiglaucoma Agents <br><br> least in the complexes reported by us here (and also in the compound characterized by X-ray crystallography mentioned above [40]). Thus, in all complexes reported here these sulfonamides (as monodeprotonated species at the SO2NH 2 moieties) act as bidentate ligands, through the endocyclic N-3 and the NH- groups. The proposed formulae of the new complxes are shown below. Except for the two Pb(II) complexes 13 and 20, as well as the AI(III) derivatives 14 and 16, which presumably are pseudo-octahedral, the other derivatives are supposed to contain tetrahedral M(II) ions. <br><br> R <br><br> R 13"R = 20" R= <br><br> H2N <br><br> CICH2CONH <br><br> 14: R = 16: R = <br><br> H2N CICH2CONH <br><br> The compounds 6-20 together with the standard CA inhibitors 1-5 were assayed for inhibition against three isozymes, hCA I, hCA II and bCA IV (Table III). As seen from the above data, the chloracetamido derivative is more inhibitory than acetazolamide, methazolamide and dichlorophenamide, whereas the unacylated compound 6 is less inhibitory than the above sulfonamides. The metal complexes 820 are much more inhibitory than the sulfonamides from which they derive 6, 7 and than all other simple sulfonamides assayed. They behave similarly to the metal complexes of acetazolamide, methazolamide or dorzolamide previously reported by this group, which were all more inhibitory than the parent sulfonamide from which were prepared [16-22, 40]. Particularly strong inhibition was observed for the Zn(II), Hg(II), Pb(II) and Cd(II) complexes, especially against CA II and CA IV, the isozymes critical for aqueous humor formation. In vivo IOP lowering experiments were done in <span class="blue">rabbits</span> with some of the new compounds prepared in the present work, such as the sulfonamides 6 and 7, and their Zn(II) complexes, which were among the strong CA II and CA IV inhibitors in the obtained series.

On the other hand, dorzolamide, the first topical sulfonamide used clinically in the treatment of glaucoma is an effective such agent, with a decrease of lOP of around 4 mm Hg, one hour after administration directly into the eye (Table IV). From the data of this table, it is obvious that the metal complexes of heterocyclic sulfonamides investigated by us behave as much more effective IOP lowering agents than dorzolamide, and their effect is generally longerlasting (Fig. 1). A last remark should be made about the possible mechanism of action of the new class of IOP lowering agents. Obviously, their activity is due to inhibition of CA isozymes present in the cilliary processes within the eye, similarly to other topically active sulfonamides [2-6]. The fact that the sulfonamide per se is inactive via the topical route, whereas the metal complexes result much better than the drug <br><br> 313 <br><br> Vol. 4, No. 6, 1997 <br><br> Metal Complexes of Heterocyclic Sulfonamides."

Our hypothesis is that the presence of the metal ion in the molecules of these complex inhibitors induces a dramatic change in their physico-chemical properties as compared to those of the parent sulfonamide. This phenomenon is certainly governed by the strong polarization induced by the metal ions. In this way, it is quite probable that the right balance between the lipo- and hydrosolubility of these compounds is achieved, which has been considered to be the critical factor for not observing topical activity in the classical CA inhibitors, such as acetazolamide, methazolamide and ethoxzolamide, which were either too lipophilic or too hy.drosoluble [2,3]. So, by choosing different metal ions and diverse sulfonamides, much larger possibilities arise to finely tune the pharmacological properties which strongly influence the value of a drug. In conclusion we describe here a novel class of lOP lowering agents, ie, the metal complexes of sulfonamide CA inhibitors. These derivatives appear to be very active and longer lasting than the drug dorzolamide, and might constitute the premises for a new generation of antiglaucoma drugs. <br><br> Acknowledgments.
