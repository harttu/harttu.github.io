Abstract
Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) was originally described as a non-histone chromosomal protein and is required for transcriptional gene silencing and the formation of heterochromatin. Although it is localized primarily at pericentric heterochromatin, a scattered distribution over a large number of euchromatic loci is also evident. Here, we provide evidence that <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> HP1 is essential for the maintenance of active transcription of euchromatic genes functionally involved in cell-cycle progression, including those required for DNA replication and mitosis. Depletion of HP1 in proliferating embryonic cells caused aberrant progression of the cell cycle at S phase and G2/M phase, linked to aberrant chromosome segregation, cytokinesis, and an increase in apoptosis. The chromosomal distribution of Aurora B, and the level of phosphorylation of histone H3 serine 10 were also altered in the absence of HP1. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we further demonstrate that the promoters of a number of cell-cycle regulator genes are bound to HP1, supporting a direct role for HP1 in their active transcription. Overall, our data suggest that HP1 is essential for the maintenance of cell-cycle progression and the transcription of cell-cycle regulatory genes. The results also support the view that HP1 is a positive regulator of transcription in euchromatin.<br><br>INTRODUCTION
Chromatin in higher eukaryotes is subdivided into different functional compartments termed heterochromatin and euchromatin (1). Heterochromatin differs from euchromatin in its DNA composition, replication timing, condensation throughout the cell cycle, and its ability to silence euchromatic genes placed adjacent to or within its territory, often described as position-effect-variegation (PEV) (2).
Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) was the first protein identified in <span class="yellow">Drosophila melanogaster</span> as a heterochromatin-associated protein (3); the corresponding gene has been cloned from a number of organisms and is highly conserved from <span class="yellow">yeast</span> to <span class="yellow">human</span> (4). Polytene chromosome staining showed that, in <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span>, HP1 is distributed mainly in pericentric heterochromatin, telomeric heterochromatin, the banded small fourth chromosome (5–8), as well as ∼200 individual loci scattered throughout the euchromatic chromosomal arms (5). The gene encoding HP1 in <span class="yellow">D.melanogaster</span>, Su(var)2-5, was isolated as a suppressor of PEV (9–11). The protein contains a highly conserved motif, the chromo (chromatin organization modifier) domain, similar to Polycomb (Pc), a repressor of homeotic genes (12). The association between HP1 and pericentric heterochromatin is believed to occur via the chromo domain of HP1 and the N-terminal tail of histone H3 methylated at lysine 9 (13,14), generated by histone methyltransferase-Su(var)3-9, a partner of HP1 in pericentric heterochromatin (15). The C-terminal chromo ‘shadow’ domain of HP1 interacts with other silencing complexes to suppress local transcriptional activity (15–18). However, studies of HP1 chromosomal distribution also showed that HP1 does not always co-localize with lysine 9 methylated histone H3 or Su(var)3-9, especially in euchromatic regions (19–21); in some cases, HP1 is found directly bound to DNA (22,23). All these features argue for distinct roles for HP1 in chromatin and in epigenetic gene regulation.
HP1 is believed to be an essential structural protein protecting the integrity of chromosomes during cell division (8,24). Swi6, the homolog of HP1 in <span class="yellow">fission yeast</span>, is dispensable for survival, but its deletion results in lagging chromosomes during anaphase, and a high rate of chromosome loss (25,26). Mutations of HP1 in <span class="yellow">D.melanogaster</span> result in late larval lethality, chromosome breakages/loss, telomere fusion and a high frequency of cells with abnormal anaphase (8,27). Null alleles of the HP1 functional partner in <span class="blue">mice</span> (SUVAR39) also showed various chromosomal defects (28), supporting a conserved role for heterochromatin proteins in the regulation of chromosome dynamics during cell-cycle progression. However, the mechanism(s) involved remains to be understood.
In this study, we utilized <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> embryonic Kc cells and an RNA interference (RNAi)-based approach to demonstrate that HP1 plays an important role at S phase and G2/M phases during the cell cycle. We further show that nearly one-third of known/predicted cell-cycle regulators require HP1 to maintain their active transcription. These genes include MCMs, Orc4, CDC45L, INCENP, Aurora B, CAF1, Bub1, Bub3 and a few other cell-cycle regulators. ChIP analysis suggests that HP1 plays a direct role in their transcription. Therefore, the results of this study provide an alternative explanation for the specific role of HP1 in the regulation of chromatin dynamics and in cell-cycle progression.<br><br>MATERIALS AND METHODS
RNAi in Kc cells
<span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> Kc cells were routinely cultured at 25°C in Schneider <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal <span class="yellow">calf</span> serum, 160 μg/ml penicillin, 250 μg/ml streptomycin, and 4 mM l-glutamine. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of HP1 was generated by incubation of single-stranded RNA in annealing buffer (100 mM potassium acetate, 30 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mM magnesium acetate) for 3 min at 95°C and then placed in a beaker with water at 75°C and allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. The detailed procedure of RNAi was carried out according to the established protocols (). Briefly, Kc cells were seeded in a six-well dish using serum-free medium at 1 × 106 cells/ml. HP1 dsRNA (5 μg/ml) was added to the cultured Kc cells. After 60 min at room temperature, 2 ml of medium containing 10% serum was added to each well and the plates transferred to 25°C for up to 8 days. Western blotting and RT–PCR were carried out using the extract/total RNA isolated from control and dsRNA-treated cells on days 2, 6 and 8.<br><br>Cell-cycle and apoptosis analysis
The procedure for flow cytometric analysis of Kc cells followed that in the manual provided with the BrdU flow kit (BD PharMingen). The cells were fed with BrdU for 4 h, then scraped and collected. Fluorescence was measured using a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson). Data collection and analysis were performed using CellQuest software.<br><br>Electrophoresis and immunoblotting
Cell extracts (15 μg) were fractionated by 10% SDS–PAGE, then transferred to Hybond-P PVDF membranes (Amersham) and probed with primary antibodies (CIA9), and secondary antibodies (anti-<span class="yellow">rabbit</span> or anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> <span class="yellow">horseradish</span> peroxidase-conjugated IgG), obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories. Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used for signal detection.
For the analysis of H3 ser10 phosphorylation, we used whole-cell extracts from 700 000 Kc cells (control and RNAi at day 8). Western blotting was performed using polyclonal antibodies against ser10-phosphorylated histone H3 at a dilution of 1:1000 (Upstate). Kc control cells arrested in mitosis by incubation in 25 µM colchicine (Sigma) for 24 h were also analyzed for comparison.<br><br>Immunofluorescence
Kc cells were seeded onto polylysine slides, fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. The incubation with primary antibodies was carried out in blocking solution for 1 h.
For staining of mitotic cells, the cells were permeabilized using PBST (PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100) and stained with polyclonal antibody against <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> Aurora B at 1:200 dilution and monoclonal <span class="yellow">mouse</span> at anti-β-tubulin 1:300 dilution (Chemicon International) as primary antibodies. Secondary antibodies were anti-<span class="yellow">rabbit</span> coupled with Alexa 488 (1:500) and anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> coupled to Alexa 546 (1:500) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon). Images were acquired using a confocal LSM510 META microscope (Zeiss). Stacks of images were analyzed using the IMARIS 4.0 program (Media cybernetics, Carlsbad, CA).<br><br>Antibodies
Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies of HP1 (<span class="yellow">rabbit</span> #192 and #187, 5 μg) and 5 μg of polyclonal anti-HA antibodies (Sigma) were used in each ChIP reaction. The specificity of the HP1 polyclonal antibodies was determined using various approaches, including western blotting assay, immunofluorescence staining and immunoprecipitation to pull down HP1 (data not shown). The monoclonal antibody HP1–CIA9 (5) was used at a dilution of 1:20 in immunoblotting assays.<br><br>Microarray analysis and RT–PCR
Total RNA was isolated from control and HP1-depleted Kc cells at day 8 using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA labeling and microarray data analysis followed the standard protocol from Affymetrix. We used ANOVA (P < 0.001) to assess the expression confidence for each gene.
For RT–PCR analysis, poly(A)+ mRNA was purified with the Oligotex Direct mRNA kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified poly(A)+ RNA was reverse transcribed using the Thermoscript kit (Invitrogen). The cDNA was then used for PCR amplification for 35 cycles with gene-specific primers. PCR products were scanned after electrophoretic separation with a Typhoon Scanner, quantified using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences) and normalized for amplification of the Actin5c transcript. The sequence of primers used for RT–PCR and ChIP analysis are provided in the Supplementary Material.<br><br>ChIP
ChIP was performed according to Orlando et al. (29) and the protocol provided by Upstate () with some modifications. In brief, 1–2 × 108 Kc cells were prepared and fixed in 1% formaldehyde. Nuclei were isolated according to a standard procedure in Current Protocols (), then resuspended in 1.7 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS and protease inhibitors) and sonicated using a Branson sonifier 250. Chromatin fractions in the size range 0.2–0.8 kb were used to perform immunoprecipitation experiments. We used 5 μg affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies (#192 and #182 for HP1; HA antibody for control) and 1 ml of <span class="yellow">salmon</span> sperm DNA/protein-A-agarose (Upstate) pre-cleared chromatin lysate in each reaction. The mixture was then rotated at 4°C overnight and the recovered beads were washed twice with 1 ml of Low salt buffer (Upstate), once with High salt buffer (Upstate), once with LiCl buffer (Upstate) and twice with TE at 4°C for 8 min. ChIP DNA was extracted according to the standard procedures (29).<br><br>
RESULTS
Depletion of HP1 in <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> Kc cells
Various chromosomal defects in the cell cycle have been observed in embryos or larval tissues of <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> HP1 mutants (8,27). However, the presence of maternally loaded HP1 in embryos and the lethality of HP1 mutants at late larval stages have so far precluded a systematic study of the role of HP1 in cell-cycle regulation. Therefore, we used <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> Kc cells, a cell line derived from <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> embryos, as a model system to address this problem. HP1 transcripts were depleted using an RNAi-based approach (see Materials and Methods). The reduction in HP1 expression was measured both by RT–PCR and by western blotting analysis (Figure 1A). A significant reduction in the HP1 expression was already evident after 2 days treatment with HP1 dsRNA. Cells at day 8 showed a reduction in HP1 of ∼90% (Figure 1A) and were therefore used in all subsequent experiments.<br><br>Cell-cycle progression at S and G2/M phase is altered in the absence of HP1
The impact of HP1 loss on the cell cycle of Kc cells was determined using cell-cycle profile analysis of HP1-depleted and control cells. The percentage of cells in S phase was determined by BrdU incorporation, and total DNA content by 7-amino-actinomycin (7-AAD). The results showed that the depletion of HP1 (day 8) caused a decrease in S-phase cells of at least 4-fold, and a 2-fold decrease in G2/M-phase cells (Figure 1B), although no significant effect was found at the G1 phase. In addition, depletion of HP1 caused a greater than 7-fold increase in the number of apoptotic cells. These results, therefore, confirm that HP1 is an important regulator during the cell cycle, especially at the S and G2/M phases.<br><br>Cell-cycle regulators require HP1 to maintain their active transcription
To ask whether the cell-cycle defects were due to changes in the transcription of genes functionally involved in S phase and the G2/M phase, we next assessed global changes in gene transcription following depletion of HP1. Expression profile analysis was performed using total RNA isolated from both HP1-depleted Kc cells and control Kc cells, and an Affymetrix <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> chip. For each experiment, we used total RNA isolated from two independent HP1-depleted and control samples, and at least two independent experiments were performed.
The microarray analysis showed that loss of HP1 function in Kc cells resulted in alterations in transcription of >500 genes: ∼400 genes were down-regulated and ∼120 genes were up-regulated (>1.5-fold, ANOVA). The function of these genes ranged from cellular enzymes, signal transduction molecules, and membrane and cell structural proteins, to nucleic acid-binding proteins and cell-cycle regulators (Figure 2A). At the chromosomal level, the genes targeted by HP1 appeared to be distributed along all euchromatic chromosomal arms (data not shown), supporting a global role of HP1 in euchromatic gene regulation (20).
Among 60 known/predicted genes associated with DNA replication function, 15 were down-regulated in the absence of HP1 (Figure 2B). These included McM2, McM5, McM6 and CDC45L, which are required for processive DNA replication and correct chromosome condensation (30–32). Other genes involved in DNA replication, such as components of the origin recognition complex (Orc)—Orc4, Caf1, Gnf1, Dref1, DNA polymerase-γ and Tam—were also down-regulated (Figure 2B). Aurora B and inner centromere protein (INCENP), known to be required for kinetochore assembly, chromosome condensation and bipolar chromosome attachment during mitosis (33), also showed a reduction in transcription. A similar loss of transcription was observed in Bub1 and Bub3 (Figure 2B), encoding mitotic checkpoint control proteins (34,35). Loss function of Bub1 has been shown to cause chromatin bridges to extend between the two separating groups of chromosomes, and extensive chromosome fragmentation in anaphase cells (35).
We confirmed the changes in the transcription of cell-cycle regulators using semi-quantitative RT–PCR, which gave results consistent with the microarray analysis. In addition, cell-cycle regulator genes, such as McM3, McM7 and Asp (abnormal spindle), were also confirmed to be down-regulated (Figure 2C). Collectively, these results demonstrate that HP1 is indeed involved in the regulation of transcription of cell-cycle regulators.<br><br>HP1 is required for Aurora B distribution and histone H3 phosphorylation
INCENP is localized to the centromeric region of chromosomes at metaphase and the spindle midzone at anaphase, which then targets Aurora B, a kinase essential for histone H3 ser10 phosphorylation, to these sites (36). Loss of function of both these ‘chromosomal passenger’ proteins causes abnormal chromosomal segregation at metaphase, as well as certain cytokinesis defects (36,37). The loss of transcription of both INCENP and Aurora B after depletion of HP1, therefore, raised the possibility that localization of Aurora B (Figure 3 and data not shown) may be altered. Staining of HP1-depleted Kc cells with anti-Aurora B antibodies indeed revealed an altered localization of Aurora B and, in a number of cases, a complete loss of Aurora B (Figure 3A). Consistent with the loss function of Aurora B, the spindles in the metaphase cells were also disorganized, with a large number of cells showing an altered prometaphase chromosome alignment (Figure 3A). Some showed extensive chromosome fragmentation (Figure 3B), or the presence of a third spindle pole-like structure as indicated by beta-tubulin (Figure 3A). At telophase, we observed defective separating cells with an extra cell envelope-like structure without nuclei (Figure 3A). Chromatin bridges or lagging chromatids at telophase were also evident in some cells (Figure 3C); however, in some cases, localization of Aurora B appeared not to be affected, arguing that other pathways are possibly involved.
We next analyzed changes in histone H3 serine 10 phosphorylation, since the loss of transcription of INCENP is known to affect localization of Aurora B (33), which is essential in the regulation of histone H3 phosphorylation (36). Total cell extracts from HP1-depleted Kc cells were analyzed by western blotting (Figure 3D). The results indeed showed a severalfold reduction in H3 ser10 phosphorylation after depletion of HP1, consistent with the functional disruption of INCENP and Aurora B in the absence of HP1.<br><br>HP1 directly targets genes encoding cell-cycle regulators in euchromatin
To test whether the loss of transcription of genes involved in DNA replication and mitosis was a direct effect of the loss of HP1, we performed a ChIP analysis to determine whether HP1 is physically associated with these genes. Chromatin lysates from formaldehyde-fixed Kc cells were sonicated into small chromatin fragments (0.2–0.8 kb) and immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies against <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> HP1. As a control, we used a mock precipitation (beads only) and polyclonal antibodies against HA. Our ChIP results showed that known transposable elements distributed in heterochromatin, such as F-element, TART and 1360 (7,38), were all enriched in HP1 binding (Figure 4), which is also consistent with a previous study (20).
Using the same ChIP DNA material, we then attempted to determine whether HP1 was enriched in genes involved in DNA replication. Primers were designed to cover the promoter regions of selected genes. The results showed that McM3, McM5 and Tam were all enriched in HP1 binding (Figure 4). However, McM7 appeared to be HP1-negative, although its transcription was also affected by the loss of HP1 function. Genes essential for mitosis, such as Aurora B, were also HP1-positive (Figure 4). These results demonstrate that these cell-cycle regulator genes are directly targeted by HP1 in their promoter regions.<br><br>
DISCUSSION
In this study, we used microarray and RT–PCR techniques to demonstrate that transcription of cell-cycle regulators is misregulated in the absence of HP1. Certain defects in S phase may be a direct consequence of the loss of transcription of DNA replication genes such as McM2, McM5, McM6, CDC45L, Orc4 and others, since these genes have been functionally implicated in the initiation of DNA replication and/or the progression of replication forks (39). Depletion or mutation of these genes has been shown to result in DNA damage (32), the blockage of replication forks (39), increased chromosome loss/genome instability, and defective condensation (30).
The reduction in the number of cells in G2/M phase may be a consequence of the reduction in transcription or functional disruption of INCENP, Aurora B, Bub1, and Bub3 (34,36). Chromosome segregation defects, such as chromosome fragmentation and chromatin bridges in anaphase/telophase cells, and certain cytokinesis defects in HP1-depleted cells, mimic the phenotype of cells with loss function of INCENP, Aurora B or Bub1 (35–37). The mislocalization of Aurora B in the absence of HP1 is also consistent with the loss of transcription and functional disruption of INCENP (37), and the reduction in Aurora B transcription may be partially responsible for the observed chromosomal defects, including loss of histone H3 phosphorylation at serine 10.
HP1 is also known to physically interact with certain components of replication complexes such as ORCs and MCMs (30,40,41), with the inner centromere protein INCENP (42) and the chromatin assembly factor CAF1 (43) promoting delivery of HP1 to heterochromatin sites (44). Loss of HP1 is, therefore, expected to cause disruption to such HP1-associated complexes, and will partially contribute to the chromatin/chromosomal defects in HP1 mutants (8,27) and HP1-depleted Kc cells. It is therefore well possible that the loss of transcription of these cell-cycle regulator genes, and consequent disruption of HP1 functional complexes or heterochromatin structure, all contributed to the cell-cycle defects observed.
The ChIP assay supports the hypothesis that the loss of transcription of cell-cycle regulator genes is a direct effect of the lack of HP1. Aurora B, McM3, and McM5 were all bound by HP1 at their promoter regions, although other cell-cycle regulators, such as McM7, were HP1-negative, implying that the altered transcription in these genes might be a secondary effect of the loss of HP1.
A previous study in <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> Kc cells (20) employed an approach based on the ectopic expression of a fusion protein of HP1 with a prokaryotic DNA adenine methyltransferase and identified a number of methylated targets in the genome. In this study, MCM3 and MCM5 were not found to be methylated, indicating lack of association with HP1. On the other hand, heterochromatin repeats, such F-element and 1360, were consistently found to be HP1-enriched both here and in the previous study. It remains to be determined whether these discrepancies are due to the different experimental systems used. However, we note that the previous study was performed using a cDNA array, while we observe binding of endogenous HP1 at the promoter of these genes. Similarly, another study using chromatin immunoprecipitation in larvae also showed few HP1-positive genes that were not detected in Kc cells by the Dam ID approach (21).
A large number of genes affected by the loss of <span class="yellow">D.melanogaster</span> HP1 in larval tissues (21) seem to be different from that in embryonic Kc cells. The change in the transcription of Aurora B and few cell-cycle regulators reported in this study is also not found among the HP1-affected genes at larval stage (21). This may be due to specific role(s) of HP1 in different stages of development. Alternatively, it is also possible that the impact of HP1 in the transcription of cell-cycle regulators in proliferating cells is underestimated when performing the analyses on larval tissues, and thus on mixed populations of both proliferating and differentiating/differentiated cells.
HP1 is generally known as a transcriptional repressor, as supported by several lines of evidence: silencing of a euchromatic reporter gene in heterochromatin requires HP1 (10,11), tethering of HP1 next to a euchromatic reporter gene causes silencing (45), and the repression of genes within euchromatic region 31 bound by HP1 is relieved in the absence of HP1 (46). In contrast, genes in heterochromatin, known as heterochromatic genes, such as light and rolled, seem to require HP1 to maintain their active transcription (47,48). The level of transcription of heterochromatic genes was dramatically reduced in a mutated HP1 background (47–49). It was therefore proposed that HP1 may function as a positive regulator of transcription of these genes (50,51), although the exact regulation mechanism remains unclear. A study of heat-shock genes found that HP1 is associated with RNA transcripts in the coding region, and is also a positive regulator of their transcription (52,53). The chromatin association of HP1 at the promoter region of active euchromatic genes demonstrated from this work and others, and its independence from histone H3K9 methylation (21), all suggest that mechanism whereby HP1 modulates transcription of euchromatic genes is potentially distinct from its role in heterochromatin formation.
Collectively, the results of this study demonstrate that HP1 plays an essential role in cell-cycle progression, and support the view that HP1, in addition to its role in heterochromatin, can act as a positive transcriptional regulator of euchromatic genes.<br><br>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL

Abstract
Techniques have been developed for detection, quantitation, and isolation of bacterial metallothioneins (MTs) from <span class="yellow">cyanobacterial</span> species. These methods involve differential pulse polarography and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and have allowed detection of picomole quantities of these high sulfhydryl content proteins. The prokaryotic molecule was found to be induced in the presence of Cd or Zn salts with regulation at the level of transcription. Cu was not found to induce synthesis of the prokaryotic MT. Exposure to the former metals resulted in a growth lag followed by simultaneous induction of MT synthesis and onset of growth. Amino acid analysis and N-terminal sequence analysis indicated that the bacterial MTs from cyanobacteria are unique, having many aromatic and aliphatic residues and no apparent association of hydroxylated or basic amino acids with cysteines. Although the characteristic Cys-X-Cys sequences were present, no apparent amino acid sequence homology with the eukaryotic MTs was found in the first 42 residues.<br><br><br><br>

In the cobalt hexaminechloride supporting electrolyte, the half-wave potential for all MTs studied to date is approximately -1.45 V versus a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. This electrochemical reaction results in highly reproducible and linear current responses which can be used with samples containing picomole levels of MT (Fig. 2). Since this is an exceedingly sensitive instrument, attention to detail is particularly important for successful use of the Brdicka procedure (11). Routine use of a reference standard MT is highly recommended to compensate for small day-today variations in response. For absolute values, standards must be identical to the species of protein quantitated; otherwise commercially available standard is adequate. Although certain tissues and cellular types can be shown to have no other polarographically active material other than MT, with samples from new species, it is necessary to evaluate this potential problem by gelperneation chromatography and, if necessary, take steps to remove contaminants before assaying.

The latter technique is potentially useful in assessing metal speciation and integrity of the protein tertiary structure near metal clusters, particularly after metal reconstitution studies. <br><br> E <br><br> 'C2A-                                    E   24 <br><br> 0           30                            40 E0 <br><br> *~~~~~~~~~~~~ <br><br> o                           C~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~C <br><br> Fraction Number (18ml) <br><br> FIGURE 4.

Comparison with cultures exposed to cadmium chloride (Fig. 6A) or zinc sulfate (Fig. 6C) showed that introduction of metal salts resulted in a growth lag and that resumption of growth occurred coincident with an increase in cellular levels of MT. In addition, it should be noted that, like mammalian MT, cadmium appears to be a more potent inducer than zinc. Twice as much cadmium-thionein was synthesized on exposure to half as much metal as was used in the zinc induction experiment. A further interesting finding was that copper exposure resulted in an even greater growth lag than observed with cadmium, but on resumption of growth in the presence copper, MT synthesis was not noted (Fig. 6D). Recent results suggest that this copper resistance is manifest via a membrane exclusion mechanism (unpublished results). <br><br> HOURS <br><br> FIGURE 7.

If the above cadmium-resistant cells were transferred into fresh media in the absence of cadmium and allowed to grow up between three successive transfers, levels of MT dropped to near basal values as synthesis was repressed in the absence of metal. However, when these cells were now transferred into cadmium-containing media, instead of the predicted growth lag, they grew immediately. Thus, these cells were truly cadmium resistant. Since 50 tubes of wild-type cells at a dilution of 104 grew, after the usual lag on exposure to cadmium-containing media, the acquisition of cadmium resistance in this strain of Synechococcus was therefore considered unlikely to be related to a chromosomal mutational event. Such a mutation frequency would be unreasonably high. Although no direct evidence exists at this time, this metal resistance phenomenon is best explained by the amplification of an extrachromosomal gene, especially since this strain is known to have plasmids. <br><br> Structure of Cyanobacterial MT <br><br> The structural determination of <span class="yellow">cyanobacterial</span> MT is not yet complete, although a substantial amount of information is now known. For example, Table 1 compares the amino acid composition of a <span class="yellow">Synechococcus TX-20</span> isoprotein with two eukaryotic MTs. These data indicate that the bacterial form is unique. While cysteine was still the predominant amino acid in this protein, levels of the amino acid were half that seen in the eukaryotes. In addition, the bacterial protein had two tyrosines, three histidines, and five long-chain aliphatics-all residues rarely found in eukaryotic MTs. Thus, the amino acid composition indicates that prokaryotic MTs are not as structurally homologous with eukaryotes as they are physiologically homologous. This was further exemplified on amino terminal amino acid sequence analysis (12). With the exception of the typical Cys-X-Cys sequences, the first 42 residues of the prokaryotic MT were essentially without homology on comparison with the <span class="yellow">crab</span> (<span class="yellow">Scylla</span>), <span class="yellow">human</span>, or <span class="yellow">Neurospora crassa</span> MTs (Table 2). Of the above-mentioned uncommon MT residues, two tyrosines were found together in positions 29 and 30, all five of the long-chain aliphatic amino acids were located in the first 28 residues, and two histidines were situated at positions 37 and 39. Perhaps of greater interest was the complete lack of association of basic residues or hydroxylated residues with cysteines, as is found in eukaryotes (11). Instead, a block of four hydroxylated amino acids was found at the amino terminus. <br><br> The sequence of this unique MT is now nearing completion, opening the way for an X-ray crystallographic investigation. However, the degree of similarity between the metal cluster arrangement of these bacterial molecules with the eukaryotic structures will initially be undertaken spectroscopically. Reliable interpretation of the 113Cd-NMR data for this molecule will be dependent upon adequate isolation of isoproteins using RP-HPLC and assessment of conformational integrity of metal reconstituted molecules, using procedures such as cyclic voltametry. Studies along these lines are presently underway in this laboratory <br><br> The author gratefully acknowledges the financial support of the Australian Institute of Marine Science and the National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

Abstract
A modifying influence of ortho-cresol (o-cresol) on the carcinogenic effect of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) with combined oral administration to CC57Br <span class="blue">mice</span> had been found. During simultaneous administration of o-cresol (1 mg) and BaP (1 mg), the incidence of tumors, the multiplicity of tumors, and the degree of malignancy all increased, but the latency was shortened. When o-cresol was administered before or after BaP (in identical doses), the carcinogenic effect was weakened. When o-cresol (10 mg) and BaP (5 mg) were administered simultaneously, the incidence of malignant tumors was similar to controls receiving BaP only (13.8%), indicating inhibition of carcinogenesis.<br><br><br><br>

Both enhancing or weakening effects have been seen (1-12). In some experiments ubiquitious environmental carcinogenic and toxic chemical pollutants were used (13-17). <br><br> The stimulating effect of phenol, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide upon BaP's blastogenic action on the respiratory tract and phenol on the digestive tract (forestomach) have been reported (12-18). We have established the relationship between the doses of carcinogenic and toxic agents and their modifying effects (17,18). The maximal enhancing effect was observed after BaP (2.5 mg) and NO2 (0.87 mg/m3) were exposed to <span class="yellow">rat</span> respiratory tract. The effect weakened with decreasing dose. At concentrations at the MPC level (MPC BaP, 1 ng/m3, MPC NO2, 0.04 mg/m3) no effect was seen. Phenol at 1 mg orally to CC57Br <span class="blue">mice</span> enhanced the BaP (1 mg) effect, but no effect was seen at 0.02 mg. Phenolic compounds showed either enhancing or inhibiting effects on carcinogenesis depending on their chemical structure (16,18-25). <br><br> This report presents the results of combined oral administration of BaP and artho-cresol (o-cresol) in <span class="blue">mice</span>, <br><br> 'Ukrainian State Medical Center for Environmental Health, Kiev, Ukraine. <br><br> Address reprint requests to N.

Animals were divided in 15 groups. This experiment included three types of sequential combinations for the introduction of compounds: a) simultaneous BaP and o-cresol administration; b) BaP after o-cresol (stage 1); and c) BaP before o-cresol (stage 2). Appropriate controls were included (Table 1). <br><br> The chemicals were administered twice per week (for a total of 10, 20, and 40 doses) using a syringe and a needle with a soldered olive on its tip. BaP (1 or 5 mg) or o-cresol (0.02, 1, or 10 mg) was placed in triethylene glycol (TEG) and administered as 0.1-mL water solutions. The evaluation of o-cresol's modifying effect on the incidence of tumors, especially malignant tumors, the tumor latency period (tl), and the average time (ta) of the appearance of tumors, as well as the multiplicity index, M (the average number of tumors per animal for tumor-bearing animals) was recorded. Because the M could be identified at the initial stage of carcinogenesis by the third month after the beginning of the trial when neoplasms began to emerge, moribund animals were killed by ether inhalation if they did not die spontaneously. <br><br> The experiments with large chemical doses (BaP, 5 mg; o-cresol, 10 mg) lasted for 30 weeks. Some animals were killed after the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 10th procedures for the <br><br> YANYSHEVA ET AL. <br><br> evaluation of initial stages of carcinogenesis; others were killed at 26 and 30 weeks. The stomachs were distended with formalin solution and the mucosa examined macroscopically. All tumors > 1 mm in diameter were recorded. Organs and tissues were fised in 10% neutral formalin solution, embedded in paraffin and routine histological slides prepared. Microscopic data were processed according to Mostkovoy (30). <br><br> Results <br><br> The data from this study demonstrate the modifying influence of o-cresol on BaP-induced carcinogenesis with combined oral exposure. The combined exposure and BaP alone caused benign and malignant epithelial tumors of the forestomach. The benign neoplasms were papillomas, and the malignant neoplasms were invasive carcinomas. <br><br> The combined administration of BaP and o-cresol showed different results depending on doses and sequential combinations of both chemicals. As shown in Table 2, the simultaneous administration of BaP (1 mg) and o-cresol (1 mg) affected all parameters of carcinogenesis that were measured. This included a significant increase in the incidence of tumors, shortening of the time to the appearance of the first tumor, and the mean time of tumor <br><br> development as compared to animals that received 1 mg of BaP alone and had tumors. One hundred percent of the <span class="blue">mice</span> that received 5 mg of BaP alone had tumors. <br><br> Shortening of the time to appearance of malignant tumors was also observed: the <span class="blue">mice</span> with forestomach cancer died between 23 and 26.2 weeks after the beginning of experiment, but the controls survived to 58.5 weeks. Muliple small metastases in the lungs and mediastinum were found in 42.8% of <span class="blue">mice</span>, which signifies a high degree of malignancy. <br><br> o-Cresol at 0.02 mg did not modify carcinogenesis in comparison to the control. o-Cresol administration before or after BaP did not modify tumor incidence or the multiplicity index as compared to control, but the latency period was longer (Table 2). When o-cresol was administered after BaP (stage 2), there was an absence of malignant tumors. <br><br> Besides the quantitative aspects, other peculiarities of carcinogenesis in <span class="blue">mice</span> simultaneously administered BaP and o-cresol should be noted.

At autopsy, enlargement of the stomach with tuberculous white superficial vegetations were observed. The forestomach and glandular part of the stomach was often obliterated by tumor masses. <br><br> The stomach was often adhered to the pancreas, liver, and mesentery. Hemmorrhage and inflammation were found in tumors foci. When o-cresol was introduced before BaP, the tumors were more frequently found closer to the small curvature of the stomach between the forestomach and esophageal entrance. Over the large curvature less prominent mucosal folds were observed. Microscopically, a decrease in mucosa papillae, epithelial atrophy (one to two cullular layers), decreased keratonization, and nuclear pycnosis were observed. With the simultaneous administration of large doses of o-cresol and BaP, the final carcinogenic effect (30 weeks after the first dose) was similar to BaP alone but differences were observed at the earlier stages (after the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 10th exposures). <br><br> In the BaP control, multiple forestomach epithelial proliferative and hyperplastic changes were found after the third dose. Multiple papillomas occurred (9-15 in each <span class="yellow">mouse</span>). The stomach's mucosal folds appeared thickened diffusely, then papillomas appeared and finally merged together. <br><br> Approximately half of the tumors were malignant. The neoplasms filled almost the whole forestomach cavity and infiltrated the wall with tuberculous vegetations, which were visible on the serosal surface. Thmor infiltration in the liver, pancreas, and wide dissemination of peritoneum were also observed. In <span class="blue">mice</span> simultaneously administered BaP and o-cresol, the proliferative alterations of forestomach epithelium were seen after the third dose. However, they occurred as the single foci at damaged mucosa and even in the later stages were not diffuse. Adjacent to the hyperplastic foci, the mucosa was atrophied with decreased keratonization. The epithelial cells also showed cytoplasm coagulation and nuclear pycnosis. Edema, inflammation of the mucosa, submucosa microabscesses, and erosion were seen. There were fewer papillomas per <span class="yellow">mouse</span> (four to eight in each <span class="yellow">mouse</span>) than in the control group. Even in the late stages the papillomas were isolated and elevated on the atrophied mucosal folds. <br><br> In the final experiment the papillomas prevailed as compared to the previous experiments. Only 4 out of 29 <span class="blue">mice</span> (13.8%) developed malignant tumors. Neoplasms were smaller and appeared as single verrucosa vegetations 5-10 mm in diameter. Thus, the toxic dose of o-cresol inhibits the carcinogenic process of induced forestomach tumors by decreasing multiplicity, frequency, and percentage of malignant tumors. <br><br> Discussion <br><br> Our results and the literature suggest a hypothesis on modifying carcinogenesis mechanisms. The primary effect of the toxic agents, including carcinogenic agents, may relate to cellular membrane damage with the subsequent increased permeability (31-35), which may be the mechanism of the o-cresol. <br><br> With simultaneous introduction of o-cresol at low toxic doses and BaP there may be increased carcinogen penetration to the target cells. In addition, membrane damage may alter other cellular systems responsible for energy and xenobiotic detoxication. Damage of these processes may activate free-radical reactions, glycolysis, or alter carcinogenic metabolism, which promotes the oncogenic effect. The o-cresol effect on these systems was confirmed by our previous investigations on cytochrome P450, ferrosulfuric nonhemic proteins, and semiquinon radical content affected by the combined action of BaP and o-cresol (36). <br><br> Another effect was obtained with BaP exposure after o-cresol. The atrophic alterations in the stomach induced by 2.5 months of o-cresol administration might decrease the natural conditions of retention (muscosal folds, frontier torn), and thus shorten the contact of BaP with the forestomach. In our opinion, this explains the decreased carcinogenic effect seen after o-cresol exposure. <br><br> Considering the toxic effect of o-cresol at low toxic doses (1 mg) after BaP and the effect of a super toxic dose (10 mg) simultaneously with BaP administration, it is possible that the inhibition of carcinogenesis in both trials was related to the toxic effects of o-cresol. Cytotoxicity may not only hamper tumor growth, but also promote the regression of inducible and spontaneous neoplasms (37-39). There is also a possibility that BaP damages metabolic systems and decreases resistance to carcinogenesis. <br><br> Conclusions <br><br> The data obtained demonstrate that simultaneous administration of BaP modifies the induced carcinogenesis depending on the dose and the sequence of administration. Administered with BaP (1 mg), a low toxic o-cresol dose (about minimally effective) produces an enhanced cocarcinogenic effect reflected in the incidence, frequency, multiplicity, and degree of malignancy of forestomach tumors. <br><br> o-Cresol administration at low toxic doses before or after BaP at the same dose level (1 mg) and its administration at super toxic doses (10 mg) with the BaP optimal dose (5 mg) may inhibit carcinogenesis. Simultaneous introduction of a noneffective o-cresol dose (0.02 mg) with the BaP (1 mg) does not change its carcinogenic activity. Controlling both chemicals in the environment is the most effective measure of preventing potential risk and is undoubtedly of paramount significance. <br><br> REFERENCES <br><br> 1.

Abstract
Considerable evidence points to a role for B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) overproduction in <span class="yellow">murine</span> and <span class="yellow">human</span> systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Nevertheless, the correlation between circulating levels of BLyS protein and disease activity in <span class="yellow">human</span> SLE is modest at best. This may be due to an inadequacy of the former to reflect endogenous BLyS overproduction faithfully, in that steady-state protein levels are affected not just by production rates but also by rates of peripheral utilization and excretion. Increased levels of BLyS mRNA may better reflect increased in vivo BLyS production, and therefore they may correlate better with biologic and clinical sequelae of BLyS overexpression than do circulating levels of BLyS protein. Accordingly, we assessed peripheral blood leukocyte levels of BLyS mRNA isoforms (full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS) and plasma BLyS protein levels in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with SLE, and correlated these levels with laboratory and clinical features. BLyS protein, full-length BLyS mRNA, and ΔBLyS mRNA levels were greater in SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> (n = 60) than in rheumatoid arthritis <span class="yellow">patients</span> (n = 60) or normal control individuals (n = 30). Although full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS mRNA levels correlated significantly with BLyS protein levels in the SLE cohort, BLyS mRNA levels were more closely associated with serum immunoglobulin levels and SLE Disease Activity Index scores than were BLyS protein levels. Moreover, changes in SLE Disease Activity Index scores were more closely associated with changes in BLyS mRNA levels than with changes in BLyS protein levels among the 37 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> from whom repeat blood samples were obtained. Thus, full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS mRNA levels are elevated in SLE and are more closely associated with disease activity than are BLyS protein levels. BLyS mRNA levels may be a helpful biomarker in the clinical monitoring of SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>.<br><br>Introduction
B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS; a trademark of <span class="yellow">Human</span> Genome Sciences, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA) is a 285-amino-acid member of the tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily [1-3]. A causal relation between constitutive overproduction of BLyS and development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like illness has incontrovertibly been established in <span class="blue">mice</span>. BLyS-transgenic <span class="blue">mice</span> often develop SLE-like features as they age [3-5], and SLE-prone (NZB × NZW)F1 (BWF1) and MRL-lpr/lpr <span class="blue">mice</span> respond clinically to treatment with BLyS antagonists (decreased disease progression and improved survival) [3,6].
Considerable inferential evidence points to a role for BLyS overproduction in <span class="yellow">human</span> SLE as well. Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated elevated circulating levels of BLyS in 20–30% of <span class="yellow">human</span> SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> tested at a single point in time [7,8]. Moreover, a 12-month longitudinal study documented persistently elevated serum BLyS levels in about 25% of SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> and intermittently elevated serum BLyS levels in an additional 25% of <span class="yellow">patients</span> [9]. Remarkably, circulating BLyS levels did not correlate with disease activity (measured using the SLE Disease Activity Index [SLEDAI]) in these cross-sectional or longitudinal studies [7-9]. Although a statistically significant correlation between circulating BLyS levels and SLEDAI has been appreciated in a more recent 24-month longitudinal study of 245 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> (with >1,700 plasma samples analyzed) [10], the correlation remains weak.
The limited correlation between circulating BLyS protein levels and disease activity in these studies may have exposed an inadequacy of the former to reflect faithfully endogenous BLyS overproduction. In addition to the rate of BLyS protein production, several other factors (for example, utilization and excretion) can affect circulating BLyS protein levels. Although there are no practicable means of directly measuring in vivo BLyS production per se in <span class="yellow">humans</span>, the level of BLyS mRNA may serve as a better surrogate marker of in vivo BLyS production than does the level of BLyS protein. Candidate BLyS mRNA isoforms include the full-length BLyS mRNA isoform, which encodes the full-length protein, and the alternatively spliced ΔBLyS mRNA isoform, which encodes a protein with a small peptide deletion [11]. (ΔBLyS does not bind to cells expressing BLyS receptors, and therefore it has no agonistic activity. Moreover, ΔBLyS can form heterotrimers with full-length BLyS, thereby actually functioning as a dominant-negative antagonist of BLyS activity.)
In this report we demonstrate that peripheral blood leukocytes from SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> express elevated mRNA levels of both full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS relative to those levels expressed by <span class="yellow">patients</span> with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or by normal control individuals. In the SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>, both full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS mRNA levels are more closely associated with disease activity (SLEDAI) than are BLyS protein levels. Accordingly, BLyS mRNA levels may be a helpful biomarker in the clinical monitoring of SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>.<br><br>Materials and methods
General details
This study was approved by the institutional review boards of the University of Southern California and the Scripps Research Institute. All <span class="yellow">participants</span> gave their written informed consent before participation in this study.<br><br><span class="yellow">Participants</span>
<span class="yellow">Patients</span> receiving outpatient medical care at the rheumatology clinics of the Los Angeles County + University of Southern California Medical Center were recruited into the study. Diagnoses of SLE (n = 60) or RA (n = 60) were based on established clinical criteria [12]. Healthy control individuals (n = 30) were recruited from Los Angeles County + University of Southern California Medical Center and University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine personnel. No exclusions were made on any basis other than an inability to give informed consent. Each <span class="yellow">patient</span>'s sex, race, age, and medications at the time of the phlebotomy were recorded (Table 1).
Based solely on the <span class="yellow">patient</span>'s willingness to donate a second blood sample, repeat blood samples were collected from 37 of the SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> 147–511 days (median 371 days) after collection of the first samples. These <span class="yellow">patients</span> were not selected on the basis of any demographic, clinical, or laboratory feature.
Clinical disease activity for the SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> was assessed using the SLEDAI [13] and using a modified SLEDAI that excludes the contribution of anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies from the total score. Each <span class="yellow">patient</span>'s medical chart was reviewed for results of standard clinical laboratory tests within the previous or subsequent 1-month period.<br><br>Plasma BLyS determination
Whole venous blood was centrifuged to yield plasma and a buffy coat. The plasma was harvested, stored at -70°C, and assayed for BLyS levels by ELISA [8,14] using Fab fragments of the capture antibody rather than the whole antibody to reduce assay interference by rheumatoid factor. The lower limit of detection in this assay is 0.3 ng/ml. For statistical purposes, plasma samples with BLyS concentrations below the lower limit of detection were assigned a value of 0.25 ng/ml.<br><br>Blood BLyS mRNA determination
The buffy coat from centrifuged whole blood was harvested, added to RNAlater™ (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) at a 1:4 vol/vol ratio for RNA stabilization, stored at -70°C, and assayed for full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS mRNA levels by real-time PCR. Total RNA was purified from buffy coat samples using RNAeasy miniprep kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), and contaminating genomic DNA was removed by DNAse-I digestion. One-tenth volume of total RNA was used as template in the first-strand cDNA reaction using oligo-dT and the Superscript III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Duplicate samples of cDNA were amplified with primers against β-actin, full-length BLyS, or ΔBLyS: β-actin sense 5'-CGAGAAGATGACCCAGATCATGT-3'; β-actin anti-sense 5'-GGCATACCCCTCGTAGATGG-3'; full-length BLyS sense 5'-GCAGACAGTGAAACACCAACTATAC-3'; ΔBLyS sense 5'-CAGAAGAAACAGGATCTTACACAT-3'; and full-length BLyS/ΔBLyS anti-sense 5'-TGCCAGCTGAATAGCAGGAATTAT-3'.
A 165 bp amplicon for β-actin was PCR-amplified using the 7900 HT ABI Prism machine (Qiagen) with annealing at 65°C. A 296 bp amplicon for full-length BLyS was PCR-amplified, with annealing at 64°C. A 270 bp amplicon for ΔBLyS was PCR-amplified with annealing at 61°C. The annealing conditions for full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS were determined so that each primer set remained specific to the respective BLyS isoform and yielded a PCR efficiency similar to those of cloned cDNA standards. Melting curve analysis revealed a single peak for each gene amplified. The threshold cycle (Ct) values for each reaction were determined using Sequence Detection System software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Results are presented as ratios of full-length BLyS or ΔBLyS mRNA to β-actin mRNA, which were calculated using the following formulae:
2 exp(Ctβ-actin - Ctfull-length BLyS)
2 exp(Ctβ-actin - CtΔBLyS)<br><br>Determination of anti-BLyS autoantibodies
BLyS was bound to microtiter plates by first coating the plates with streptavidin and then adding biotinylated recombinant BLyS. Using these plates as the capture reagent, plasma samples were incubated, and <span class="yellow">horseradish</span> peroxidase-conjugated anti-<span class="yellow">human</span> IgA/IgM/IgG (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL, USA; 1:20,000 final dilution) or <span class="yellow">horseradish</span> peroxidase-conjugated anti-<span class="yellow">human</span> IgG (Southern Biotechnology; 1:10,000 final dilution) were used as the detector reagents.<br><br>Statistical analysis
All analyses were performed using SigmaStat software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Results that did not follow a normal distribution were log-transformed to achieve normality. Parametric testing between two matched or unmatched groups was performed using the paired or unpaired t test, respectively. Parametric testing among three or more groups was performed using one-way analysis of variance. When log-transformation failed to generate normally distributed data or the equal variance test was not satisfied, nonparametric testing was performed using the Mann–Whitney rank sum test between two groups and by Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance on ranks among three or more groups. Correlations were determined using Pearson product moment correlation for interval data and using Spearman rank order correlation for ordinal data or for interval data that did not follow a normal distribution. Nominal data were analyzed using χ2 analysis-of-contingency tables.<br><br>
Results
Elevated plasma BLyS levels and blood levels of full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS mRNA isoforms in systemic lupus erythematosus <span class="yellow">patients</span>
Previous reports of elevated circulating BLyS levels in SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> were based on a BLyS ELISA that utilized a whole (unfragmented) capture anti-BLyS monoclonal antibody [7-9]. Since the publication of these reports, it has been recognized that the presence of rheumatoid factor can potentially interfere with the assay and lead to spurious overestimation of the true circulating BLyS levels (<span class="yellow">Human</span> Genome Sciences, Inc.; unpublished observations). To mitigate potential interference from rheumatoid factor, the BLyS ELISA has been modified and the capture anti-BLyS monoclonal antibody is now utilized as a Fab fragment. Despite the changes in the ELISA format, our findings are entirely consistent with those of the previous reports. Plasma BLyS levels were significantly greater in the SLE group than in either RA or normal control group (P < 0.001; Figure 1a). Arbitrary assignment of the 95th percentile value among the normal control individuals as the upper limit of 'normal' revealed that two of the 30 normal control individuals, 15 of the 60 RA <span class="yellow">patients</span>, and 29 of the 60 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> harbored elevated plasma BLyS levels (P < 0.001).
Overexpression of BLyS in SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> was also established by measuring BLyS mRNA levels normalized to β-actin mRNA levels in peripheral blood leukocytes (buffy coats). The geometric mean full-length BLyS mRNA and ΔBLyS mRNA levels among the SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> were each significantly greater than those among the RA <span class="yellow">patients</span> and normal control individuals, respectively (P < 0.001 for each; Figure 1b,c). Arbitrary assignment of the 95th percentile values for full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS mRNA levels among the normal control individuals as the upper limits of 'normal' revealed that two of the 30 normal control individuals, four of the 60 RA <span class="yellow">patients</span>, and 20 of the 60 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> had elevated full-length BLyS mRNA levels (P < 0.001), and that two of the 30 normal control individuals, three of the 60 RA <span class="yellow">patients</span>, and 19 of the 60 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> had elevated ΔBLyS mRNA levels (P < 0.001). Levels of full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS mRNA strongly correlated with each other (r = 0.703; P < 0.001) in the SLE cohort, and plasma BLyS levels also correlated significantly with levels of each BLyS isoform (r = 0.429, P < 0.001; and r = 0.290, P = 0.024, respectively). Among these SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>, none of the measured BLyS parameters correlated with <span class="yellow">patient</span> age, sex, race, or daily dose of corticosteroids (data not shown). Because the racial composition of the normal cohort was not as predominantly Hispanic as were those of the RA and SLE cohorts, we assessed the BLyS parameters in the respective Hispanic subpopulations. As for the entire populations, values for SLE were significantly greater than those for either RA or normal controls (P ≤ 0.004; data not shown).<br><br>Correlations between BLyS parameters and plasma immunoglobulin levels
BLyS is a potent B cell survival factor [15-21], and administration of exogenous BLyS to <span class="blue">mice</span> leads to B cell expansion and hypergammaglobulinemia [1]. Previous studies with numbers of SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> greater than were included in the present study documented a modest but significant correlation between serum levels of BLyS and IgG [8,10]. In our SLE cohort of limited size, plasma BLyS levels failed to show significant correlations with plasma levels of total immunoglobulin, IgG, or IgA. In contrast, full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS mRNA levels correlated significantly with each (Figure 2). (None of the BLyS parameters correlated with plasma IgM levels.) The absence of significant correlation between plasma BLyS levels and the immunoglobulin parameters also persisted when just the 53 <span class="yellow">patients</span> with detectable plasma BLyS levels were considered (r = -0.133, P = 0.346 for total immunoglobulin; r = -0.048, P = 0.734 for IgG; and r = 0.033, P = 0.817 for IgA).<br><br>Correlations between BLyS parameters and disease activity
Previous studies either have failed to demonstrate a significant correlation between disease activity and circulating BLyS levels [7-9] or have detected only a weak correlation between the two [10]. Consonant with those studies, we identified no significant correlation between plasma BLyS levels and SLEDAI in our cohort of 60 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> (Figure 3a). The failure to demonstrate a significant correlation cannot be attributed to a skewing of the results by the <span class="yellow">patients</span> in whom plasma BLyS levels were below the limit of detection, because no significant correlation was detected among the 53 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> in whom plasma BLyS levels were in the detectable range (r = 0.185, P = 0.183). In contrast, a significant correlation between SLEDAI and full-length BLyS mRNA levels was readily discernible (Figure 3b). A trend toward a correlation between SLEDAI and ΔBLyS mRNA levels was also observed, although it did not achieve statistical significance (Figure 3c).
A component of the SLEDAI is the presence of circulating anti-dsDNA antibodies. Because circulating BLyS levels may affect the presence and/or titers of circulating anti-dsDNA antibodies [7-10], we assessed correlations between the individual BLyS parameters and a modified SLEDAI that excludes any consideration of anti-dsDNA antibodies. As with the unmodified SLEDAI, the modified SLEDAI did not correlate with plasma BLyS levels (Figure 3d) either among the SLE cohort overall or among the 53 <span class="yellow">patients</span> in whom plasma BLyS levels were in the detectable range (r = 0.160, P = 0.252), but it significantly correlated with full-length BLyS mRNA levels (Figure 3e) and exhibited a trend toward correlation with ΔBLyS mRNA levels (Figure 3f). Thus, the stronger correlations between BLyS mRNA levels and disease activity cannot solely be explained by any effects that BLyS may have on anti-dsDNA antibodies per se.
Moreover, among the 37 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> who were evaluated on two separate occasions, trends toward correlation were appreciated between changes in the unmodified or modified SLEDAI and changes in full-length BLyS or ΔBLyS mRNA levels but not changes in plasma BLyS levels (Figure 4). These results cannot be ascribed to changes in medications taken by the <span class="yellow">patients</span>, because changes in neither disease activity nor in any of the BLyS parameters correlated with changes in the doses of corticosteroids or cytotoxics taken by the <span class="yellow">patients</span> (data not shown). The failure to demonstrate a meaningful association between changes in SLEDAI score and changes in plasma BLyS protein levels cannot be attributed to a skewing of the results by the <span class="yellow">patients</span> in whom plasma BLyS levels were below the limit of detection, because the absence of association between the two persisted among the 27 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> in whom plasma BLyS levels were in the detectable range in both samples (r = -0.069, P = 0.727 for plasma BLyS versus unmodified SLEDAI; r = -0.020, P = 0.919 for plasma BLyS versus modified SLEDAI).<br><br>Lack of correlation between levels of BLyS mRNA isoforms and percentages of individual leukocyte cell types
Among cells in peripheral blood, BLyS is predominantly expressed by cells of the myeloid lineage (monocytes and neutrophils) [1,14,22,23]. Accordingly, a shift in the differential leukocyte count away from lymphocytes to monocytes and/or neutrophils could substantially alter BLyS mRNA results. Because of the limited amount of blood we were permitted to obtain from the SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> (consequent to the high prevalence of anemia among these <span class="yellow">patients</span>), we were unable to purify the individual leukocyte populations for BLyS mRNA analysis. Nevertheless, to demonstrate that the elevated BLyS mRNA levels in SLE did not simply reflect a shift in differential leukocyte count, we assessed the correlations between the individual BLyS parameters on the one hand and the percentages of blood neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes on the other. No correlations were appreciated (Figure 5).<br><br>Presence of anti-BLyS autoantibodies in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with systemic lupus erythematosus
The poorer correlation between plasma BLyS protein levels and disease activity compared with that between BLyS mRNA levels and disease activity was striking. <span class="yellow">Patients</span> with SLE frequently develop autoantibodies against self-antigens, and so some of the SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> might have harbored autoantibodies to BLyS. Such autoantibodies could have complexed with BLyS and enhanced its clearance, thereby masking BLyS overproduction. Alternatively, such autoantibodies might have sterically blocked the epitopes recognized by the detecting antibodies in the in vitro ELISA. In this case, measured BLyS levels would have been spuriously reduced, again masking BLyS overproduction.
In our cohort, IgA/IgM/IgG anti-BLyS antibodies were detected in six out of the 60 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>. Such autoantibodies were also detected in two out of 60 RA <span class="yellow">patients</span> and in one out of 30 normal control individuals, demonstrating that anti-BLyS autoantibodies are not restricted to SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>. IgG anti-BLyS autoantibodies were detected in 3 SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> but in no RA <span class="yellow">patients</span> or normal control individuals.<br><br>
Discussion
Elevated blood levels of BLyS protein and mRNA are well described features of <span class="yellow">human</span> SLE [7-9]. We confirmed these observations in our study and extended them by documenting increases not just in levels of full-length BLyS mRNA but also in levels of ΔBLyS mRNA (Figure 1). Of note, BLyS mRNA levels were elevated in SLE but not in RA, raising the possibility that BLyS overproduction in SLE is systemic whereas BLyS overproduction in RA may be more focused to the affected arthritic joints [24]. The modestly elevated plasma BLyS protein levels in RA <span class="yellow">patients</span> may reflect, at least in part, release of locally overproduced BLyS into the circulation.
The relationship between circulating BLyS protein levels and disease activity was addressed in several previous studies, but significant correlations between the two measures did not emerge [7-9]. In the largest study to date, a 2-year longitudinal study of 245 <span class="yellow">patients</span> in which more than 1,700 plasma samples were analyzed, a significant but weak correlation between the two was appreciated [10]. In the present study, a significant correlation between plasma BLyS protein levels and disease activity was again not realized (Figure 3a,d).
The weak, at best, correlation between circulating BLyS levels and disease activity is seemingly rather surprising. There is a clear-cut association in BlyS transgenic <span class="blue">mice</span> between BLyS overexpression and development of SLE-like features [3-5], and treatment of SLE-prone <span class="blue">mice</span> with BLyS antagonists retards the progression of disease and improves survival [3,6]. Moreover, development of precocious glomerular pathology in autoimmune-prone <span class="blue">mice</span> correlates strongly with circulating BLyS levels [25].
The likely explanation for the weak correlation between circulating BLyS levels and disease activity in <span class="yellow">human</span> SLE is not that disease activity in SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> is insensitive to the degree of BLyS overproduction. Rather, a more tenable explanation is that circulating BLyS levels in <span class="yellow">human</span> SLE do not always accurately reflect excessive endogenous BLyS production. We can identify at least three nonmutually exclusive mechanisms to explain a dissociation between the two.
First, SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> frequently develop autoantibodies to a myriad of self-targets (for example, erythrocytes, lymphocytes). Indeed, we detected circulating IgA/IgM/IgG anti-BLyS autoantibodies in 10% (6/60) of the tested SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>, and we detected circulating IgG anti-BLyS autoantibodies in 5% (3/60). These percentages may be underestimates of the true prevalence of anti-BLyS autoantibodies, because some of these autoantibodies may be saturated in vivo with circulating BLyS, rendering them incapable of binding to BLyS in the in vitro detection assay. We do not yet know whether the anti-BLyS autoantibodies are functionally neutralizing but, regardless, such autoantibodies could enhance the clearance of BLyS and/or interfere with in vitro detection of BLyS, thereby masking endogenous BLyS overproduction.
Second, increased urinary excretion of BLyS has been reported in SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>, especially among those with clinically overt renal involvement [26]. At least four of the <span class="yellow">patients</span> we studied manifested nephrotic-range proteinuria (≥3 g/24 hours), and so urinary loss of BLyS was probably substantial in at least these <span class="yellow">patients</span>. A validated assay for urinary BLyS detection has not yet been developed so we were unable to quantify urinary BLyS levels. Once an assay for urinary BLyS levels is validated, we should be able to assess the effect of urinary BLyS excretion on circulating BLyS levels.
Third, BLyS promotes in vivo expansion of B cells [1]. Freshly isolated SLE B cells, despite intact surface expression of BLyS receptors, bind less biotinylated BLyS ex vivo than do freshly isolated normal B cells [27]. Although other interpretations are possible, the most likely explanation is that BLyS receptors on B cells in SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> are occupied in vivo by soluble BLyS. Accordingly, it is likely that BLyS receptors expressed by the expanded B cell population do bind BLyS and remove it from the circulation, resulting in a homeostatic pathway that modulates the effects of BLyS overproduction on circulating BLyS levels. Indeed, circulating levels of BLyS rise with peripheral blood B cell depletion and fall with re-emergence of peripheral blood B cells in rituximab-treated RA or SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> [28,29], highlighting this inverse relationship between circulating BLyS levels and B cell load. Moreover, one of the hallmarks of active disease in <span class="yellow">human</span> SLE is the increased percentages of activated B cells and plasma cells in peripheral blood [30-34], probably reflecting increased systemic numbers of activated B cells and plasma cells. Although not yet formally tested, differential BLyS receptor expression by these cells compared with expression by nonactivated B cells may result in increased peripheral BLyS utilization, further dampening the effects of BLyS overproduction on circulating protein levels.
To circumvent these confounding processes, we used BLyS mRNA levels as a surrogate marker of endogenous BLyS production. Overall, the correlations between disease activity and either full-length BLyS or ΔBLyS mRNA levels were much stronger than that between disease activity and BLyS protein levels (Figures 3 and 4). This was the case regardless of whether we used the standard SLEDAI or the modified SLEDAI as a measure of disease activity. These correlations were not spurious ones consequent to shifts in percentages of leukocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood, because BLyS mRNA levels did not correlate with percentages of blood neutrophils, monocytes, or lymphocytes (Figure 5).
A similar pattern was observed between plasma immunoglobulin levels and the BLyS parameters, with plasma levels of total immunoglobulin, IgG, and IgA correlating significantly with full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS mRNA levels but not with plasma BLyS levels (Figure 2). These significant correlations between full-length BLyS or ΔBLyS mRNA levels and plasma immunoglobulin levels again highlight the greater ability of BLyS mRNA levels, compared with plasma BLyS protein levels, to reflect ongoing BLyS overproduction.
At present, it is not known whether soluble ΔBLyS protein is present in the circulation of SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> or of normal individuals. Although full-length BLyS protein is readily cleaved and released from cells transfected with a vector containing <span class="yellow">murine</span> full-length BLyS, ΔBLyS protein is not cleaved or released from <span class="yellow">murine</span> ΔBLyS transfectants [11]. Given the strong similarities between <span class="yellow">murine</span> and <span class="yellow">human</span> full-length BLyS and ΔBLyS, it is likely that <span class="yellow">human</span> soluble ΔBLyS protein is also not cleaved from the cell surface and released into the circulation. Moreover, soluble ΔBLyS protein is not released from cells transfected with a vector containing just the extracellular domain of <span class="yellow">human</span> ΔBLyS (which encodes the soluble protein; A.L. Gavin, unpublished observations). Whether this reflects rapid intracellular degradation of soluble ΔBLyS or some other impediment to its release remains unknown. Regardless, if the inability to release soluble ΔBLyS in vitro faithfully recapitulates in vivo biology, then the stronger associations between SLE disease activity and full-length BLyS or ΔBLyS mRNA levels compared with that between SLE disease activity and BLyS protein levels could not be attributable to interference by biologically inactive (inhibitory) ΔBLyS protein in the BLyS protein detection ELISA. Importantly, even if soluble ΔBLyS protein is present in the circulation and is detected by the BLyS protein detection ELISA, then the stronger correlations between SLE disease activity and full-length BLyS or ΔBLyS mRNA levels than that between disease activity and total BLyS (including ΔBLyS) protein levels suggest that full-length BLyS and/or ΔBLyS mRNA levels may operationally serve as useful biomarkers of disease activity in SLE. Although the complexity and labor intensiveness associated with quantitative real-time PCR may render measurement of BLyS mRNA levels impracticable for routine clinical practice, such measurement could readily be incorporated into clinical trials and yield valuable information.
Longitudinal observations in large numbers of SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> will be necessary to establish or refute the utility of full-length BLyS and/or ΔBLyS mRNA to subserve this clinically vital function.
Although expression of the two major BLyS isoforms was highly coordinate among SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>, there were several <span class="yellow">patients</span> in whom ΔBLyS mRNA levels were markedly greater than or less than the expected values based on full-length BLyS mRNA levels (data not shown). This raises the possibility that dysregulation of ΔBLyS may contribute to overall BLyS dysregulation in at least some SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>. It is known that interferon-γ, interleukin-10, interferon-α, and CD154 can upregulate full-length BLyS mRNA levels [14,22,35], but it is not known what effects these or other cytokines/cell-surface structures have on ΔBLyS expression. Further investigation of the regulation of ΔBLyS and the differential expression of BLyS isoforms is certainly warranted.
Although the associations between full-length BLyS and/or ΔBLyS mRNA levels and disease activity in SLE were usually strong when the SLE cohort was analyzed in aggregate, there were several SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> in whom BLyS mRNA levels were quite high despite little objective ongoing disease activity, and there were several SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> in whom BLyS mRNA levels were low despite considerable ongoing disease activity. One must recognize that the bulk of the pathogenic autoimmune responses probably takes place in the spleen and lymph nodes, rather than in the peripheral blood, where myeloid lineage cells (for example, dendritic cells) produce BLyS and support B cell survival and expansion [36]. Local BLyS production in the secondary lymphoid tissues will be more important to the development and maintenance of an autoimmune response than will remote BLyS levels in the circulation. Because at least some autoreactive B cells may be more sensitive to BLyS-mediated survival signals than non-autoreactive B cells [37,38], local increases in BLyS production could preferentially promote expansion of autoreactive B cells. These cells, in turn, could activate autoreactive T cells by presenting autoantigen to them, and some of the autoreactive B cells would respond to T cell derived signals and mature into (pathogenic) autoantibody secreting plasma cells. In contrast to <span class="yellow">murine</span> studies, in which investigators can readily harvest and analyze lymphoid and myeloid lineage cells from any site (for example, spleen, bone marrow), such is not the case for <span class="yellow">human</span> studies. Peripheral blood is the only site readily accessible for <span class="yellow">human</span> studies, and it is possible that, at least in some <span class="yellow">patients</span>, BLyS mRNA levels in circulating leukocytes do not reflect local BLyS production in the secondary lymphoid tissues.
One must also recognize that disease activity in SLE is not solely driven by B cells. Systemic inflammation and SLE flares can be triggered via B cell independent means. Not all SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> treated with a B cell depleting course of rituximab experience clinical remission [39], strongly pointing to the importance of non-B cells in disease pathogenesis/maintenance. Conversely, not all pathogenic B cells necessarily require high levels of BLyS to effect their pathogenicity. <span class="yellow">Murine</span> studies have unequivocally documented B cell subpopulations that do not depend upon BLyS for their survival [40-42]. Although <span class="blue">mice</span> completely devoid of BLyS have reduced numbers of mature B cells and harbor reduced levels of immunoglobulin, these reductions are incomplete. Thus, it is possible that some SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> harbor pathogenic B cells that are relatively insensitive to BLyS and could drive considerable disease activity even in the context of low endogenous BLyS production. Conversely, <span class="yellow">patients</span> with high BLyS mRNA levels may be those <span class="yellow">patients</span> whose disease is strongly driven by BLyS and may be especially helped by BLyS antagonist therapy. Future clinical trials should be able to establish whether the BLyS mRNA levels are good predictors of response to such agents.<br><br>Conclusion
Plasma total immunoglobulin, IgG, and IgA levels and disease activity (as measured by SLEDAI) in SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span> correlate more closely with peripheral blood leukocyte levels of BLyS mRNA than with plasma levels of BLyS protein. These findings suggest that BLyS mRNA levels better reflect in vivo BLyS production than do circulating BLyS protein levels, and may be a useful biomarker in the clinical monitoring of SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>. These findings also support the premise that BLyS overexpression not only promotes development of disease but also actively contributes to the ongoing maintenance of disease in SLE <span class="yellow">patients</span>. This reinforces the rationale underlying clinical trials with BLyS antagonists in SLE.<br><br>Abbreviations

<h3>pmcA2365769</h3>IL-5 drives eosinophils from bone marrow to blood and tissues in a <span class="yellow">guinea-pig</span> model of visceral larva migrans syndrome
Abstract
This study was undertaken to evaluate the role of IL-5 in eosinophil migration and in the maintenance of eosinophilia in a <span class="yellow">guinea-pig</span> model of visceral larva migrans syndrome. The results show that the infection of animals with <span class="yellow">Toxocara canis</span> induced an early increase in serum IL-5 levels that might be essential for eosinophil differentiation and proliferation and for the development of eosinophilia. When infected <span class="yellow">guinea-pigs</span> were treated with mAb anti-IL-5 (TRFK-5) given at the same time or 1 or 3 days after infection, there was a high percentage of reduction of eosinophil counts 18 days after infection. However, when the mAb was administered during the peak of eosinophilia, there was high inhibition in blood, no inhibition in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) or peritoneum and an increase in eosinophil numbers in bone marrow. Thus, a basic level of IL-5 may be essential to drive eosinophils from bone marrow to blood and tissues, and for the maintenance of eosinophilia in infected animals. We may also conclude that when eosinophils have already migrated to the lungs, TRFK-5 has no power to inhibit eosinophilia, which is also under control of local lung cells producing IL-5. In this way, only one later TRFK-5 treatment may not be sufficient to modify the lung parenchyma microenvironment, since <span class="yellow">T. canis</span> antigens had already stimulated some cell populations to produce IL-5.

In <span class="yellow">humans</span>, VLMS results from the ingestion of embryonated eggs of <span class="yellow">T. canis</span>, that eclode in the small intesfine. The infective larvae invade the mucosa, move into the liver via the portal circulation, and from there to the lungs. 2 Beaver et al., 3 who were the first to describe this syndrome, noted the intense eosinophilia which reaches more than 90% of total leucocyte counts. However, there are few studies regarding the mechanisms involved in the blood and tissue eosinophilia obseeeed in VLMS. Several investigators have suggested a direct correlation between eosinophilia and interleukin5 (IL-5) in <span class="yellow">human</span> helminth infections4'5 and in experimental animal models. 67 Inhibition of eosinophilia has been demonstrated by anti-IL-5 24 Mediators of Inflammation Vol 5 <br><br> brasiliensis, 8 $chistosoma mansoni, <span class="yellow">Toxocara canis</span>7 and <span class="yellow">Heligmosomoidespolygyrus</span>. 1 IL-5 has also been shown to support the terminal differentiation, proliferation of eosinophil precursors 11'12 and eosinophil activation. 13 Although IL-5 does not demonstrate eosinophil chemotactic activity in vivo14 there is some evidence suggesting that this cytokine may modulate a selective eosinophil accumulation at the site of inflammation. Moreover, Sehmi et a/.15 reported that IL-5 has a selective priming effect on eosinophil migratory response to nonselective chemoattractant mediators in vitro. Also, Moser et a/. 16 have demonstrated that in order to acquire the ability to transmigrate, eosinophils must be primed with IL-5, IL-3 and GM-CSF. Thus, the involvement of IL-5 in eosinophilia is not fully understood. In the present study we have used a <span class="yellow">guinea-pig</span> model of VLMS to investigate the involvement of IL-5 in eosinophil migration and in the maintenance of eosinophilia in blood, bone marrow, lung and peritoneal cavity.

Determination oflL-5 in serum: The IL-5 level in the serum of <span class="yellow">guinea-pigs</span> was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Briefly, ELISA plates (96-well Immunoplate MaxiSorp, Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with IL-5-specific monoclonal antibody (TRFK-5, 5 lag/ml in phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4, PBS, 100 l.tl/well). After 2 h of incubation at 37C, the wells were washed four times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T). Then, 100 btl of samples or recombinant <span class="yellow">murine</span> IL-5 standards (0.15-200ng/ml) in PBS-T and 2% BSA (PBSTBSA) were added to each well. After incubation for l h at 37C, the wells were washed three times and 100 l.tl of biotinylated <span class="yellow">rat</span> anti-<span class="yellow">murine</span> IL-5 (biotinylated-TRFK-5, 1 lag/ml in PBS-TBSA) was added. After incubation for 1 h at 37C, the wells were washed again three times and 100 of peroxidase-labelled streptavidin (1/1000, Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories Inc., Maryland, USA) were added to each well. Following incubation for l h at 37C and further washing, the enzyme was developed using the TMB substrate peroxidase for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 501.tl of 2.0 N HCl, and the optical densities were read at 490nm using an automated plate reader. The sensitivity of the assay was 0.15 ng/ml and the upper limit 100ng/ml. <br><br> the animal house of Ribeiro Preto, Uni<br><br> Infection of animals: <span class="yellow">T. canis</span> eggs were obtained by the methods of Olson and Schulz, 17 with minor modifications.

Data obtained from five animals. <br><br> drastically reduced, even when determined 18 days after infection (Table 1). No inhibition of eosinophil counts was observed when the animals were inoculated with the irrelevant antibody at the time of infection (Table 1). Fig. 4 shows the comparative results of eosinophilia obtained when the antibody was given 3 days or 17 days after egg inoculation. The antibody given at 3 days after infection induced a high percentage of inhibition in eosinophil counts in all the compartments analysed 18 days after infection (Fig. 4A). However, when TRFK-5 was administered to the infected animals on day 17 post-infection (thus 1 day before sacrifice), a significant inhibition in number and percentage of eosinophils was observed only in the blood (p=0.030) (Fig. 4B). A small non-significant decrease was seen in BALF (p 0.790) and peritoneum (p= 0.222). Moreover, the number of mature eosinophils in bone marrow increased by 140% (p 0.038). As demonstrated in Fig. 4B, the behaviour of eosinotShilia in BALF was completely different from that observed in blood. Thus, to better understand the eosinophilia in the lungs of infected animals, we monitored eosinophil numbers in BALF after administration of TRFK-5 at the same time, or 1, 3, 12 or 17 days after infection. The animals were sacrificed 18 days after infection. In another group, TRFK-5 was administered 18 days post-infection and the animals were sacrificed 6 days later. When the mAb was administered at the same time or 1 or 3 days postinfection there was a significant inhibition in the number of eosinophils (Fig. 5).

Thus, the histological determination of eosinophil infiltration in these lungs corroborates a reduction but not a sizeable inhibition of eosinophil numbers as observed in the BALF of the same infected animals, <br><br> poorly defined, although T lymphocytes and mast cells appear to be involved in eosinophilia. 9'2 IL-5, a T cell-derived factor that regulates B cell functions, is an eosinophil differentiation factor11 as well as a stimulating and survival-prolonging factor specific for eosinophils in vitro. 2 Also, several investigators have demonstrated that sTstemic eosinophilia in <span class="blue">mice</span> infected with parasites is mediated by IL-5 produced in response to the infection. 2'22 In the present study, the i.p. administration of the TRFK-5 antibody markedly inhibited the widespread eosinophilia observed in <span class="yellow">T. canis</span>-infected <span class="yellow">guinea-pigs</span>, indicating that IL5 participated in a <span class="yellow">guinea-pig</span> model of VLMS eosinophJlia. Most of the <span class="yellow">T. canis</span> larvae which penetrated the intestinal wall had migrated into the liver within 72h after inoculation as demonstrated here and elsewhere. 2 It is apparently during this interval that the worm provides the signals to cytokine-producing cells, which in turn trigger increased serum levels of specific cytokine as demonstrated here for IL-5, 24 to 72 h after infection. The signals may be provided directly by the invading parasite or by cells in response to the parasite. The cytokine pattern that develops at this early stage, probably induced by a T-cell independent pathway, may also influence the pattern of T cell differentiation into a Th2 type, which may be responsible for the second peak of IL-5 observed in our experimental model (Fig. 3), although a second cycle of larval invasion (Fig. 2) with a rapid peak of IL-5 liberation cannot be ruled out. <br><br> Discussion The results of the present study show that in our experimental model widespread eosinophilia follows the infection of <span class="yellow">guinea-pigs</span> with second stage eggs from <span class="yellow">T. canis</span>, as also noted in <span class="yellow">humans</span> and in other experimental animals. 7'7 <span class="yellow">T. canis</span> is a potent stimulus for systemic eosinophilia, since blood, BALF, peritoneum and all tissues examined (kidney, eyes, spleen, thymus, <br><br> Thus, our results suggest that the eosinophilia against helminth larvae may be initiated by the release of IL-5 when the parasites migrate from the intestine to the liver by stimulation of specific cell populations. Then, an early release of IL-5 quickly induces eosinophil recruitment, probably first from the stored mature eosinophil pool from vascular endothelium or by the mobilization of eosinophils from extravascular sites to the blood. This fact could explain why we found increased eosinophils first in blood and later in other compartments. The early IL-5 release may also serve as a signal for eosinophil differentiation and maturation in bone marrow. The time <br><br> inteeeal observed between the first peak of IL-5 release and the increase of eosinophils in blood coincides with that reported to be necessary for eosinophil differentiation and maturation in vitro. 12Increased eosinophil production and liberation into blood and other tissues occurs Mediators of Inflammation Vol 5 <br><br> 1996 <br><br> 29 <br><br> L.

Thus, early and later IL-5 release provides a necessary level of this cytokine, which is involved in the maintenance of eosinophilia. We may assume that the inhibition of the first peak of IL-5 release by TRFK-5 does not permit the subsequent T cell stimulation and differentiation. This may explain the long-lasting effect of TRFK5 treatment observed here and also reported by others. 8 In agreement with our results, there is an important observation of Svetic et al. 24 showing that a specific and highly reproducible IL-5 gene expression pattern is detectable in Peyer's patches by 6 to 12h after <span class="yellow">Heligmosomoides polygyrus</span> infection. The early increase in IL-5 gene expression after infection was probably T cell-independent, inasmuch as it was obseeeed in Peyer's patches of congenitally athymic <span class="blue">mice</span> and of conventional <span class="blue">mice</span> treated with anti-CD4 30 Mediators of Inflammation Vol 5 <br><br> and anti-CD8 mAb. Moreover, Kusama eta/. 25 have observed two peaks of eosinophilia in normal and athymic <span class="blue">mice</span>, and suggested that IL-5 observed in the first peak was produced by cells other than CD4 T cells, since anti-CD4 and anti-CD3 mAb reduced only the second peak of eosinophilia in normal <span class="blue">mice</span> and slightly reduced the first peak of eosinophilia in both normal and nu/nu <span class="blue">mice</span>. The local lung cells producing IL-5 may also help us to explain the reason why 12, 17 or 18 days post-infection TRFK-5 treatment only partially inhibits, or does not inhibit eosinophil infiltration into the lungs, as demonstrated in Figs 5 and 6. We may suggest that when eosinophils have already migrated to the lungs, TRFK-5 has no power to inhibit eosinophilia, which is also under control of local lung cells producing IL-5.

One of the most important results obtained here was the inhibition of circulating eosinophil numbers by the different mAb treatments, even when the antibody was given at the peak of blood eosinophilia, which was accompanied by an increase of mature eosinophils in bone marrow. This suggests that IL-5, apart from being required for the terminal differentiation of eosinophils in bone marrow, 26 is also likely to drive eosinophils from the bone marrow to the blood and then to the tissues, probably by upregulating VLA-4 expression in eosinophils. Moser et aL have demonstrated that in order to acquire the ability to transmigrate, eosinophils must be primed with cytokines such as IL-5, IL-3 or GM-CSF for expression of adhesion molecules such as VI-4.

Abstract
The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is separated from the photoreceptor outer segments by the subretinal space. While the actual volume of this space is minimal, the communication that occurs across this microenvironment is important to the visual process, and accumulating evidence suggests the purines ATP and adenosine contribute to this communication. P1 and P2 receptors are localized to membranes on both the photoreceptor outer segments and on the apical membrane of the RPE which border subretinal space. ATP is released across the apical membrane of the RPE into this space in response to various triggers including glutamate and chemical ischemia. This ATP is dephosphorylated into adenosine by a series of ectoenzymes on the RPE apical membrane. Regulation of release and ectoenzyme activity in response to light-sensitive signals can alter the balance of purines in subretinal space, and thus coordinate communication across subretinal space with the visual process.<br><br>Introduction
The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) lies between the outer segments of the photoreceptors and the choroidal blood supply (Fig. 1). The RPE combines the functions of epithelial and glial cells, providing a barrier while also supporting the neural photoreceptors and modulating their function. Tight communication between photoreceptors and the RPE is critical to coordinate the multiple levels of interaction, and the purinergic contribution to this communication is becoming apparent. The relevance of this purinergic input is emphasized by the many functional effects of P1 and P2 receptor stimulation and by the multiple mechanisms in place to regulate subretinal levels of purine agonists. As the dynamics of ATP release and extracellular conversion into adenosine will modify agonist availability, the modulation of these processes can exert a temporal control on purinergic signaling. The following review will outline the main interactions between the RPE and photoreceptors, describe the effects of stimulating purinergic receptors on both sides of subretinal space, and summarize how levels of ATP, ADP, and adenosine are manipulated in this microenvironment.
Fig. 1Schematic illustration of the key components of purinergic signaling in the subretinal microenvironment. Stimulation of P2 receptors on the RPE can enhance transepithelial fluid absorption while P1 receptors can modulate phagocytosis. ATP released through CFTR and other Cl− channels can stimulate P2 receptors or be converted to ADP, AMP, and adenosine (Ado) by a series of ectonucleotidases present on the apical membrane of the RPE. By controlling the balance of extracellular purines available to stimulate these receptors these mechanisms can control levels of endogenous purines available to activate the receptors. While theoretically possible, it remains to be determined whether these subretinal purines can actually stimulate photoreceptors
Purines and subretinal space
RPE-photoreceptor interactions across the subretinal space
The outer segments of the rods and cones are responsible for the initial stages of vision, converting photon energy into a series of enzymatic reactions that close the light-sensitive channels on the photoreceptor plasma membrane, hyperpolarize the cells, and reduce the release of glutamate from the synaptic terminals [1, 2]. Efficient photoreceptor function depends upon both short-term and long-term support from the RPE. The critical nature of these interactions is evident from the rapid degeneration of photoreceptors in the absence of a healthy RPE layer and by the RPE localization of defective gene product in some forms of hereditary photoreceptor degeneration [3].
The apical membrane of the RPE is separated from the plasma membrane of the outer segments by an extracellular space of only 10–20 nm [4]. Although small, this subretinal space contains a highly structured matrix which ensheathes the outer segments and extends to the RPE [5, 6]. The presence of enzymes within this interphotoreceptor matrix emphasizes that this extracellular space itself is functionally active [7, 8]. This intimate anatomical relationship between photoreceptors and the RPE reflects multiple functional interactions. For example, the RPE accepts, recycles, and exports central components of the phototransduction process [9]. The outer segments are continuously resynthesized, and the phagocytosis, degradation, and processing of shed outer segment tips by the RPE cells is central to this renewal [10]. The ion channels and transporters on the apical membrane of the RPE help regulate the ionic composition of the subretinal space [11]. As extracellular levels of ions can modify the ionic driving forces across the photoreceptor plasma membrane, these RPE transporters can influence the state of neural activity. The transport of fluid and ions from the apical membrane to basolateral membrane of the RPE is also one of the main forces keeping the retina attached [12].
The control of photoreceptor activity by light gives a rapid temporal dependence to some interactions between the photoreceptors and the RPE. The volume of subretinal space increases in response to light [13], linking small changes in the ionic composition of the subretinal space with activity of the RPE transport mechanisms which maintain this volume [14, 15]. Other processes are controlled on a diurnal cycle. The shed tips of the outer segments are phagocytosed by the RPE soon after the onset of light [16, 17]. These processes can both be modulated by purine levels in subretinal space, indicating purinergic regulation is important over multiple time scales.<br><br>Purinergic receptors on photoreceptors
A2 adenosine receptors were localized to both the inner and outer segments of photoreceptor outer segments over a decade ago by Blazynski and colleagues [18], with more recent reports emphasizing their functional role. A2 agonists inhibit the L-type Ca2+ channel on rod outer segments [19] and can inhibit the synaptic release of glutamate from rods, suggesting changes in adenosine levels in subretinal space could modulate light sensitivity [20]. The A2 agonist DPMA and the adenosine deaminase inhibitor EHNA reduce mRNA for opsin in rods, suggesting that endogenous levels of adenosine can downregulate opsin message at night [21]. EHNA and the A2A receptor agonist CGS21680 also increase the survival of <span class="yellow">chick</span> embryonic photoreceptors in culture [22], indicating a long-term neuroprotective role for adenosine.
P2 receptors are also present in the photoreceptors. mRNA for the P2X2 receptor is expressed in the photoreceptor cell bodies, with immunohistochemical localization of the protein to outer segments [23]. In situ hybridization indicates the photoreceptor layer has the highest level of P2Y2 receptor of any region in the <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> retina, although staining was not pronounced in monkey [24]. P2X7 receptors have recently been localized to photoreceptor synaptic terminals, with evidence for ecto-ATPase activity in the synapse, and functional evidence suggesting ATP augments transmission of the light response by rods [25]. It was suggested that ATP might be co-released from photoreceptors with glutamate, although this remains to be tested directly.<br><br>Purinergic receptors on the RPE
Stimulation of P1 receptors can have a considerable impact on RPE cells. A2 receptors have been recognized on cultured and fresh RPE cells for some time [26, 27], with in situ hybridization confirming the presence of A2A receptors in <span class="yellow">rat</span> RPE [28]. Stimulation of A2 receptors reduces the rate of rod outer segment phagocytosis by RPE cells [29], while application of adenosine to the apical membrane of <span class="yellow">chick</span> RPE cells increases the basolateral Cl- conductance, the transepithelial potential, and the c-wave, and decreases the hyperpolarization of the basal membrane in response to light [30]. Although adenosine alone does not increase intracellular Ca2+ levels [31], adenosine acts synergistically with ATP to elevate Ca2+ levels in <span class="yellow">human</span> RPE cells by stimulating both A1 and A2A receptors [32, 33]. Stimulation of A1 receptors with high doses of NECA increases the active transport of fluorescein across the RPE, while activation of A2A receptors decreases this transport, and by extension, transport of the ions that underlie fluid movement [34]. Stimulation of A1 and A2A receptors produces analogous increases and decreases, respectively, in the absorption of subretinal fluid blebs. This is consistent with the negative coupling of the A1 receptor and the positive coupling of the A2 receptors to adenylate cyclase, as increasing cAMP inhibits the transport of fluid across the RPE towards the choroid [35–37]. The agonist 2-Cl adenosine reverses the deficit in phosphoinositide metabolism found in diabetic RPE cells [38], suggesting effects on metabolism in addition to transport and phagocytosis.
Multiple P2 receptors have been localized to the RPE. The P2Y2 receptor was initially characterized in cultured <span class="yellow">human</span> RPE [31], with subsequent reports localizing transcript for P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, and P2Y6 in the <span class="yellow">rat</span> RPE/choroid [39] and for P2Y1 and P2Y12 receptors in ARPE-19 cells [40], and functionally identifying a P2X receptor in <span class="yellow">rat</span> RPE cells [41]. ATP, ADP, and UTP induce numerous effects on RPE physiology [32, 33, 42, 43]. While these effects likely involve multiple different receptor types, the contributions of the P2Y2 receptor have been explored in most detail to date. The P2Y2 receptor has been specifically localized to the apical membrane of fresh <span class="yellow">bovine</span> RPE cells, and addition of ATP to this membrane transiently elevates Ca2+, activates a basolateral Cl- conductance, inhibits an apical K+ conductance, and increases the apical to basolateral flow of fluid [43]. This increased absorption of fluid from the subretinal space suggests P2Y2 receptor stimulation could reduce the excess fluid that accumulates in retinal edemas, and several reports have supported this theory. ATP, UTP, and the P2Y2 receptor agonist INS37217 decrease the size of subretinal fluid blebs when injected into subretinal space of <span class="yellow">rats</span> [44]. In both normal and rds +/- <span class="blue">mice</span> with experimentally induced detachment, INS31217 improves the ERG recovery and decreased cell death [45]. INS37217 also reduces subretinal blebs in <span class="yellow">rabbits</span> [46]. Injection of another P2Y2 agonist, INS542, increases the active transport of fluorescein across the RPE, consistent with this upregulation of ion and fluid transport across the tissue [47]. Together these experiments emphasize the clinical potential of treating retinal edema with P2Y2 agonists.<br><br>
Regulation of purine levels in subretinal space
While synthesized purinergic agonists may prove useful in treating some ocular disorders, the endogenous activation of P1 and P2 receptors in the subretinal microenvironment will ultimately be determined by availability of agonists. These levels are largely controlled by the release of ATP into the subretinal space, its conversion into other purines including adenosine, and the manipulation of adenosine by enzymes or transporters. Recent work has increased our understanding of both the stimuli that initiate changes in subretinal purine levels and the mechanisms that mediate these changes.
Release of ATP by the RPE
At least some of the ATP capable of stimulating the purinergic receptors on RPE cells is released from the RPE itself. The resulting autocrine stimulation ensures local delivery, and control, of purines to initiate the physiologic changes in the RPE. The release of ATP by RPE cells is triggered by multiple stimuli including osmotic stress, bFGF, UTP, NMDA, glutamate, and ATP [39, 40, 48–51]. The ATP release following activation of NMDA receptors by glutamate may have the most interesting implications for communication across subretinal space, given that glutamate confers the light signal from photoreceptors to the rest of the visual system. Glutamate and the specific receptor agonist NMDA triggers ATP release from ARPE-19 cells, with the release inhibited by NMDA antagonist MK-801, and by DCKA, which inhibits the glycine B binding site on NMDA receptors [51, 52]. Although NMDA raises intracellular Ca2+ levels, this increase is prevented by eliminating ATP with apyrase, indicating autostimulation through released ATP is responsible for this Ca2+ signal. NMDA also triggers a release of ATP when applied to the intact <span class="yellow">bovine</span> RPE eyecup [51]. The NMDA receptors and the ATP release sites have been functionally identified to the apical membrane of the <span class="yellow">bovine</span> RPE, suggesting the neurotransmitter interactions could amplify the signal from any glutamate reaching subretinal space.
The ability of both UTP and ATP to stimulate release of ATP from the RPE supports the theory that the system acts to amplify signals. When applied at greater than 1 μM, ATP triggers a secondary release of ATP peaking 10 min after the initial stimuli [40]. UTP also initiates a release in extracellular ATP with a similar delay [48]. The rise in ATP triggered by UTP is inhibited by the Cl- channel blocker NPPB, and UDP is much less effective at triggering release than UTP; both observations suggest the P2Y2 receptor contributes to the increase in ATP more than diphosphokinase, although influence from the enzyme cannot be ruled out [53].
Recent evidence suggests that ischemia may lead to the release of ATP from RPE cells. Chemical ischemia triggers a substantial ATP release from cardiac myocytes [54], while changes in oxygen levels trigger ATP release in central chemoreceptors [55]. We found that exposure to sodium cyanide led to a rapid release of ATP from ARPE-19 cells (Fig. 2). As hypoxic and/or ischemic challenge may lead to changes in the expression of growth factors in RPE cells during certain ocular disorders such as macular degeneration [56], and as purines can induce expression of VEGF in other cells [57], this ATP release may contribute to growth factor signaling by the diseased RPE.
Fig. 2Chemical ischemia triggers ATP release from ARPE-19 cells. ATP release was measured in the bath directly from cells plated in 96-well plates to which the luciferin- luciferase reaction mixture was added [51]. Left Levels of ATP in the bath after addition of 5 mM NaCN to the cells. Measurement began 1 min after addition of NaCN or control solution to wells. Right Levels of ATP measured at the peak, 3 min after addition of NaCN (n = 12). Levels were normalized to concurrent levels in control (n = 14). Symbols and bars represent mean ± SE, *p < 0.001
The particular conduit for ATP release varies with the stimuli. The release in response to hypotonic challenge is largely dependent upon CFTR, as it was prevented by the specific CFTR inhibitor CFTR172 in addition to the more general blocker glybenclamide [50]. While the precise mechanisms by which CFTR contributes to this release are not yet known, a role for CFTR in ATP release into subretinal space is consistent with the reduction of certain ERG components in cftr -/- <span class="blue">mice</span> [58] and with the ability of apical ATP to activate conductances associated with these ERG components [43]. The release of ATP is also largely blocked by the vesicular transport inhibitor brefeldin A, suggesting the two processes occurred in series whereby ATP efflux follows the insertion of vesicles containing CFTR into the plasma membrane. Although the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA blocks this ATP release [50], raising Ca2+ alone with ionophore ionomycin does not itself initiate release [48]. This necessary but not sufficient contribution of Ca2+ also supports a role for vesicular insertion.
In contrast to the release following hypotonic challenge, the ATP release in response to NMDA does not involve CFTR [51]. Release is blocked by NPPB, however, suggesting another type of anion channel could serve as a conduit for ATP release. The presence of parallel mechanisms coexisting on the same cell for ATP release triggered by either agonists or by cell swelling has also been reported in astrocytes [59] and may reflect the multiple roles of purinergic signaling within a given tissue. As both stimuli lead to release across the apical membrane into subretinal space, both are expected to influence signaling in the microenvironment.<br><br>Interconversion of purines in subretinal space
The interconversion of nucleotides and nucleosides each capable of stimulating distinct receptors makes the purinergic signaling system of particular interest in a confined region such as the subretinal space. The main enzymes responsible for dephosphorylating extracellular ATP on the RPE cells have been analyzed and a basic understanding of their regulation has begun. This section first describes the enzymes that act on ATP and ADP, followed by enzymes which convert AMP into adenosine.
The dephosphorylation of extracellular ATP by RPE cells involves enzymes from multiple families [40], as found in airway epithelial cells [60]. Degradation of ATP by the apical membrane of the fresh <span class="yellow">bovine</span> eyecup and by ARPE-19 cells is inhibited by ARL67156 or βγmATP. Message for eNPP1, eNPP2, and eNPP3 is present in ARPE-19 cells, consistent with the preference of βγmATP for members of the eNPP family [61]. The cells also express NTPDase2, and NTPDase3, although the intermittent presence of NTPDase1 likely reflects a regulated process [40]. Ecto-alkaline phosphatase has no effect on ATP degradation in RPE cells, in contrast to its considerable contribution in airway epithelium [62]. The putative contribution from diphosphokinases to interconversion of subretinal purines is presently unknown.
Extracellular AMP is rapidly dephosphorylated into adenosine in subretinal space. The production of adenosine from ATP at the apical membrane of the <span class="yellow">bovine</span> RPE eyecup is inhibited by the ecto-5′-nucleotidase inhibitor αβmADP, confirming a role for this enzyme [63]. The enzyme is localized to <span class="yellow">rat</span> RPE and ARPE-19 cells immunohistochemically. Degradation of 5′AMP is highest near the subretinal space of <span class="yellow">rat</span> retina [63], although localization in <span class="yellow">mouse</span> indicated larger amounts of ecto-5′-nucleotidase at the tips of adjacent Müller cells [64]. Levamisole does not inhibit the dephosphorylation of 5′AMP by the RPE, consistent with the absence of substantial ecto-alkaline phosphatase in subretinal space.
The presence of light may alter the levels of adenosine in subretinal space. Epinephrine is released at the onset of light [65] and stimulation of the RPE with epinephrine can decrease activity of ecto-5′-nucleotidase [63]. While norepinephrine and phenylephrine lead to similar decreases in enzyme activity, prazosin and corynanthine block the effects of norepinephrine, implicating the α1 epinephrine receptor in the inhibition of ecto-5′-nucleotidase [63]. The kinetics of inhibition are consistent with cleavage of the nucleotidase from its GPI anchor. The phagocytosis of rod outer segments is maximal shortly after light onset [16], and this phagocytosis is inhibited by adenosine [29]. The ability of epinephrine released by the illuminated retina to reduce ecto-5′-nucleotidase activity and consequently adenosine levels may relieve this inhibition and enhance the rate of phagocytosis at light onset.<br><br>
Physiologic effects of subretinal purines on the RPE and photoreceptors
The number of purinergic receptors on both photoreceptor and RPE membranes suggests purines make multiple contributions to the physiology of the outer retina. Our increased understanding of how agonist levels in subretinal space are controlled has begun to indicate how and when this contribution may occur. Future research will involve applying these findings from isolated systems to intact RPE-photoreceptor models, and pursuing the role of defective purinergic regulation in ocular disease. While it is unlikely that ATP released across the apical membrane of the RPE can diffuse to these P2 receptors in the outer plexiform layer given the ecto-ATPase activity in the synaptic clef [25], stimulation of receptors elsewhere on the photoreceptor membrane is possible. It would be interesting to determine whether ATP released from the RPE and converted to adenosine by ecto-nucleotidases can actually modulate the response to light by stimulating the A2A receptors on photoreceptor outer segments. The impact of purinergic signaling on chronic ocular diseases is also of interest, such as the role of ischemia-driven ATP release in VEGF production. While the small size of subretinal space can complicate pharmacologic manipulation within the intact RPE-photoreceptor complex, molecular approaches may provide new insight into how endogenous purines in subretinal space affect the physiology, and pathophysiology, of both RPE and photoreceptors.<br><br><br><br><h3>pmcA2430230</h3>Emergence of Delayed Methylmercury Toxicity after Perinatal Exposure in Metallothionein-Null and Wild-Type C57BL <span class="yellow">Mice</span>
Abstract
Background
Although a long latency period of toxicity after exposure to methylmercury (MeHg) is known to exist in <span class="yellow">humans</span>, few animal studies have addressed this issue. Substantiation of delayed MeHg toxicity in animals would affect the risk evaluation of MeHg.<br><br>Objectives
Our goal in this study was to demonstrate the existence of a latency period in a <span class="yellow">rodent</span> model in which the toxicity of perinatal MeHg exposure becomes apparent only later in life. Our study included metallothionein (MT) knockout <span class="blue">mice</span> because studies have suggested the potential susceptibility of this strain to the neurodevelopmental toxicity of MeHg.<br><br>Methods
Pregnant MT-null and wild-type C57Bl/6J <span class="blue">mice</span> were exposed to MeHg through their diet containing 5 μg Hg/g during gestation and early lactation. We examined behavioral functions of the offspring using frequently used paradigms, including open field behavior (OPF), passive avoidance (PA), and the Morris water maze (MM), at ages of 12–13 and 52–53 weeks.<br><br>Results
At 12 weeks of age, behavioral effects of MeHg were not detected, except for OPF performance in MeHg-exposed MT-null females. At 52 weeks of age, the MeHg-exposed groups showed poorer performance both in PA and MM, and their OPF activity differed from controls. These effects of MeHg appeared exaggerated in the MT-null strain. The brain Hg concentration had leveled off by 13 weeks of age.<br><br>Conclusions
The results suggest the existence of a long latency period after perinatal exposure to low-level MeHg, in which the behavioral effects emerged long after the leveling-off of brain Hg levels. Hence, the initial toxicologic event responsible for the late effects should have occurred before this leveling-off of brain Hg.<br><br><br><br>Methylmercury (MeHg) poses serious and practical concerns for <span class="yellow">human</span> populations regarding perinatal exposure. Fish, especially large predator (carnivore) fish species, accumulate high concentrations of MeHg through the marine food chain, and exposure of pregnant <span class="yellow">women</span> to MeHg through the consumption of fish has evoked widespread concern due to potential effects on offspring. Two large-scale cohort studies in fish-eating populations of Seychelles and Faroe islanders are being conducted; although the former has not found consistent adverse developmental effects of MeHg (Myers et al. 2007), the latter has reported adverse effects (Debes et al. 2006). Fundamental reasons for this discrepancy have not been completely elucidated, and many questions remain regarding the neurotoxicity of MeHg, despite extensive study.
Among the unanswered questions is whether there is a long latency period for behavioral manifestations after exposure to MeHg (Clarkson and Magos 2006; Landrigan et al. 2005; Rice 1996; Weiss et al. 2005a, 2005b). Typical examples of latent toxicity in <span class="yellow">humans</span>, including both acute and chronic MeHg exposures, have been described in detail elsewhere (Weiss et al. 2005a). Davidson et al. (2006) recently suggested that effects of perinatal exposure to MeHg may emerge 9 years after birth in the Seychelles cohort. Consequently, risk assessments of MeHg exposure could be inaccurate because studies (<span class="yellow">human</span> or animal) usually do not focus on later stages of life and therefore could miss delayed effects. The possibility of delayed toxicity is exemplified by the expanded Barker hypothesis, which posits that the origin of some neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases lies in early exposure to environmental chemicals (Landrigan et al. 2005). Although epidemiologic evidence would be ideal for exploring the possibility of delayed toxicity (and, indeed, data from epidemiologic studies form the basis of current risk assessment for developmental toxicity of MeHg), considering the complex effects of numerous potential confounders and the existence of multiple exposures in <span class="yellow">human</span> populations, animal models would likely make important contributions to this field.
Although numerous animal studies have described the developmental neurotoxicity of MeHg (Watanabe and Satoh, 1996), few have addressed the latency issue. Few studies have evaluated the neurobehavioral effects in rodents longitudinally beyond 6 months after perinatal exposure. Spyker (1975) addressed this issue in her pioneering work, reporting the late development of behavioral toxicity in <span class="blue">mice</span> prenatally exposed to MeHg; it appeared, however, that the substantial mortality and retarded growth among the exposed <span class="blue">mice</span> were apparent before weaning, indicating that the doses used (even though some lower dose levels were included) exerted severe toxicity. Using a relatively complex schedule-controlled operant behavior method, <span class="yellow">rats</span> whose parents were exposed to MeHg (0.5 or 6.4 mg/L) from 4 weeks before mating and continuing to postnatal day (PND) 16 were shown to be less sensitive to a change in the reinforcement schedule than were their nonexposed counterparts at 28–32 months of age (Newland et al. 2004). <span class="yellow">Mice</span> that were perinatally exposed to 1 or 3 mg/L MeHg in drinking water did not show significant deviation from controls in behavioral performance (motor performance, memory, and learning) at 5, 15, or 26 months of age, but the lifetime-exposed groups did show a significant deviation (Weiss et al. 2005c). The existence of a latency period (i.e., the absence of effects earlier in life followed by the emergence of effects at a later stage of life) has not been demonstrated in any <span class="yellow">rodent</span> study. In nonhuman primates, delayed emergence of the signs of neurotoxicity was observed several years after the cessation of a 7-year postnatal exposure (Rice 1996).
Metallothionein (MT) protects against the toxicities of a variety of metals. We examined the neurotoxicity and developmental toxicity of metallic Hg in MT I/II-knockout <span class="blue">mice</span> (Yoshida et al. 2004) and demonstrated the susceptibility of this genetically manipulated strain to the toxicity of metallic Hg. In contrast to metallic Hg, MeHg does not induce MT, and MT would not substantially influence the kinetics of MeHg (Yasutake et al. 1998). Several reports, however, have demonstrated protective effects of MT against MeHg toxicity, which was ascribed to the radical scavenging effect of MT (Yao et al. 2000). We also showed that perinatal exposure to MeHg results in altered metabolism of thyroid hormones in neonates that was more distinct in MT-null strains than their wild-type counterparts (Mori et al. 2006). The vulnerability of the MT-null strain suggests that delayed neurobehavioral toxicity due to MeHg, if it does exist, might be more distinctive in this strain.
By utilizing the MT-null strain, we aimed to answer the following two questions: First, could we generate a model in which the toxicity of MeHg would emerge or at least become exaggerated later in life as opposed to earlier in life (i.e., at 3–6 months, which was the timing for most of the earlier studies that used behavioral evaluations)? Second, would the MT-null strain be affected more than its parent C57BL strain? Answering either of these questions not only could influence the risk evaluation of MeHg, but it could also lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of toxicity for perinatal MeHg exposure. To address these issues, we used three behavioral paradigms, the open field (OPF), passive avoidance (PA), and Morris (water) maze (MM) tests, which are often used in this field and which we used in our previous studies on the effects of Hg vapor (Yoshida et al. 2004, 2006). Performances in the MM and PA are said to be the most sensitive to aging (Gower and Lamberty 1993).
We used a dose of 5 μg MeHg/g in the diet, which resulted in a brain Hg level relevant to <span class="yellow">human</span> risk assessment. We evaluated the behavioral end points twice, once around 3 months of age and the other time around 1 year; the latter time roughly corresponds to the period when many behavioral performances, including OPF (Acevedoa et al. 2006; Carrie et al. 1999; Gower and Lamberty 1993), PA (Gower and Lamberty 1993), and MM (Bach et al. 1999; Carrie et al. 1999), show alterations in this <span class="yellow">mouse</span> strain.
Materials and Methods
Animals and MeHg exposure
OLA129/C57BL/6J strain <span class="blue">mice</span> (wild type) and MT I/II-knockout <span class="blue">mice</span> (MT-null) of this strain were provided by K.H. Choo of the Murdoch Institute, Parkville, Australia (Michalska and Choo 1993) and were of a mixed genetic background of 129/Ola and C57BL/6 strains. F1 hybrid <span class="blue">mice</span> were mated with C57BL/6 <span class="blue">mice</span> for six generations at the National Institute for Environmental Studies (Tsukuba, Japan). At 10 weeks of age, single male and female <span class="blue">mice</span> were allowed to cohabit; every female <span class="yellow">mouse</span> was checked each morning for the presence of a vaginal plug. When a plug was confirmed, the day was designated as day 0 of gestation (GD0).
The diet, NIH-07PLD formula (CLEA Japan, Inc., Tokyo, Japan), contained vitamins and trace elements as follows (per kilogram diet): 3.2 mg CuSO4, 88 mg FeSO4, 149 mg MnSO4, 25 mg ZnCO3, 1.6 mg Ca(IO3)2, 11 mg vitamin B1, 4.7 mg vitamin B2, 1.9 mg vitamin B6, 44 mg vitamin E, in addition to 5 μg MeHg/g. This diet was fed to the pregnant <span class="blue">mice</span> starting from GD0 through 10 days after delivery (i.e., PND10). Thereafter, we switched <span class="blue">mice</span> to a diet that did not contain MeHg. We chose GD0 as the beginning of exposure because exposures that started before conception often resulted in fairly high Hg concentrations in fetal/neonatal brains (Kakita et al. 2003), and we chose PND10 to cover the early neonatal period, in which considerable brain growth occurs. In our experimental setting, the neonatal <span class="blue">mice</span> started to eat from the diet bucket and drink from the water bottle from PND10 onward. Control <span class="blue">mice</span> were kept on the same diet but without MeHg (< 0.01 μg Hg/g). On PND1, to avoid the confounding effects due to different litter size, we reduced each litter to six pups (three males and three females when possible), and on PND10, two males and two females from each litter were killed for chemical analyses.
The remaining male and female offspring per litter were weaned on PND28 and used for subsequent behavioral analyses (either at 12–13 weeks or 52–53 weeks, depending on the litter) as described below. We measured body weights of the weaned <span class="blue">mice</span> every 2 weeks. Thus, four experimental groups were used (with or without MeHg exposure for two strains), and each group consisted of 12–13 litters. For half of the litters, the behavioral analyses were conducted at 12–13 weeks of age, and upon completion of the behavioral analyses, the animals were killed under ether anesthesia. We then dissected the organs (brain, liver, and kidneys) for Hg analyses. For the remaining half of the litters, we conducted the behavioral tests at 52–53 weeks of age. The <span class="blue">mice</span> were treated humanely and with regard to alleviation of suffering according to the National Institute for Environmental Studies’ Guidelines for Animal Welfare and the guidelines of St. Marianna University.<br><br>Behavioral evaluations
The details of each behavioral procedure have been described elsewhere (Yoshida et al. 2006). Brief descriptions follow.
For the OPF test, we used an OPF apparatus (Ohara Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with a 60 × 60-cm floor surrounded by walls 60 cm high. The experimental room light was turned off, and a dim light of 80 lux was lit during the experiment. We placed a <span class="yellow">mouse</span> in the center of the floor and monitored its behavior for 10 min using a CCD camera connected to a computer. The position of the center of gravity was calculated by image-analyzing software, which was used to calculate the total distance traveled by the <span class="yellow">mouse</span> as well as the positional preference (either center or peripheral, where peripheral was defined as the area within 10 cm from the wall). We cleaned the OPF apparatus with 70% ethanol between trials.
The apparatus for the PA test (Ohara Co. Ltd.) consisted of a light compartment that illuminated by a 400-lux light and a dark compartment with black opaque walls and lids. The two compartments were separated by a mobile guillotine door. On the first day (training trial), we placed each <span class="yellow">mouse</span> in the light compartment facing away from the guillotine door, which was closed. After 30 sec of introduction, the door was opened; when the <span class="yellow">mouse</span> entered the dark compartment, a brief electric shock (4 mA for 2 sec) was delivered through the metal grid floor. This would force the <span class="yellow">mouse</span> back to the light component. The interval between the opening of the door and the entry to the dark room (in seconds) was recorded and defined as the latency. On the next day, the same procedure was repeated, but without the electric shock (retaining trail). In this PA paradigm, aversive learning was assumed to be established in the training trial, and we used its retention in the retaining trail as the index of learning. Between each individual trial, we cleaned the apparatus with ethanol. The cutoff time of the retention session was 300 sec.
The MM test apparatus (Ohara Co., Ltd.) was a round-shaped water pool with a diameter of 120 cm. A small platform was submerged in the water, which provided a place for <span class="blue">mice</span> to escape from the water (i.e., an aversive stimulus, water temperature = 23 ± 1°C). The water was made opaque by adding white paint so that the <span class="yellow">mouse</span> could not see the submerged platform. In each trial, we released a <span class="yellow">mouse</span> into the pool from a determined position along the wall, and the performance of the <span class="yellow">mouse</span> was monitored by a CCD camera/image analyzer. The time required to reach the platform was recorded. If a <span class="yellow">mouse</span> could not find the platform within 60 sec after release, it was led to the platform and placed on it for 20 sec before being removed. In these cases, a latency of 60 sec was recorded. We conducted the trial once a day up to the fifth day for each <span class="yellow">mouse</span>, and the order of each <span class="yellow">mouse</span> was counterbalanced across the day. On the sixth day, a transfer test (or probe test), which is a trial without the platform, was conducted; in this procedure, we counted the number of times that the <span class="yellow">mouse</span> crossed the position where the platform had been.<br><br>Tissue Hg concentration
The tissue samples were homogenized (10% weight/volume) in distilled water using a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica GmbH, Littau, Switzerland). We determined Hg levels in the homogenates by the oxygen combustion–gold amalgamation method (Ohkawa et al. 1977) using an atomic absorption Hg detector MD-1 (Nippon Instruments, Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan). To ensure the accuracy of the measurement, we included reference material from a dogfish (DORM-2; National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) with a certified value of 4.64 ± 0.26 μg/g in the analyses; the observed values fell within the certified range. The detection limit of the measurement was 0.1 ng Hg.<br><br>Statistics
We analyzed behavioral data for OPF and PA by analysis of variance (ANOVA), taking sex, strain, and MeHg exposure as the factors. All the interactions among these factors were put into the model. When any of the interactions was highly significant, we analyzed the data separately in an appropriate way; for example, if sex × Hg was significant, the data for males and females were separately analyzed for the effects of strain and Hg. Whenever appropriate, ANOVAs were followed by Mann-Whitney U or Student’s t-tests, depending on the nature and distribution of the variables. We analyzed data for the MM by repeated-measures ANOVA, taking the exposure as between-group and trials as within-group variables. The test was performed for each of the four sex and strain combinations separately. The significance level was set at p < 0.05.<br><br>
Results
Body weight
Up to 20 weeks of age, the body weight values of the control and MeHg-exposed groups were not different, regardless of strain or sex. After 28 weeks, except for the wild-type female groups, the MeHg-exposed groups weighed significantly less than the controls (Figure 1).<br><br>OPF
At 12 weeks of age, a three-way ANOVA of the locomotion distance revealed that only strain was a significant factor (p < 0.001), reflecting the longer distance traveled by the MT-null <span class="blue">mice</span> (Figure 2A). Strain was also a significant factor for the proportion of the central-area locomotion (Figure 3A), and Hg exposure marginally affected this outcome. In MT-null females, the proportion of central-area locomotion was higher in MeHg-exposed <span class="blue">mice</span> than in the controls; this difference was not observed in any other strain–sex combination. At 52 weeks of age, the strain × Hg interaction was highly significant (p < 0.001) in an ANOVA of locomotion distance (Figure 2B); MeHg exposure was associated with decreased locomotion distance in wild-type <span class="blue">mice</span> and with increased distance in MT-null <span class="blue">mice</span>. A strain-wise two-way ANOVA (with sex and Hg as the factors) revealed that only Hg was significant in both strains (p < 0.01). Regarding the proportion of the central-area locomotion, the effects of MeHg appeared to depend on sex [i.e., sex × Hg was highly significant (p < 0.001) in the three-way ANOVA; Figure 3B]. Indeed, a sex-wise two-way ANOVA showed significant effects of Hg only in females (p < 0.001).<br><br>PA
At 12 weeks of age, all the groups showed prolonged latency in the second (retention) trial, and no consistent effect of MeHg was recognized regardless of strain or sex (Figure 4A).
At 52 weeks of age, a three-way ANOVA revealed a significant interaction between strain and Hg (p < 0.05); strain-wise two-way ANOVAs revealed a significant effect of Hg on learning in MT-null <span class="blue">mice</span> of both sexes; these groups of <span class="blue">mice</span> showed significantly shorter (less than half) latency times compared to control <span class="blue">mice</span> (Figure 4B). A notable difference between the results at 52 weeks of age and those at 12 weeks was that many of the tested <span class="blue">mice</span> exceeded the cutoff time in the retention trials at 52 weeks, except for the MT-null groups.<br><br>MM
At 13 weeks of age, repeated-measures ANOVA did not indicate any effects of MeHg (Figure 5A). At 52 weeks of age (Figure 5B), wild-type males and MT-null females shared the same statistical results; Hg as well as the Hg × trial interaction were statistically significant. Thus, in both cases, the MeHg groups showed a longer latency, hampering learning performance.<br><br>Tissue Hg concentration
At PND10, which was immediately after the exposure, brain Hg concentrations of the neonatal <span class="blue">mice</span> were approximately ≤ 0.5 μg/g (Table 1). Although the MT-null <span class="blue">mice</span> and females showed slightly higher brain Hg concentrations than the corresponding wild-type group and males, respectively, neither of these differences was significant. At 13 weeks, when the behavioral tests were completed, the brain Hg concentration was comparable to the control (nonexposed) level (approximately 5 ng/g in both the exposed and control brains). Interestingly, MT-null <span class="blue">mice</span> had a significantly lower brain Hg concentration than the corresponding wild-type groups.<br><br>
Discussion
Results of the present study demonstrate the delayed emergence of neurobehavioral toxicity due to perinatal MeHg exposure, which presumably developed after brain MeHg concentrations had leveled off. This emergent toxicity was exaggerated in MT-null <span class="blue">mice</span> and was more distinct in females. To our knowledge, our findings show the first clear-cut demonstrations of a long latency period of MeHg neurobehavioral toxicity in rodents and possible genetic susceptibility for the emergent toxicity.
The exposure level should be considered before discussing the end points. On PND10, immediately after the cessation of MeHg exposure, the brain Hg concentration was approximately 0.5 μg/g, regardless of the strain or sex. In a previous study, the brain Hg concentration in <span class="blue">mice</span> perinatally exposed to 6 mg MeHg/L (via water) peaked between PND0 and PND4 and was approximately three times higher than on PND21 (Goulet et al. 2003). Therefore, the peak brain Hg concentration, which is presumably observed around birth, can be estimated as about 3-fold higher than that on PND10 and would be approximately 1.5 μg/g (0.5 μg/g × 3), which is one of the lowest levels among recent <span class="yellow">rodent</span> studies. As shown by Sakamoto et al. (2002) in their Figure 2, prenatal exposure of <span class="yellow">rats</span> to MeHg showed a peak brain Hg concentration around PND1 that was four to five times greater than the level on PND10. Also, Newland and Rasmussen (2000) reported a slight alteration of a complex operant behavior in <span class="yellow">rats</span> at ages < 2 years at brain Hg concentrations as low as 0.5 μg/g at birth, although statistical significance of this particular effect was not clear. It should be noted that <span class="yellow">rats</span> have different Hg kinetics (Hirayama and Yasutake 1986; Yasutake and Hirayama 1990) due to the high affinity of <span class="yellow">rat</span> hemoglobin for MeHg (Clarkson and Magos 2006).
The most important observation of the present study was that the effects of low-level MeHg exposure were detected only at later stages in the lives of the <span class="blue">mice</span>. Except for the central-area occupancy in OPF in MT-null females, no statistically significant effects of MeHg were observed in any of the three behavioral tests at 12 weeks of age. In contrast, significant effects were observed in all three tests at 52 weeks of age. The brain Hg concentration of the exposed groups had leveled off and was not distinguishable from the non-exposed group at 13 weeks of age, immediately after the first phase of the behavioral testing. Therefore, in the present study, there was a latency period in which the dose and effects could not be detected, although effects were observed 9 months later. Another notable observation was that the emergent manifestation of toxicity was also recognized in the suppression of body weight (except for wild-type females), which only became apparent on or after 28 weeks of age.
The existence of a latency period of as long as several years after chronic (7 years from birth), low-level exposure to MeHg has been described in nonhuman primates (Rice 1996). In that case, however, the Hg concentration in the brain remained elevated, presumably as a result of the long exposure. Indeed, Rice (1996) argued that the minute amount of residual brain Hg could have caused the delayed toxicity. This was clearly not the case in the present study because the Hg concentration leveled off around the time of the first phase of the behavioral study. The absence of behavioral effects at 12 weeks of age ruled out the possibility that the residual behavioral effects were due to elevated Hg early in life. Therefore, the behavioral toxicity that surfaced at 52 weeks of age must have had its origin before the brain Hg concentration leveled off (at or before 13 weeks of age), although the redistribution of Hg to the brain from other sites of deposition, such as the liver, cannot be completely excluded. The long silent period before the manifestations of toxicity emerged suggests that a slow process plays a role in this latent toxicity.
Although an example of a slow process is aging, 52 weeks of age might not be sufficiently old for a <span class="yellow">mouse</span> to be considered aged in the physiologic sense because C57BL/6 <span class="blue">mice</span> have a relatively long life span among <span class="yellow">mouse</span> strains [median survival of 27–31 months (Gower and Lamberty 1993)] and a survival rate at 18–19 months as high as 90% (Institute on Aging HP) (National Institute on Aging 2008). Nevertheless, various behavioral examinations have shown age-related changes in the performance of <span class="blue">mice</span> at approximately 1 year of age in the OPF (Acevedoa et al. 2006; Carrie et al. 1999), MM (Bach et al. 1999; Carrie et al. 1999), and PA (Gower and Lamberty 1993) tests. The observed effects of MeHg, including the deterioration in the PA and MM and suppression in the OPF (in wild-type <span class="blue">mice</span>), were consistent with these reported effects of aging on behavioral function (in the sense described above), except for the increased OPF activity in the MT-null <span class="blue">mice</span>.
Regardless of its neural basis, the basis of neurobehavioral toxicity should be sought in early life stages when the brain Hg concentration is highly elevated (approximately 1.5 μg/g at its peak). Some in vivo experiments have demonstrated several candidate mechanisms of perinatal exposure to MeHg, including abnormal migration of neurons and/or glias (Kakita et al. 2003; Rodier et al. 1984), but at higher Hg concentrations. Using exactly the same exposure protocol as the present study, we found suppressed activity of type III iodo-thyronine deiodinase, a thyroid hormone-metabolizing enzyme, in the brains of PND10 <span class="yellow">mouse</span> neonates (Mori et al. 2006), consistent with our previous study of higher MeHg doses (Watanabe et al. 1999). This perturbation could be one of the candidate mechanisms responsible for the later anomalous behaviors because even a transient change in thyroid hormones during the critical period of perinatal life exerts long-term consequences (Auso et al. 2004).
The effects of MeHg at 52 weeks of age were influenced by two potential modifying factors, sex and strain. In the OPF, while the locomotion was affected in both strains (although the direction was opposite), center occupancy was significantly increased only in the MT-null <span class="blue">mice</span>. In addition, the effects on PA were significant only in MT-null <span class="blue">mice</span>, whereas MeHg at a higher dose was reported to worsen PA performance in <span class="yellow">rats</span> (6–8 weeks of age; Sakamoto et al. 2002). In addition, body weight gain was suppressed in both male and female MT-null <span class="blue">mice</span>, whereas in wild-type <span class="blue">mice</span> the suppression was observed only in males. Taken together, the MT-null strain appeared to be slightly more susceptible to the late-emergent effects of MeHg. Several lines of evidence have shown that MT-I,II is protective against the toxicity of MeHg (Leiva-Presa et al. 2004; Yao et al. 2000), and the present results were basically consistent with these reports. We have also reported the susceptibility of the MT-null strain to the neurotoxic effects of metallic Hg (Yoshida et al. 2004, 2006).
The difference in the susceptibility to MeHg between sexes is still debated (Clarkson and Magos 2006; National Research Council 2000; Vahter 2007). In the present study, some responses to MeHg were different between the sexes, including OPF performance at 12 and 52 weeks of age and MM performance at 52 weeks. The fact that the MT-null female group was the only group affected by MeHg at 12 weeks may suggest the particular susceptibility of females in this strain. This point needs to be clarified in further experiments.
The question remains of why MT-null <span class="blue">mice</span> are susceptible to the delayed neurotoxicity of perinatal MeHg. Apparently kinetics play only a minor role because the strain did not show distinct effects on the brain Hg concentration at PND10. The significantly lower brain Hg concentration in MT-null <span class="blue">mice</span> compared with corresponding wild-type <span class="blue">mice</span> at 13 weeks of age indicated that MT-I,II might play a significant role in the retention of Hg (or MeHg). This is consistent with the results of studies of metallic Hg exposure (Yoshida et al. 2004, 2005); a lower brain Hg concentration may not guarantee lower toxicity, supporting the protective role of the protein. Earlier studies suggest that brain MT-I,II has an important role both in the response to oxidative injury (Potter et al. 2007) and in the process of aging (Kojima et al. 1999). Therefore, the lack of MT can exaggerate the toxicity of MeHg by enhancing the initial effects due to oxygen radicals and/or by accelerating functional aging. Apart from this, an intriguing possibility is that the brain-specific isoform, MT-III, might contribute to the results we obtained because the expression of MT-III, together with MT-I, is increased in the brain of old <span class="yellow">rats</span>, resulting in the low availability of free zinc for synapses (Mocchegiani et al. 2004). The age-dependent expressions of MT isoforms might be modified in MT-null <span class="blue">mice</span>.
Results of the present study might allow the possibility of alternative interpretations due to some potentially confounding factors. For example, except for the wild-type females, we observed significant differences in body weight between MeHg-exposed and non-exposed groups. Because these differences only became clear later in life, they might be associated with the toxicity that also emerged later in life. Manipulation of body weight in rodents alters activity levels, although the reported results are not always consistent with each other (Harrison and Archer 1987; Samuelsson et al. 2008). Also, the differential performance in PA could be related with the potential effects of MeHg on (electric) shock sensitivity, which we did not examine. At least one high-dose study with adult <span class="yellow">rats</span> showed reduced electric sensitivity due to mercury exposure (Wu et al. 1985). These possibilities need to be addressed in future studies.
To summarize, the present results suggest that an initial (or triggering) toxicologic event occurs before the brain Hg concentration stabilizes and that the nature of this event should be either an acceleration of the aging process or interaction with the aging process. Thus, by identifying the physiologic events associated with the functional aging of the examined behavioral tasks, the fundamental toxicologic scar might be revealed.<br><br>
<h3>pmcA2453154</h3>A Novel Role of the NRF2 Transcription Factor in the Regulation of Arsenite-Mediated Keratin 16 Gene Expression in <span class="yellow">Human</span> Keratinocytes
Abstract
Background
Inorganic sodium arsenite (iAs) is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant and is associated with an increased risk of skin hyperkeratosis and cancer.<br><br>Objectives
We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of the keratin 16 (K16) gene by iAs in the <span class="yellow">human</span> keratinocyte cell line HaCaT.<br><br>Methods
We performed reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, luciferase assays, Western blots, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays to determine the transcriptional regulation of the K16 gene by iAs. We used gene overexpression approaches to elucidate the nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2 related factor 2 (NRF2) involved in the K16 induction.<br><br>Results
iAs induced the mRNA and protein expression of K16. We also found that the expression of K16 was transcriptionally induced by iAs through activator protein-1–like sites and an antioxidant response element (ARE) in its gene promoter region. Treatment with iAs also enhanced the production and translocation of the NRF2 transcription factor, an ARE-binding protein, into the nucleus without modification of its mRNA expression. In addition, iAs elongated the half-life of the NRF2 protein. When overexpressed in HaCaT cells, NRF2 was also directly involved in not only the up-regulation of the detoxification gene thioredoxin but also K16 gene expression.<br><br>Conclusions
Our data clearly indicate that the K16 gene is a novel target of NRF2. Furthermore, our findings also suggest that NRF2 has opposing roles in the cell—in the activation of detoxification pathways and in promoting the development of skin disorders.<br><br><br><br>Inorganic sodium arsenite (iAs), a ubiquitous element, is one of the most toxic metals present in the natural environment (Bagla and Kaiser 1996). Arsenicals are found as naturally occurring constituents of soil, food, and drinking water (Wu et al. 1989; Yoshida et al. 2004), and exposure to iAs has been associated with a variety of disease outcomes, including disorders of the skin, urinary bladder, liver, and lung (Tchounwou et al. 2004). In particular, skin hyperkeratosis is a characteristic dermatologic lesion associated with ingestion of arsenic from contaminated groundwater (McLellan 2002; Yoshida et al. 2004). There is also a significant association between hyperkeratosis, nonmelanoma skin cancer (e.g., basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma), and Bowen disease (Col et al. 1999; Rossman et al. 2004). Furthermore, the pathologic features associated with arsenic-induced hyperkeratosis present as typical acanthotic types of psoriasis-like keratosis, characterized by the aberrant proliferation and terminal differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes (Lee et al. 2006). Many epidemiologic studies have shown that hyperkeratoses are the most frequent precursor lesions of some skin cancers (Bagla and Kaiser 1996; Col et al. 1999).
The keratins are the most prominent cytoskeletal proteins in keratinocytes and comprise a large family of proteins that form intermediate filament networks in all epithelial cell types (Moll et al. 1982). Keratin 16 (K16 ) and keratin 6 (K6) genes are constitutively expressed in a number of stratified epithelial levels, including the palmar and plantar epidermis (Moll et al. 1982). In skin diseases characterized by aberrant proliferation and differentiation, such as psoriasis and cancer, K16 is detectable at higher levels compared with normal tissue (Haider et al. 2006). Furthermore, the tissue-specific overexpression of wild-type K16 in the epidermis of transgenic <span class="blue">mice</span> results in the hyperproliferation of keratinocytes and aberrant keratinization of cornified layers, leading to hyperkeratosis of the skin (Takahashi et al. 1994).
Nuclear factor erythoid-derived 2 related factor 2 (NRF2), a “cap ’n’ collar” basic leucine zipper transcription factor, regulates a transcriptional program that maintains cellular redox homeostasis and protects cells from oxidative stress and xenobiotic agents (Ishii et al. 2000; Moi et al. 1994). Several detoxifying and antioxidant genes, including glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1), and thioredoxin (TXN), are regulated by NRF2 through the antioxidant responsive element (ARE) in the respective promoter regions of these genes (McMahon et al. 2001; Wakabayashi et al. 2004). NRF2 is held in the cytoplasm by a cytoskeletal-associated specific inhibitory protein (kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1; KEAP1) under normal cellular redox state conditions, where it is continuously targeted by the proteasomal degradation pathway (McMahon et al. 2003). Upon exposure of the cell to oxidative stress or electrophiles, NRF2 can escape this KEAP1-mediated repression, translocate to the nucleus, and activate the expression of its target genes (Dinkova-Kostova et al. 2002; McMahon et al. 2003).
Recently, studies of Keap1–/–<span class="blue">mice</span> have shown that NRF2 accumulates in the nucleus and constitutively activates the transcription of its target genes, even in the absence of stress signals (Wakabayashi et al. 2003). Most interestingly, however, the skin, esophagus, and forestomach of Keap1-deficient <span class="blue">mice</span> show cornified layer and hyperkeratosis phenotypes. In addition, previous studies have also shown that the expression of NRF2 and ARE-controlled genes is induced by iAs in some cell types (Pi et al. 2003; Sakurai et al. 2005). Furthermore, histochemical analyses have indicated that the expression of K16 is increased in Bowen disease, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma induced by arsenicals (Yu et al. 1993). However, it remains to be determined whether NRF2 can regulate the transcriptional activation of K16 upon iAs exposure in <span class="yellow">human</span> keratinocytes. Hence, these findings prompted us to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of the K16 gene by iAs-induced NRF2 mediation.
Materials and Methods
Chemicals and reagents
A purified preparation of inorganic sodium arsenite (iAs; NaAsO2; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and added directly to the culture medium. A fresh iAs solution was prepared for each new experiment. Cycloheximide (CHX), dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO), and a protease inhibitor cocktail were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). CHX was dissolved in DMSO and stored –20°C until use.<br><br>Cells and culture conditions
The <span class="yellow">human</span> keratinocyte HaCaT cell line was obtained from N.E. Fusenig (German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany). Cells were maintained in monolayer cultures in 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37°C in Dulbecco’s modified Eagles medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal <span class="yellow">bovine</span> serum (FBS), 50 U/mL penicillin and 50 mg/mL streptomycin and nonessential amino acids (Gibco BRL, Paisley, UK).<br><br>RNA preparation and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis
We determined RNA expression levels by semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis as described previously (Sugioka et al. 2004). Total RNA was isolated from HaCaT cells using the GeneElute Mammalian Total RNA Kit (Sigma). The specific primers used for first-strand cDNA synthesis and PCR were as follows: K16 [forward, 5′-GAT GCT TGC TCT GAG AGG TC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CCA GCA AGA TCT GGT ACT CC-3′; Gene Bank accession no. NM_005557 (National Center for Biotechnology Information 2007)]; c-Jun (forward, 5′-CCT GTT GCG GCC CCG AAA CT-3′, and reverse, 5′-ACC ATG CCT GCC CCG TTG AC-3′; NM_002228); c-Fos (forward, 5′-TTT GCC TAA CCG CCA CGA TGA T-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTG CCG CTT TCT GCC ACC TC-3′; NM_005252); NRF2 (forward, 5′-AGA TTC ACA GGC CTT TCT CG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CAG CTC TCC CTA CCG TTG GA-3′; AF323119); KEAP1 (forward, 5′-CAG AGG TGG TGG TGT TGC TTA T-3′, and reverse, 5′-AGC TCG TTC ATG ATG CCA AAG-3′; NM_012289); TXN (forward, 5′-CAG GGG AAT GAA AGA AAG G-3′, and reverse, 5′-CAA GGT GAA GCA GAT CG-3′; NM_003329), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a loading control (forward, 5′-ACC ACA GTC CAT GCC ATC AC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA-3′, NM_002046). PCR products were separated on a 1.8% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide.<br><br>Western blot analysis
We performed Western blot analysis as described previously (Sugioka et al. 2004). Briefly, nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were extracted using the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For protein extraction, the cells were lysed in a buffer containing complete protease inhibitor cocktail. We measured protein concentrations using the DC Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, USA). Equal amounts of protein were then resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Bucks, UK). Immunoblotting was carried out with specific antibodies in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20. The primary antibodies were as follows: K16 (Neomarkers, Fremont, CA, USA), NRF2 and KEAP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), c-Jun (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA), and β-actin (Sigma). After washing, the membranes were probed with <span class="yellow">horseradish</span> peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and developed by chemiluminescence using the ECL Plus Detection Kit (Amersham Biosciences).<br><br>Plasmids, transfections, and luciferase assays
<span class="yellow">Human</span> K16 promoter regions of varying lengths (pXK-1, 3, 4, 5-1, and 5-2) were provided by Y-N Wang (National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan). These DNA fragments were prepared from HaCaT cells and were ligated into the pXP-1 luciferase vector (Wang and Chang 2003). The p3xARE/Luc vector, harboring three tandem repeats of ARE, was donated by X.L. Chen (Discovery Research, AtheroGenics Inc., Alpharetta, GA, USA) (Chen et al. 2003). The wild-type NRF2 expression vector (WT-NRF2) was a gift from H.S. So (Wonkwang University School of Medicine, Korea) (So et al. 2006). NRF2 cDNA was subcloned into a pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA). For the transfection of reporter plasmids, we seeded HaCaT cells into six-well plates at a density of 80% the previous day. Cells were then transfected with a total of each luciferase reporter construct (2.5 μg) using LipofectAMINE plus (Invitrogen). To control for the efficiency of transfection, Renilla luciferase gene expression was monitored using either the pRL-CMV or pRL-TK vectors (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). For overexpression of WT-NRF2, we normalized the total plasmid concentration using the pcDNA3.1(+) empty vector. Thirty-six hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing either vehicle (PBS) or iAs for 6 hr. After iAs exposure, we harvested cells and analyzed them for luciferase activity using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega).
For the investigation of the role of NRF2 in regulating K16 gene expression, transfection of an NRF2 expression plasmid into HaCaT cells was carried out using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured in 100-mm plates 24 hr before transfection. The expression plasmid WT-NRF2 (15 μg) was then transfected into the cells for 48–60 hr. As a negative control, we used 15 μg of the pcDNA3.1(+) empty vector.<br><br>Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays (EMSA)
We extracted and measured nuclear proteins as described above. Nuclear protein/ DNA complexes were subjected to electrophoresis in nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels containing 2% glycerol in 0.25% Tris-borate/EDTA buffer and transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon transfer membranes (Amersham Biosciences) for detection using the Light-Shift EMSA kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, with minor modifications. We incubated 10-μg aliquots of nuclear extract with the DNA probe in a binding reaction buffer containing 10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.25 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.05% NP-40 detergent, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) for 30 min at room temperature. For supershift assays, 2 μg of either a polyclonal anti-NRF2 or an anti-c-Jun antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added with the nuclear protein for 2 hr at 4°C before the labeled oligonucleotide probe was added. Biotin-labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotides WT-K16ARE (–157/–132, 5′-GGGGAACCTGGAGTCAGCAGT-TAGGA-3′), containing an ARE site (–148/ –140, underlined) in the <span class="yellow">human</span> K16 promoter region, and Mut-K16ARE (5′-GGGGAA-CCTGGAGTCAaaAGTTAGGA-3′, mutated GC box in the ARE) were prepared by Fasmac (Kanagawa, Japan). A consensus ARE probe was purchased from Panomics, Inc. (Redwood City, CA, USA). For competition binding of the K16 ARE-complexes, we used an unlabeled AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide (5′-TATC-GATAAGCTATGAGTCATCCGGG-3′). The binding specificity was confirmed in each case by the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide.<br><br>CHX chase experiment
We investigated the posttranscriptional regulation of both the steady-state levels and half-life of the NRF2 protein by CHX chase analysis. Cells were incubated in serum-free medium in the absence or presence of iAs for 6 hr. The culture medium was then replaced with serum-free medium containing CHX (100 μg/mL). We prepared cell lysates at 0, 10, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min after iAs treatment. Whole-cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies against NRF2.<br><br>Statistics
All the data generated from at least three independent experiments and expressed as the mean ± SD were analyzed by the Student’s t-test. Statistical comparisons were made by logarithmic transformation of the normalized values. We considered p-values < 0.01 to be statistically significant.<br><br>
Results
K16 expression is induced by iAs in HaCaT cells
We wanted to determine whether the K16 mRNA is transcriptionally regulated by iAs, and treated HaCaT cells with this compound for various time periods over a range of doses. After treatment of HaCaT cells with 1–20 μM iAs, the expression of K16 mRNA was increased compared with the control at 6 hr (Figure 1A) but had declined to basal levels at 24 hr. The increase in the K16 protein levels after 6 hr of iAs exposure was just detectable at 10–20 μM, but a dose-dependent increase was more evident at 10 hr (Figure 1B). This enhancement of K16 expression had declined to basal levels at 24 hr.<br><br>Identification of the iAs responsive region in the K16 gene promoter
To investigate the mechanisms underlying the transactivation of the K16 gene by iAs, we first examined the response of the K16 regulatory region to this compound using a luciferase reporter gene assay. The dose-dependent activation of K16 transcription after iAs treatment was observed with a construct containing a 515-bp fragment of the K16 promoter (Figure 2A). To further elucidate the region containing the iAs responsive element, we examined a series of deletions of the 5′-flanking region of K16 gene. The ARE sequence in the pXK-5–1 vector contains an activator protein-1 (AP-1)–like element followed by a GC box. As shown in Figure 2B, an enhancement in the reporter activity levels was observed for the promoter constructs, pXK-1, 3, 4, and 5-1, in response to 20 μM iAs. A decline in reporter activity, however, depended on the number of AP-1–like sites, and the results for the pXK-5-1 construct show also that ARE is activated by iAs. In contrast, no significant activation was observed using a pXK-5-2 construct in response to 20 μM iAs.<br><br>Expression of AP-1 transcriptions factor and c-Jun production following iAs treatment
We examined AP-1 transcription factors c-Jun and c-Fos expression in iAs-treated HaCaT cells by semiquantitative RT-PCR. iAs-induced c-Jun expression was observed during the first 3 hr after treatment (data not shown). An appreciable induction of c-Jun was also confirmed after 6 hr, but this was down-regulated by 24 hr after iAs treatment (Figure 3A). In contrast, the expression of c-Fos was only transiently detectable at 3 hr (data not shown) but was not observed during the 6–24 hr period of this experiment. As shown in Figure 3B, iAs-enhanced c-Jun production can be observed in a dose-dependent manner at 6 hr, but it declines from 10 to 24 hr.<br><br>iAs potently induces the translocation of NRF2 and activates the ARE of the K16 promoter
The results of our reporter assays suggested that iAs stimulates not only the AP-1–like sites but also the ARE site within the K16 gene promoter in HaCaT cells (Figure 3). In addition, several oxidative stress agents and toxic chemicals, including iAs, have been reported to induce the expression of ARE-dependent genes in several cell types (Pi et al. 2003; Sakurai et al. 2005). On the basis of our observations and some recent reports, we thus hypothesized that iAs would have the ability to activate the ARE of the K16 gene promoter directly, resulting in the induction of K16 expression in HaCaT cells. To confirm that the K16 ARE indeed functions as an iAs-responsive transcriptional control element, we performed transient transfections of HaCaT cells with a p3xARE/Luc construct and then subjected these cells to iAs for 6 hr. As shown in Figure 4A, treatment of HaCaT cells with iAs results in a dramatic increase in ARE-driven promoter activity. Likewise, EMSA using a consensus ARE probe show that iAs-induced ARE-binding complexes increase markedly, in a dose-dependent fashion (Figure 4B). These results indicate that iAs has the ability to activate the ARE-driven genes. We performed further EMSA experiments using an ARE probe specific to the K16 proximal promoter region (WT-K16ARE) and found that K16ARE–nuclear protein complexes formation is augmented by iAs in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4C). Moreover, the formation of these complexes is specifically inhibited by the addition of excess unlabeled oligonucleotide competitor (Figure 4B,C), whereas an excess of an unlabeled AP-1 probe competes only marginally for K16ARE binding (Figure 4C).
The NRF2 transcription factor has been shown to bind to AREs upon translocation into the nucleus, resulting in the induction of ARE-mediated genes (Wakabayashi et al. 2004). To examine whether iAs induces and translocates NRF2 into the nucleus in HaCaT cells, we treated these cells with iAs for either 3 or 6 hr. As shown in Figure 4D, a dose-dependent accumulation of NRF2 protein was observed in the nucleus upon treatment with iAs for 6 hr. This was not observed in the parallel experiment performed over the 3-hr time course.
Supershift EMSA analysis using an NRF2 antibody showed that the iAs-induced and iAs-translocated NRF2 protein binds to the WT-K16ARE probe containing the ARE sequence of the K16 proximal promoter region (5′-GGAGTCAGC-3′) that comprises an AP-1–like site and a GC box, whereas the supershift of c-Jun was not observed (Figure 4E). To identify whether the GC box is dispensable for the iAs-stimulated binding activity of NRF2, we next performed EMSA analyses with either WT- or a Mut-K16ARE probe containing an intact AP-1–like element but a mutated GC box. As shown in Figure 4F, the K16ARE–nuclear protein complexes and supershifted bands that were enhanced by iAs treatment were largely abolished by the addition of the Mut-K16ARE probe.<br><br>iAs stabilizes the NRF2 protein
We examined the effects of iAs treatment on the function of KEAP1 in HaCaT cells. Treatment with iAs did not alter the expression levels of KEAP1 mRNA or protein over either a 3 or 6 hr time course (Figure 5A). Next, we examined the effects of iAs on the expression of NRF2 mRNA in HaCaT cells. Exposure to iAs did not significantly alter the steady-state levels of NRF2 mRNA (data not shown). Production of NRF2 protein, however, was observed to increase in both a dose-and time-dependent manner (Figure 4D). To further examine the stabilization of NRF2 protein by iAs, we monitored the decay of basal and iAs-induced NRF2 proteins after inhibition of protein synthesis by CHX (Figure 5B). The results of this analysis revealed that the NRF2 protein levels decrease by approximately 50% within 30 min of treatment with CHX in cells that had not been exposed to iAs. Only trace amounts of NRF2 are then detectable after 60 min of exposure to CHX in these cells. The HaCaT cells were then pretreated with iAs for 6 hr before their exposure to CHX in a similar timecourse experiment. The levels of NRF2 in these iAs-treated cells were again found to decrease by about 50%, but only after 120 min of CHX exposure.<br><br>NRF2 plays a crucial role in the regulation of K16 gene expression in HaCaT cells
To confirm the functional role of NRF2 in the induction of K16 gene expression by iAs, we investigated whether the expression of K16 mRNA is induced by the overexpression of NRF2 (WT-NRF2) in HaCaT cells. We also investigated the expression of the detoxification gene TXN, which is highly induced by a variety of oxidative stimuli through NRF2-mediated ARE transactivation (Kim et al. 2001). The expression of TXN gene in untransfected cells after treatment with iAs was stronger than that of the control cells (Figure 6A). When the cells were transfected with WT-NRF2 and then treated with or without iAs, the expression of TXN mRNA was augmented markedly compared with the empty-vector control. Similarly, the expression of K16 mRNA was also induced in cells transfected with WT-NRF2 in the absence or presence of iAs. We next performed a transient transfection of HaCaT cells with the pXK-5–1 luciferase vector together with the WT-NRF2 vector. The overexpression of NRF2 in increasing concentrations resulted in significant enhancement of the ARE-mediated K16 promoter activation (Figure 6B).<br><br>
Discussion
In the present study, we showed for the first time that iAs induces the transcriptional activation of K16 in the <span class="yellow">human</span> keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT, through the ARE present in its gene promoter. It has been reported previously that treatment with iAs enhances the production and translocation of NRF2 into the nucleus in several cell types. However, until now it has remained uncertain whether the induction of NRF2 by iAs mediates the transcriptional activation of the K16 gene in keratinocytes. In our current experiments, we demonstrated that iAs elongates the half-life of the NRF2 protein, which results in its increased expression levels. Furthermore, this iAs-induced NRF2 protein was shown to bind to the ARE sequences in the promoter region of the K16 gene. Finally, by overexpressing NRF2, we have clarified that its induction is involved in not only the gene expression of the detoxification gene TXN, but also in the upregulation of K16 expression in HaCaT cells through the ARE in the K16 gene promoter. These experiments indicate an important and novel function for NRF2 in the regulation of K16 in keratinocytes and also help to further explain the molecular mechanisms underlying arsenic-mediated epidermal hyperkeratosis.
In our present experiments, the expression levels of K16 mRNA and protein were indeed found to be enhanced by iAs in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1). In addition, luciferase assays of the K16 promoter revealed that iAs enhances its activity in a dose-dependent fashion, which is stimulated by AP-1–like sites and an ARE (Figure 2). The promoter of the <span class="yellow">human</span> K16 gene was recently cloned and sequenced, and several AP-1–like sites were found within the –515-bp region of the gene (Wang and Chang 2003). AP-1 transcription factor can be formed by the dimerization of either Jun or Jun/Fos family members (Eferl and Wagner 2003). In the present study, the increased expression of c-Jun, but not c-Fos was evident in the nuclei of HaCaT cells after iAs treatment (Figure 3). Our findings thus suggest that the activation of c-Jun/AP-1 is one of the essential steps in the regulation of K16 gene expression by iAs exposure in HaCaT cells.
It has been well documented that the ARE core sequence includes an AP-1–like binding site (TGAC/GTCA), followed by a GC box (Rushmore et al. 1991; Xie et al. 1995). We have found in our current analyses that the AP-1–like site within the K16 promoter region from –148 to –140 bp (5′-GGAGTCAGC-3′) resembles a consensus ARE sequence. Recent studies have shown that AREs can be specifically bound by complexes of several basic-leucine zipper transcription factors, including NRF2 (Ishii et al. 2000; Moi et al. 1994). NRF2 heterodimerizes with either AP-1 or small MAF (MAFG, MAFK, and MAFF) proteins (MAF, v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog) and binds to the ARE to induce the transcription of ARE-mediated genes (Motohashi et al. 2002). In the present investigation, EMSA and supershift assays showed that the NRF2 proteins in the nuclei bind to the ARE sequences of K16 promoter region after iAs exposure. iAs-induced c-Jun, however, does not bind to this ARE (Figure 4E). c-Jun may thus act on other AP-1 sites within the K16 promoter region. These results also suggest that other heterodimer partners of NRF2 are involved in the ARE regulation of K16 promoter region underlying iAs-mediated the K16 gene expression. Gel shifts with an K16Mut-ARE probe (harboring a mutation in the ARE GC box) clearly show that the ARE sequence in the K16 promoter, particularly the terminal GC dinucleotide, is essential for mediating iAs-induced K16 transactivation and NRF2 binding (Figure 4F). Several investigations have suggested that the GC nucleotides within the ARE are essential for both the basal and oxidative stress–induced activities of the ARE-related genes, NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone 1 (NQO1) and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) (Wasserman and Fahl 1997; Wild et al. 1998). Our current results are consistent with these earlier studies in showing that the formation of the iAs-responsive NRF2/ARE complexes is reduced by a mutation in the GC box. Collectively, our present observations reveal a new molecular mechanism in which iAs-induced K16 gene expression is also regulated by activation NRF2/ARE pathways.
It has been widely accepted that oxidative stress disrupts sequestration of NRF2 by KEAP1, permits NRF2 translocation to the nucleus, and transactivates the expression of various NRF2-mediated genes (Dinkova-Kostova et al. 2002; McMahon et al. 2003). Our present study showed that iAs elongates the half-life of the NRF2 protein but has no effects upon KEAP1 expression (Figure 5). Other studies have also demonstrated that the production of NRF2 is increased by various inducers via posttranscriptional control (Nguyen et al. 2003; Stewart et al. 2003). Several earlier reports also indicated that either oxidative stress or antioxidant substances stabilize the expression of the NRF2 protein, either by directly modifying the cysteine residues on KEAP1 to disrupt the NRF2/KEAP1 complex (Dinkova-Kostova et al. 2002) or by facilitating the release of NRF2 through the phosphorylation of the NRF2/KEAP1 complex (Bloom and Jaiswal 2003). These findings are largely consistent with our present finding that iAs stabilizes the expression of NRF2 in HaCaT cells by elongating the protein half-life.
Recently, Wakabayashi et al. (2003) demonstrated that NRF2 accumulates in the nucleus at constitutively high levels and produces various cytoprotective genes in embryonic fibroblast- and liver-derived Keap1-null <span class="blue">mice</span>. Surprisingly, these Keap1-deficient <span class="blue">mice</span> also show a thicker stratum corneum epidermis, abnormal keratinization, and cornification in the esophagus and forestomach (hyperkeratosis). K6 was found to be strongly expressed in the esophageal epithelium of these <span class="blue">mice</span>. These results indicate that K6 is also a target gene of NRF2. In addition, the promoter of the K6 gene bears a remarkable sequence similarity to the K16 promoter (Jiang et al. 1993). Therefore, we examined whether K16 gene expression is also regulated by NRF2. In the present study, the gene expression and transactivation of K16 were dramatically induced by transfection with WT-NRF2 via in HaCaT cells, clearly demonstrating that NRF2 acts as a direct transcriptional regulator of the K16 gene (Figure 6). In addition, we also showed that transfection of HaCaT cells with WT-NRF2 induces the expression of detoxification gene TXN (Figure 6A). NRF2 may thus have a major role to play in the development of hyperkeratosis, whereas the expression and induction of NRF2 is implicated in cell protection against a variety of genotoxic and cytotoxic effects. Hence, based on these results and on the findings from studies of Keap1 knockout <span class="blue">mice</span>, iAs may both cause hyperkeratosis and induce detoxification enzymes via the modification of NRF2. Given that there are both beneficial and adverse effects of NRF2 activity, caution will therefore be needed when using antioxidants for prevention and therapy. Although further investigations are needed, we believe that our findings provide important clues for the design of future therapies for arsenic-mediated hyperkeratosis and for treatments involving the molecular targeting of NRF2.<br><br>Conclusion
Our findings clearly demonstrate that the induction of the K16 gene in <span class="yellow">human</span> keratinocytes by iAs depends on NRF2 activation. Our results thus represent a valuable initial effort to elucidate the relationship between the K16 gene and the NRF2 transcription factor, which may be responsible for hyperkeratosis.<br><br>
<h3>pmcA2575403</h3>Foamy Macrophages from Tuberculous <span class="yellow">Patients</span>' Granulomas Constitute a Nutrient-Rich Reservoir for <span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span> Persistence
Abstract
Tuberculosis (TB) is characterized by a tight interplay between <span class="yellow">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</span> and host cells within granulomas. These cellular aggregates restrict bacterial spreading, but do not kill all the bacilli, which can persist for years. In-depth investigation of <span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span> interactions with granuloma-specific cell populations are needed to gain insight into mycobacterial persistence, and to better understand the physiopathology of the disease. We have analyzed the formation of foamy macrophages (FMs), a granuloma-specific cell population characterized by its high lipid content, and studied their interaction with the tubercle bacillus. Within our in vitro <span class="yellow">human</span> granuloma model, <span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span> long chain fatty acids, namely oxygenated mycolic acids (MA), triggered the differentiation of <span class="yellow">human</span> monocyte-derived macrophages into FMs. In these cells, mycobacteria no longer replicated and switched to a dormant non-replicative state. Electron microscopy observation of <span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span>–infected FMs showed that the mycobacteria-containing phagosomes migrate towards host cell lipid bodies (LB), a process which culminates with the engulfment of the bacillus into the lipid droplets and with the accumulation of lipids within the microbe. Altogether, our results suggest that oxygenated mycolic acids from <span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span> play a crucial role in the differentiation of macrophages into FMs. These cells might constitute a reservoir used by the tubercle bacillus for long-term persistence within its <span class="yellow">human</span> host, and could provide a relevant model for the screening of new antimicrobials against non-replicating persistent mycobacteria.<br><br>Introduction
Tuberculosis caused by <span class="yellow">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</span> (<span class="yellow">M.tb</span>) remains one of the leading causes of mortality in the world, with around 2 million deaths each year [1]. Most individuals remain asymptomatic after the primary infection with only 10% at risk of developing an active disease during their life [2]. In asymptomatic individuals, the bacilli are not cleared but rather persist in a dormant state, from which they may reactivate and induce clinical disease at later stages [3].
The prognosis of the disease depends on the host's efficiency to constrain the bacilli at the site of infection. When inhaled <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> reach the lungs, they are internalized by lung macrophages. The latter trigger the accumulation at the infectious site of macrophages, lymphocytes and dendritic cells, to form a granuloma, which is a major histo-pathological feature of TB. Within granulomas, macrophages differentiate into epithelioïd cells (differentiated macrophages), and/or fuse to form multinucleated giant cells (MGC). Macrophages with large numbers of lipid-free vacuoles, as well as macrophages filled with lipid-containing bodies, also called foamy macrophages (FM) are also found within granulomatous structures in both experimental animal models and <span class="yellow">human</span> disease [4],[5]. The above cells are surrounded by a rim of lymphocytes, and at later stages, a tight coat of fibroblasts encloses the structure [6]. Although the structure and cell composition of granulomas are well known, the biology of these inflammatory structures and, more specifically, the role of granuloma-specific cell types, remain largely unknown.
We have previously developed an in vitro model of <span class="yellow">human</span> tuberculous granulomas to gain insight into the survival strategies of the tubercle bacillus within its <span class="yellow">human</span> host. This model now enables the characterization of granuloma-specific cell types, and their modulation by <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> [7]. The main advantage of this model over in vivo animal models or ex vivo <span class="yellow">human</span> biopsy samples, is the availability of live granuloma cells which facilitates analysis of their cell biology. Using this model we have recently shown that, within granulomas, large multinucleated giant cells, also known as Langhans giant cells, result from the induction of granuloma macrophage fusion by <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> glycolipids [8]. We have shown that these cells have lost the ability to mediate bacterial uptake upon maturation, but have conserved their ability to mediate antigen presentation [9].
The differentiation of macrophages into FMs has been particularly well described in individuals developing a postprimary, also known as secondary or adult, TB. These postprimary infections are considered to be the result of re-infection or reactivation of a primary TB [10]. FMs have been described in leprosy <span class="yellow">patients</span> or <span class="yellow">M. avium</span>-infected AIDS (Acquired ImmunoDeficiency Syndrome) <span class="yellow">patients</span>, and in chronic stages of <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> infection in <span class="blue">mice</span> [4],[11],[12]. The foamy aspect of these macrophages is the result of intracellular lipid accumulation within lipid bodies, also called lipid droplets or lipid vacuoles [13],[14],[15]. In an experimental model of leukocyte infection, it was recently suggested that BCG (Bacille Calmette Guerin) infection can induce, in a TLR2-dependent fashion, the rapid formation of lipid bodies carrying out part of the eicosanoïd biosynthesis that usually accompanies the infection, thus pointing to an active role for lipid bodies during the course of infection [16]. However, the mechanisms regulating this lipid accumulation during mycobacterial infection and their significance in the physiopathology of tuberculosis are not understood. Most of the studies on TB granulomas have focused on the contribution of host components, but very little is known about the role played by bacterial constituents in terms of granuloma formation and progression.
The present work was aimed at deciphering the role of FMs in <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> survival within <span class="yellow">human</span> granulomas. To test our working hypothesis according to which FMs constitute a nutrient-rich reservoir for <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> persistence, we used our in vitro model of <span class="yellow">human</span> granulomas to analyze the formation of FMs and their role during <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> infection. We showed that only highly virulent mycobacteria (<span class="yellow">M.tb</span>, <span class="yellow">M. avium</span>) and not saprophytic ones (<span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>) could induce the formation of FMs in mature granulomas. Moreover, we demonstrated that oxygenated mycolic acids specifically produced by the above pathogenic species were responsible for FMs formation. Once differentiated, FMs were unable to mediate phagocytosis of new bacilli and their microbicidal activity was reduced. <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> was not killed in FMs but instead persisted in a non-replicating state, and over-expressed dormancy genes. Noteworthy, in foamy macrophages, <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>-containing phagosomes were shown to migrate towards lipid bodies which they progressively surrounded and engulfed. As a result, bacteria were freed into lipid bodies, thus favoring the bacilli's access to nutrients. From these data, we propose that FMs could form a secure reservoir for the tubercle bacilli.<br><br>Methods
<span class="yellow">Human</span> samples
<span class="yellow">Human</span> blood samples, purchased from the French National Blood provider of Toulouse, were collected from fully anonymized non-tuberculous control donors, an ethical committee approval was, therefore, not necessary. This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Helsinki Declaration, with informed consent obtained from each donor.
We chose to work on lymph node samples rather than lung biopsies, which are usually only paraffin-embedded, because staining for lipids can only be performed on frozen samples. Lymph node biopsies were taken for diagnosis purposes, in ten non-<span class="yellow">HIV</span> <span class="yellow">patients</span>. For each biopsy, a fragment was sent to the microbiology laboratory, another was frozen in liquid nitrogen and the main part was fixed in formalin and paraffin-embedded for histological examination. <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> was identified in 9 lymph node biopsies and from the lung aspiration in the last <span class="yellow">patient</span>. This latter case showed no signs of necrosis, and no FMs were found in the lymph node biopsy. This study complies with the guidelines of the declaration of Helsinki.<br><br>Bacterial strains and culture conditions
Wild-type <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span> and <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>/hma strains were previously described [17], <span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span>-GFP were a kind gift from Dr. C. Guilhot (CNRS-IPBS, Toulouse France). Bacilli were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 medium (Difco) supplemented with 10% albumin–dextrose–catalase (Difco). Fluorescent <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span> and <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>/hma were obtained by FITC labelling as described in [18].<br><br>Isolation of RNA from intraphagosomal <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>
Six and 12 days post-infection (MOI 10), macrophages and FMs (5×106) were washed twice with PBS, scraped off the cell dishes and recovered by centrifugation. The cell pellets were lysed with lysis buffer (RNEasy mini kit, Quiagen) and transferred to 2 ml Eppendorf-tubes containing a 0.5 ml suspension of 0.1 mm-diameter glass beads (Biospec). Mycobacteria were disrupted using a bead beater (Retsch) followed by a 5 min centrifugation at 14 000g. RNA contained in the supernatant was then column-purified according to the manufacturer's conditions using the RNEasy mini kit (Qiagen) and quantified.<br><br>Quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR
In RNA samples DNA contamination was excluded by DNAse I treatment (Ambion). 1 µg total RNA was reverse-transcribed using random hexamer primers (Ambion) and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was performed on cDNA using the SYBR green essay (Applied Biosystems). Reverse and forward primers used are listed below in Table 1. Fluorescence was measured by ABIPrism 7300 (Applied Biosystems). The calculated threshold cycle (Ct) value for each gene of interest was normalized to the Ct value for 16S and the fold expression was calculated using the formula: fold change = 2−Δ.(ΔCt) [19]. Real-time PCR conditions include initial activation at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec, annealing and extension at 65°C for 1 min. The gene induction ratios were obtained by comparing gene expression levels in intracellular bacilli with those of log-phase in vitro-grown bacilli. RNAs were isolated from two independent macrophage infections.<br><br>In vitro <span class="yellow">human</span> granuloma formation
In vitro granulomas were obtained as previously described [7]. Briefly, 1×106 freshly isolated Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) were incubated with 1×104 viable <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>, or 1×103 viable <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span> or <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>/hma. The culture medium was RPMI-1640+Glutamax (Difco), containing 7.5% <span class="yellow">human</span> AB serum (Sigma-Aldrich).<br><br>Macrophage differentiation
2.5×106 PBMCs prepared in RPMI-1640+Glutamax (Difco) were plated over coverslips in 24-well plates. After 2 h culture at 37°C, cells were washed 3 times with PBS and then refed with RPMI-1640+Glutamax (Difco), containing 7.5% <span class="yellow">human</span> AB serum. After 6 days of culturing, macrophages were differentiated.<br><br>Respiratory burst assay with Nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)
<span class="yellow">Human</span> monocyte derived macrophages were stimulated with <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>/hma for 2 h at 37°C, washed and reincubated in mycobacterium-free medium. After 2 days of differentiation into FMs, macrophages were co-stained with NBT (2 mg/ml Sigma-Aldrich) and Nile red (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at 37°C. Stained cells were fixed and then analysed with an inverted microscope (Nikon TE 300).<br><br>Phagocytosis and Survival test
For phagocytosis assays, differentiated macrophages were incubated with <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>/hma mycolic acids for 2 days and then infected with 1×108 labeled mycobacteria per well for 90 min, washed 3 times with PBS and chased for 3 h in fresh culture medium.
For survival experiments, macrophages were infected with <span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span>-GFP (10 bacteria/cell), washed 3 times with PBS (Gibco) and re-incubated in fresh culture medium. At selected time points thereafter (1, 3, 6, 10 and 14 days) cells were labeled with Nile red (Sigma-Aldrich), fixed and observed under a confocal microscope. The amount of mycobacteria per cells was evaluated. (100 cells were analyzed for each time point).<br><br>Lipid body staining and immunostaining
Granuloma cells were collected and plated onto glass coverslips with a cytospin (Thermo Shandon) fixed for 30 min in PBS-PFA 4% and stained with Oil red-O (Sigma-Aldrich) as described [20]. The slides were then counterstained with haematoxylin (Dako Cytomation) and observed under an inverted microscope (Nikon TE 300).
For fluorescence analysis, granuloma cells or macrophages were collected in PBS, lipid bodies were stained with Nile red (Sigma-Aldrich, 0.1 µg/ml, from a stock solution in methanol) for 15 min washed with PBS, fixed for 30 min in PBS-PFA 4%, mounted with the fluorescent mounting medium (Dako Cytomation) and observed under a confocal microscope.
In order to distinguish the lipids contained within lipid bodies, from those of the cell membrane, we used the fluorescent emission spectrum properties of Nile red which depend upon the kind of lipid associated with Nile red, i.e. for triacylglycerol: λmax em = 590 nm, for phospholipids: λmax em = 640 nm (Molecular Probes handbook). On confocal microscopy pictures, the phospholipid background of both macrophages and FM appears in red and the triacylglycerol-rich lipid bodies appear in white. Cells were considered to be positive for Nile red staining when more than 50% of the cell surface was stained (see Figure S2).<br><br>Mycolic acid isolation
Bacterial residues obtained after lipid extraction with organic solvents [17] were saponified with a mixture of 40% KOH aqueous solution and methoxyethanol (1∶7, v/v) at 110°C for 3 hours in a screw-capped tube. After acidification, fatty acids were extracted with diethylether, derivatised into methyl esters with diazomethane and analyzed by analytical thin-layer chromatography on silica Gel 60 (Silica Gel 60 Macherey-Nagel) using either dicholoromethane or petroleum ether/diethylether (9∶1, v/v, five runs). Visualization of lipid spots was performed by spraying the plates with molybdophosphoric acid (10% in ethanol), followed by charring.<br><br>Processing for electron microscopy
Granulomas were fixed for 1 hour at room temperature with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.1 M sucrose, 5 mM CaCl2 and 5 mM MgCl2. After two successive 15-min washes with the same buffer, the granulomas were postfixed for 1 hour at RT with 1% osmium tetroxide (Electron Microscopy Science) in the same buffer devoid of sucrose. The granulomas were scraped off the culture dishes with a rubber policeman and concentrated in 1% agarose in the same buffer. After a one hour treatment at room temperature with 1% uranyl acetate in Veronal buffer, the samples were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and embedded in Spurr resin. Thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.<br><br>Image acquisition in confocal microscopy
The images were obtained using a Leica confocal fluorescence microscope (SP2) equipped with a Plan Apo 40×1.4 Ph 6 objective (Olympus Optical) and CoolSNAP-Pro CF digital camera in conjunction with Image-Pro Plus version 4.5.1.3 software (Media Cybernetics). The images were edited using Adobe Photoshop CS2 9 software (Adobe Systems).<br><br>
Results
Foamy macrophages are strongly associated with necrotic lesions and often contain <span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span>
We analyzed lymph node biopsies from 10 tuberculous <span class="yellow">patients</span> as a first step for evaluating the role of FMs within tuberculous granulomas. A section through a representative biopsy is shown in Figure 1. Well-circumscribed and -differentiated granulomatous structures were observed in all the samples (Figure 1A). Classically, lesions display a necrotic center (N), an interface area between the necrotic center and the histiocytes (I), and some peripheral granulomas (G). Only seven out of ten <span class="yellow">patients</span> presented lesions displaying central necrosis (Table 2). Staining of the histology samples with Oil red-O, a classic lipid stain, confirmed the presence of FMs within the granulomatous structures in six out of seven samples presenting necrosis (Figure 1B), whereas no FMs were found in the three non-necrotic lesions (Table 2). Noteworthy, in samples with necrotic areas, FMs were always found in the interface region flanking the central necrosis (Figure 1B). These observations firstly confirmed the presence of FMs in most TB <span class="yellow">patients</span>' lesions thereby suggesting that these cells play an important role in the formation/maintenance of such lesions. Second, FMs seem to be associated with necrosis, which is a hallmark of TB lesions, since they were observed only in lesions with a necrotic center and preferentially located around the necrotic area.
Interestingly, staining, in parallel, of serial thin sections from a <span class="yellow">patient</span>'s lesion biopsy with Oil red-O (Figure 1C) and Ziehl Nielsen (Figure 1D), showed that most of the bacilli (arrow) were located in the same area as FMs, thus suggesting a strong association between the persisting tubercle bacilli and FMs within granulomas.<br><br><span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span> induces the formation of FMs within in vitro <span class="yellow">human</span> tuberculous granulomas
To further characterize the role of FMs in the granulomatous response, we assessed whether FM formation in granulomatous structures was triggered only by pathogenic mycobacterial species (<span class="yellow">M.tb</span>), or by low virulent ones (<span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>) as well. PBMCs from non-tuberculous control individuals were infected with <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> or <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>, following the procedure previously described for the induction of granulomatous structures ([7],[9] and Figure S1). Granuloma cells collected at days 3 and 11 were stained with Oil red-O to visualize the lipid droplets within FMs under the light microscope (Figure 2). At day 3, several <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>-induced granuloma cells already showed lipid bodies (Figure 2A). In contrast, the cells collected from <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>-induced granulomas were seldom (5%) positively stained (Figure 2B). Interestingly, <span class="yellow">M. avium</span> induced FM formation in a similar way to <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> (not shown). By day 11, the amount of positively stained cells had increased in <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>-induced granulomas, but not in <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>-induced ones. In addition, the number of lipid bodies per cell increased dramatically with time, as depited in the enlarged views (Figures 2A, C). The quantitative evaluation of the percentage of FMs within granulomas induced by both strains confirmed the differences observed under the light microscope, and showed a seven-fold difference (44% vs 6% respectively) between <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> and <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span> in terms of their ability to induce FM formation (Figure 2D). Our results therefore show that virulent species such as <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> and <span class="yellow">M. avium</span>, contrary to poorly or avirulent ones such as <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>, are able to induce the formation of FMs within our experimental model.<br><br>Oxygenated mycolic acids induce the maturation of macrophages into FMs
Mycolic acids from <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> incorporated into liposomes were recently shown to trigger the differentiation of <span class="blue">mice</span> peritoneal macrophages into foamy-like cells [21]. Interestingly, both <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> and <span class="yellow">M. avium</span>, which induce FM formation, express a family of oxygenated mycolic acids, especially ketomycolic acids, which are not produced by <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span> (Figure 3A). In this context, inactivation of the <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> hma gene (mmaA4-Rv0642c) was shown to abolish the synthesis of oxygenated keto- and hydroxyl-mycolic acid in the mutant strain [17]. Conversely, transforming <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span> with the hma gene induced the production of both keto- and hydroxyl-mycolic acids [22], (Figures 3B, C).
In the light of both data, we anticipated that oxygenated mycolic acids specifically produced by <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> and <span class="yellow">M. avium</span>, under the control of hma, are responsible for FM formation within <span class="yellow">human</span> granulomas. To test this hypothesis, we compared FM formation after infection of PBMCs with either the wild-type, or the hma-expressing <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span> strain (<span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>/hma). Granulomas cells were collected 3 days later and stained with Oil red-O to visualize lipid bodies. Wild-type <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>-induced granulomas displayed only 5.5% of FM, whereas the hma gene-expressing strain induced granulomas bearing a majority (67%) of brightly stained Oil red-O positive cells (Figures 4A, B, C). Induction of FM formation was even greater if isolated macrophages were directly infected with either strain. After only 4 hours of infection, <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>/hma had already transformed 64% of the infected macrophages into lipid body-positive cells (see Figure S2 for Nile red positive cells), whereas only 9% of the cells contained lipid bodies after infection with the wild-type strain (Figures 4D, E, F). To confirm the specific role of hma-dependent oxygenated mycolic acids in FM formation, and to rule out a possible combined effect of oxygenated mycolic-acids with other mycobacterial components, mycolic acids isolated from wild-type <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span> or <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>/hma were incubated with isolated macrophages. With mycolic acids isolated from the wild-type strain, only 13% of the macrophages were transformed into FM whereas 66% of the macrophages incubated with mycolic acids isolated from <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>/hma were strongly stained for lipid bodies (Figures 4G, H, I).
These results therefore indicate that oxygenated mycolic acids play a leading role in <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>-induced FM formation.<br><br>The phagocytic and bactericidal activities are arrested in FMs
To assess the function of granuloma FM, we first evaluated the ability of such cells to mediate phagocytosis. For this purpose, macrophages isolated from PBMCs were exposed to <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>/hma-derived mycolic acids to induce FM formation. Two days later, the cell population contained a mixture of FM (50–70%) and macrophages (30–50%), as assessed by Nile red staining (not shown). The mixed cell population was infected with FITC-labelled <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>. Intracellular bacilli were found only within Nile red-negative macrophages thereby indicating that FMs are unable to ingest bacteria (Figure 5A). This result was reproduced using other mycobacterial strains, such as <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> and <span class="yellow">M. bovis BCG</span>, for infection (not shown). These results further suggest that the bacilli found in granuloma FMs were internalized by macrophages prior to their transformation into FMs.
To assess whether FMs are able to develop a respiratory burst, which is a major intracellular bactericidal activity, the ability of Nile red positive cells (i.e. FMs) to mediate NBT reduction was determined. As shown in Figure 5D, only 8% of the NBT-positive cells (Figure 5B) were Nile red positive FMs (Figure 5C). This strongly suggests that once macrophages have differentiated into FMs, they lose the ability to mediate intracellular bactericidal activity. We postulate that FMs could, therefore, form a secure reservoir for the tubercle bacilli.<br><br><span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span> persists in a dormant non-replicative state in FMs
To evaluate the validity of the above hypothesis, we analyzed the ability of <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> to replicate within FMs. For this purpose, isolated macrophages were infected with <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>. At selected intervals post-infection, the amount of bacilli per cell was compared in both non-differentiated macrophages and FMs (Figure 5E). Until day 6, <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> replicated in a similar fashion in both cell types. In contrast, after day 6 post-infection, the amount of bacilli remained stationary in FMs, whereas it continued to increase in macrophages. It is interesting to note that arrest of bacterial replication coincided with completion of macrophage differentiation into FM, i.e. starting from day 3 post-infection. Our data suggest, that the bacilli found in granuloma FMs were internalized by macrophages prior to their differentiation into FMs and also that bacilli can terminate their replication cycle while macrophages are being transformed into FM, but that replication comes to a halt as soon as the maturation process is complete.
We next determined whether the non-replicative bacilli observed in FMs were still alive. For this purpose, we analyzed the expression of a series of genes known to be up-regulated when bacilli are in a persistent non-replicating state [23],[24]. RNA was, therefore, prepared from both in vitro-grown <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> and intracellular bacilli at day 6 and 12 post-infection. The respective amounts of RNA corresponding to isocitrate lyase, α-cristallin, a very hypothetical 7.6 kDa protein, CHP and DosR proteins were then quantified by RT-PCR. As shown in Table 3, the dormancy genes were all strongly up-regulated in intracellular bacilli at day 12 post-infection. These results further demonstrate that the bacilli are not killed in FMs, but rather persist in a dormant, and therefore non-replicative stage [25]. Interestingly, the dormancy genes were not as strongly expressed at day 6, time at which bacteria were still able to replicate in macrophages undergoing differentiation into FMs.<br><br>Characterization of <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> survival within FMs and interaction with lipid bodies
To gain further insight into the morphological appearance of <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> within FM and into the interactions between FM lipid bodies (LB) and <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>-containing phagosomes, granulomas were fixed and processed for conventional electron microscopy at days 3 and 11 post-infection.
Whatever the time point at which granuloma cells were observed, bacteria were all enclosed in phagosomes, most of which contained a single bacterium. None of them (over a thousand which were examined under the electron microscope) were free in the cytoplasm and only one was enclosed in a classical autophagic vacuole. At day 3 post-infection, FMs profiles (thin sections) were scarce, representing at most 9% of the total population of macrophage profiles observed under the electron microscope (Figure 6A). In addition, 86% of the FM profiles displayed at most 5 small LBs (Figure 6B). At this stage of granuloma formation, bacteria were infrequent in FM, but were found in other types of macrophages. One of these displayed large numbers of vacuoles containing flocculent material and often one or two LBs. Over 95% of the bacteria located in the different granuloma macrophages were morphologically intact, and therefore alive [26]. Intact bacteria present no breaks in the cell wall or cytoplasmic membrane and their cytoplasm has preserved its ultrastructural organization and electron opacity. Furthermore, they display no electron translucent intracytoplasmic lipid inclusions (ILI). Bacteria were also observed in between cells, probably as a result of cell lysis within granulomas. These bacteria were also morphologically intact and devoid of ILI (not shown).
At day 11 post-infection, <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>-containing macrophages displaying large numbers of vacuoles with flocculent material were less frequently observed. Interestingly, the amount of such vacuoles had strongly decreased in most of these cells while the number of LBs had increased. The percentage of FM had increased to reach 41% of the total population of macrophage profiles within the granulomas (Figure 6A). From these observations, it is tempting to assume that the highly vesiculated macrophages give rise to FMs. Within FMs, the size and amount of LBs had also increased with time since 48% of the FM profiles now displayed more than 5 LB per FM thin section (Figure 6B), randomly distributed within the cells (Figure 6C). About 30% of the FM profiles displayed between 1 and 20 bacteria, which were morphologically intact and enclosed within phagosomes (Figure 6C, enlarged view).
The interaction between these bacteria and the cellular LBs was next examined at day 11. Sixty percent of the bacilli were scattered throughout the FMs and displayed no obvious signs of interaction with the cellular LBs. A small fraction of the bacteria (21%), however, were observed in the close vicinity of cellular LBs. The membrane of the phagosomes in which they were enclosed clearly interacted with cellular LBs (Figures 6C, 7A, 7B, arrows) and became tightly apposed to an increasingly larger surface area of the LB. As a result, the phagosomes started to surround LBs in a zippering fashion (Figures 7E, F). Ultimately, bacilli (19%) were translocated to cellular LBs (Figure 7C). From these observations, it is tempting to assume that <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>-containing phagosomes engulf cellular LBs rather than fusing with them. This process, which is reminiscent of autophagy, resulted in the transfer of free bacteria into the lumen of cellular LBs (Figure 7C), some of which displayed up to 21 bacteria (Figure 7G). Interestingly, only altered <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> found within FM lipid bodies exhibited electron translucent ILIs (Figures 7D, G), thereby suggesting that they are able to accumulate host cell lipids. In previous work, the term altered bacteria had been used to define live bacteria that had acquired ILIs [26]. Since the presence of ILIs within the cytoplasm of <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> is typical for non-replicating bacteria in a state of dormancy [27], this further confirms that these bacteria are dormant.<br><br>
Discussion
Studies carried out several decades ago suggested that postprimary tuberculosis starts as a lipid pneumonia [28],[29]. Indeed, following a first inflammatory process leading to exudates of mononuclear cells within alveolar spaces, early pathologists observed an accumulation of lipid droplets in alveolar macrophages of TB <span class="yellow">patients</span>. Tubercle bacilli were shown to reside in these lipid-rich macrophages which were named foamy macrophages (FMs) [30]. Recently, histo-pathological analysis of biopsies from <span class="yellow">patients</span> with untreated tuberculosis confirmed the century-old histological descriptions of postprimary tuberculosis [10]. In this study, Hunter et al showed that postprimary tuberculosis begins as a lipid pneumonia with the accumulation of large amounts of lipid-rich FMs, accompanied by bronchial obstruction. It was also shown that in alveolar foamy macrophages, the bacilli were mainly found within lipid droplets. All these observations underline the important, yet often neglected, role of lipid accumulation, and more precisely FM formation, at the infectious site in the physiopathology of TB.
In <span class="yellow">murine</span> experimental models, FMs accumulate within the outermost layer of granulomatous structures occupying the alveolar spaces during the chronic phase of infection. This strongly suggests that FMs could be involved in lesion cleaning via phagocytic uptake of cellular debris generated by the local inflammatory response. Once filled with debris, FMs would leave the parenchyma through the alveolar spaces up to the superior bronchial tree, to be finally swallowed and digested in the stomach [31]. In fact, this process is very well known, and is a crucial factor for TB diagnosis in <span class="yellow">children</span>. As <span class="yellow">infants</span> do not usually generate cavitary lesions, and because it is difficult to detect bacilli in the sputum, the diagnosis is linked to the detection of bacilli in the gastrointestinal lavage [32].
We show that <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>-induced the transformation of in vitro-grown <span class="yellow">human</span> granuloma macrophages into FMs within 6 days, and even more rapidly (3–4 hours) in cultured macrophages. Although this event occurs more quickly than in vivo, or in animal models, our data are consistent with the above in vivo observations. Within FMs, bacilli and LBs were often tightly linked, to the point that a non-negligible amount of bacteria were ultimately observed within LBs. Interestingly, some of the bacilli transferred into lipid bodies displayed their own intracytoplasmic lipid inclusions, which are considered to be one of the hallmarks of non-replicating (dormant) <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> [27]. The recent observation of persistent ILI-containing tubercle bacilli within adipocyte LBs [33] is in good agreement with our observations. Since bacilli residing in phagosomes that do not interact with cellular lipid bodies do not display ILIs, it is tempting to assume that lipids within ILIs are of cellular origin. The accumulation of lipids within bacilli [47], via interaction with FM lipid bodies could, therefore, be crucial to <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> persistence. It is indeed known that <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> accumulates lipids, and more precisely triacylglycerols, during dormancy [34],[35] from which it derives both carbon and energy for its own metabolism. Intracellular persistence of <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> is also critically linked to the acquisition of host cholesterol through the Mce4 transporter system [36].
The question that arises is how do bacteria gain access to lipids from LB? Direct fusion of phagosomes with FM lipid bodies seems unlikely as the membranes of both structures are quite different from one another. Our observations suggest instead that once <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>-containing phagosomes have established close contact with a lipid body, they surround and engulf the latter by a process that remains to be deciphered. This phenomenon is somewhat reminiscent of autophagy, as observed under conditions of cholesterol depletion in macrophages infected with <span class="yellow">M. avium</span> [37]. After degradation of the resulting inner membrane, bacteria would be freed within the lipids of the engulfed LB, and therefore be in direct contact with cellular lipids. How bacilli translocate the cellular lipids to their own cytoplasm remains to be established.
Another important phenomenon underlined by our study is the strong correlation between the presence of FMs in the granulomatous structures and the development of necrosis within the lesion, as suggested by Pagel over 80 years ago [29]. Interestingly, FMs were systematically located at the interface region between the histiocytes and the central necrosis area of the biopsied lesions. Although necrosis formation could depend on an indirect effect of the global immune response, our data indicate that the formation of FMs is an important factor favoring the appearance of necrosis. Analysis of larger series of biopsy samples are, however, needed to definitely demonstrate our actual hypothesis according to which FMs play a direct and unique role in necrosis formation. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that FMs induced from <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>-infected macrophages displayed permanent TNF-α secretion, a potent pro-necrotic factor, whereas <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>-infected macrophages were poor producers of TNF-α. At day 4 post-infection, TNF-α secretion was indeed twofold higher in macrophages (of which 70% had differentiated into FMs) infected with <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> than in those infected with <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>, as measured both by ELISA and RNA quantification (Peyron, unpublished observations). However, one must keep in mind that the association of FMs and necrosis may be the consequence of the FM cleaning process of lipoproteins released into the necrotic tissue, as observed in atherosclerosis lesions [38]. It is thus tempting to propose that <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> mycolic acids may be responsible for the development of necrotic lesions, due to their ability to induce TNF-α production by FMs. Whether mycolic acids are directly involved in TNF-α production, or only indirectly by inducing FM formation, remains a matter of debate currently under study.
Our observations are strikingly similar to the phenomena described for postprimary tuberculosis, that seems to begin as localized foci of pneumonia followed by massive necrosis leading to the formation of pulmonary cavities [10]. If this proves to be the case, then the traditionally admitted phenomenon of cavitation arising from the erosion of caseating granulomatous structures from bronchi can be ruled out [39]. In our study, we successfully induced FM formation from isolated macrophages infected with <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>, i.e. outside a granulomatous structure, which is consistent with Hunter's recent proposal.
Until now, mycolic acids have been considered to be indirectly involved in virulence mechanisms as being part of complex molecules of the mycobacterial envelope. The most widely studied mycolic acid-containing mycobacterial compound trehalose 6,6′ dimycolate (TDM), has been extensively analyzed for its role in virulence since the mid-fifties [40]. Recently, it was shown to interfere with the host granulomatous response [41]. Overall, TDM was mainly shown to mediate macrophage activation and a Th1-type response to <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> infection (for review, see [25]).
Our results demonstrate a direct role of oxygenated mycolic acids for FM formation, independently from the appearance and stage of the disease. <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>-specific mycolic acids indeed trigger the transformation of both isolated and granuloma macrophages, into FM. Given the absence of FM formation in <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span>-induced granulomas, despite the induction of a comparative inflammatory response, ascertained by the similar induction of granulomas, this phenomenon clearly depends upon a direct contact with the bacilli, and not to the inflammatory response. Mycolic acids are major and hallmark components of the mycobacterial cell wall. They constitute 40–60% of dry weight of the envelope [42]. All members of the complex (e.g. <span class="yellow">M.tb</span>, <span class="yellow">Mycobacterium africanum</span>, <span class="yellow">Mycobacterium bovis</span> and <span class="yellow">Mycobacterium microti</span>) are able to synthesize the same combination of mycolic acids, i.e. cyclopropanated α-mycolic acids, ketomycolic and methoxymycolic acids [17], which are not synthesized by non-pathogenic mycobacterial species [43]. These structural specificities probably account for part of the pathogenicity of these species, as shown by the impaired virulence of mutant strains deprived of keto and methoxyl groups in experimental infections [17],[44],[45].
Our study, therefore, gives the first proof of a direct role of isolated mycolic acids in the interplay between <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> and host cells. Interestingly, this effect is expressed both by whole bacilli and isolated lipids, suggesting that oxygenated mycolic acids are either secreted by the bacilli, or exposed at the cell wall surface in a manner enabling their bioactivity. According to our results, mycolic acids trigger the formation, within granulomas, of FMs in which bacilli can hide and survive. Oxygenated mycolic acids, either free, as constituents of TDM [44], or linked to the cell wall arabinogalactan [46],[47], should, therefore, be considered as major virulence factors enabling <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> survival for long periods of time in a persistent state. Being an inducer of host lipid accumulation, and FM formation at the site of infection, these oxygenated mycolic acids could, therefore, also be responsible for the induction of necrosis within lesions, thus favoring <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> dissemination.
Interestingly, deletion of the mmaA4 (Rv0642c) gene also drastically decreased the ability of <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> to induce the differentiation of macrophages into FMs (data not shown). However, the residual ability of this mutant to induce FMs suggests that other mycobacterial factors might partially trigger the formation of FM. With regard to the mycolic acid methyltransferases, given that (i) mmaA2 (Rv0644c) and mmaA3 (Rv0643c) are pseudogenes in <span class="yellow">M. leprae</span> and (ii) mmaA4 KO present no trans cyclopropanation [45], thus excluding the involvement of the cmaA2 (Rv0503c) gene, we expect that at least pcaA (Rv0470c), which introduces cis-cyclopropane, may play the same role. Consistent with this hypothesis, a pcaA null mutant is unable to persist within infected <span class="blue">mice</span> [46], thus demonstrating the role of a mycolic acid methyltransferase in the chronic stage of infection.
Overall, our study has shed light on a previously uncharacterized cell population participating in <span class="yellow">human</span> tuberculous granulomas, namely foamy macrophages. We propose that the specific induction of FM by <span class="yellow">M.tb</span> would create a favourable environment for persistent bacteria. In our opinion, FMs could be a safe shelter because they preserve bacilli from a direct contact with granuloma lymphocytes and histiocytes, they lose one of the major macrophage bactericidal activities and they constitute an important source of nutrients for the bacilli thanks to the fatty acids accumulated in their lipid granules.<br><br>Supporting Information<br><br>
<h3>pmcA2652712</h3>Neurogenin2 Directs Granule Neuroblast Production and Amplification while NeuroD1 Specifies Neuronal Fate during Hippocampal Neurogenesis
Abstract
The specification and differentiation of dentate gyrus granule neurons in the hippocampus require temporally and spatially coordinated actions of both intrinsic and extrinsic molecules. The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Neurogenin2 (Ngn2) and NeuroD1 are key regulators in these processes. Based on existing classification, we analyzed the molecular events occurring during hippocampal neurogenesis, primarily focusing on juvenile animals. We found that Ngn2 is transiently expressed by late type-2a amplifying progenitors. The Ngn2 progenies mature into hippocampal granule neurons. Interestingly, the loss of Ngn2 at early stages of development leads to a robust reduction in neurogenesis, but does not disturb granule neuron maturation per se. We found that the role of Ngn2 is to maintain progenitors in an undifferentiated state, allowing them to amplify prior to their maturation into granule neurons upon NeuroD1 induction. When we overexpressed Ngn2 and NeuroD1 in vivo, we found NeuroD1 to exhibit a more pronounced neuron-inductive effect, leading to granule neuron commitment, than that displayed by Ngn2. Finally, we observed that all markers expressed during the transcriptional control of hippocampal neurogenesis in rodents are also present in the <span class="yellow">human</span> hippocampus. Taken together, we demonstrate a critical role of for Ngn2 and NeuroD1 in controlling neuronal commitment and hippocampal granule neuroblast formation, both during embryonic development and in post-natal hippocampal granule neurogenesis.<br><br>Introduction
Neurons are born not only during development of the central nervous system, but neurogenesis also continues into adulthood. In both <span class="yellow">rodent</span> and <span class="yellow">human</span> adult brain, neurogenesis is active in two distinct zones of the forebrain: the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) [1]–[5]. The molecular mechanism underlying neurogenesis in the DG is not fully understood. Clearly, a cascade of transcriptional events controls the specification of neuronal identity in the DG [3], [6]–[8], but details of the expression pattern and function of each transcription factor remain elusive.
The paired-box homeodomain transcription factor Pax6 and the bHLH transcription factors Ngn2 and NeuroD1 are important when cells acquire a pan-neuronal character and a specific neuronal subtype [9], [10]. In the developing neocortex, Pax6 is expressed in dividing radial glial cells at the ventricular surface [9]. In the adult hippocampus, Pax6 is expressed in astrocytes in the SGZ and are considered to be the true stem cells [9], [11]. Loss- and gain-of-function studies indicate that Pax6 is involved in regulating the proliferation of neocortical and hippocampal progenitors [9], [12]–[16]. During neocorticogenesis, high concentrations of Pax6 induce the expression of the bHLH transcription factor Neurogenin2 (Ngn2) [17]. In turn, Ngn2 causes cell cycle exit [18], an event that takes place when NeuroD1 starts to be expressed [19]. In the developing hippocampus, the absence of Ngn2 leads to a reduced number of granule neurons [20]. NeuroD1, on the other hand, is essential for the differentiation and survival of hippocampal granule neurons [10]. Interestingly, in the absence of Ngn2, NeuroD1 can still be activated and neuronal differentiation can still take place [20]. This has led to the idea that the primary role of Ngn2 is not to direct neuronal differentiation.
Only a small number of studies have addressed the role of Ngn2 and NeuroD1 in hippocampal neurogenesis [10], [20], [21]. Therefore, we now re-examine their roles in hippocampal neurogenesis in detail, using gain- and loss-of-function experiments. We first establish a hierarchy of transcriptional events that occur during neurogenesis in the DG and then define the place that Ngn2, NeuroD1 and other transcription factors have in this cascade. We find that a lack of Ngn2 expression result in a markedly smaller hippocampus and an almost complete absence of the DG. We show that Ngn2 is required for granule neuroblasts production/amplification. Gain-of-function of NeuroD1 during development of the DG results in an efficient generation of granule neuroblasts, an effect that we do not observe when we overexpress Ngn2. Finally, we demonstrate that the same transcription factors and cellular markers seen in <span class="yellow">mouse</span> and <span class="yellow">rat</span> tissue are also present in the <span class="yellow">human</span> hippocampus.<br><br>Results
Expression of transcription factors and cellular markers define different phases of postnatal hippocampal granule neuron maturation
We first analyzed in detail the chronology of expression of different transcription factors and cell-specific markers during DG granule neuron formation and correlated our findings to the previously established classification of adult hippocampal neurogenesis [3]. The current classification describes hippocampal stem cells and progenies into three categories (type-1, -2 and -3 cells) depending on the markers they express as they mature. In the adult <span class="yellow">mouse</span> DG, only a very small proportion of cells undergo mitosis at any one given time [22]. Consequently, in adult animals it is difficult to analyze which transcription factors are involved in the transition phase from one cell category to the next. Therefore, we studied 2 week-old rodents which have higher numbers of maturing granule neurons in the DG. We performed triple immunohistochemistry for all markers of interest and compared results from 2 week- and 2 month-old <span class="blue">mice</span> (Figure 1 and figure S1).
We first confirmed that stem cells in the SGZ exhibit characteristics of radial glia [3], [11], [16]. They extend radial processes from the SGZ to the apex of the subgranular layer (SGL) and the basal molecular layer. Moreover, they express the intermediate filament protein nestin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and glial glutamate transporter (GLAST) [16] (Figure 1A and B and figure S1A and S1B). The GFAP- and GLAST+ cells are defined as type-1 cells [3]. They also express the paired-homeodomain transcription factor Pax6 (Figure 1B). These radial glia-like stem cells divide relatively infrequently, and are believed to undergo symmetric division (giving rise to two identical stem cells) under some conditions. They can also divide asymmetrically and give rise to a new stem cell and one neuronal progenitor, which usually is defined as a type-2 cell (Figure 2B) [3].
Type-2 cells are divided into two different populations: type-2a expressing nestin and type-2b co-expressing nestin and doublecortin (Dcx) [23]. Based on a previous report [24], we examined the expression pattern of the T-domain transcription factors Tbr1 and Tbr2. We found that Tbr2 is expressed in type-2a cells, in agreement with a recent report [25]. In the SGZ of 2 week-old <span class="blue">mice</span>, we found an average of 50–70 Tbr2+ cells per 30 µm-thick section throughout the rostro-caudal axis of the dorsal hippocampus. This number was reduced by 35% in 2 month-old <span class="blue">mice</span> (Figure 1C with figure S1C and data not shown). As opposed to Tbr1 (Figure 1D and figure S1D), Tbr2+ cells did not co-express Dcx or PSA-NCAM (Figure 1C and figure S1C). We observed that Tbr1-immuoreactivity gradually decreased as neurons matured and started to express NeuN (Figure 1H and figure S1H). Thus, Tbr2 labels type-2 cells, while Tbr1 is expressed by immature granule neurons.
We then examined the molecular phenotype of type-3 cells, a cell type that transiently expresses Calretinin [26]. We hypothesized that hippocampal type-3 cells might also express the bHLH transcription factor NeuroD1, known to partially overlap with Tbr2 and Tbr1 in different brain regions [24]. We found that NeuroD1 expression in the hippocampus starts in Tbr2+ cells and extends to post-mitotic Tbr1+ cells, which also express the hippocampal granule identity transcription factor Prox1 (Figure 1G and 1I and figure S1G and S1I). While Tbr1 expression ceases during granule maturation, that of NeuroD1 is weakly maintained when NeuN expression starts (Figure 1G and 1H and figure S1G and S1H). We found that calretinin expression decreased during granule neuron maturation, before NeuroD1 was reduced (Figure 1F). Thus NeuroD1 is expressed in type-2b and type-3 cells, as well as immature granule neurons. Finally, we found that NeuroD2 starts to be expressed just after NeuroD1 and, unlike NeuroD1, continues to be highly expressed in mature neurons (Figure 1J and data not shown).<br><br>Mash1 and Ngn2 define the early versus late type-2a stage in 2 weeks old <span class="blue">mice</span>
Having established the hierarchy of transcription factors and cellular markers appearing during hippocampal neurogenesis, we set out to clarify the position of the two bHLH transcription factors Ngn2 and Mash1, in this process. We found that more than 90% of Ngn2-immunoreactive cells are Pax6 positive (Figure 2A), and almost all co-express Tbr2 (Figure 2B). Thus, Ngn2 appears to be expressed by type-2a cells. As our antibodies against Ngn2 and NeuroD1 were made in the same species, we could not determine if there was an overlap between these two proteins. However, by comparing their overlapping expression pattern with that of Tbr2, we propose that some Ngn2+ cells co-express NeuroD1, and that they appear at the onset of NeuroD1 expression and downregulation of Ngn2. We base this assumption on the facts that more than 50% of the Tbr2+ cells are Ngn2+ and more than 50% of Tbr2+ cells also express NeuroD1. The expression of Ngn2 in adult hippocampus was hard to detect using immunohistochemistry due to the low expression of the protein (data not shown). However, it is present, as previously described using reporter <span class="blue">mice</span> and as revealed by in situ hybridization [21].
We next examined the expression of Mash1 and compared it with that of Ngn2, Pax6 and Tbr2. We found some Mash1+ cells (10–20 cells per section) in the dorsal hippocampus. Almost all of them co-expressed Pax6 (Figure 2C). Only few cells co-expressed Tbr2 (Figure 2D) or Ngn2 (Figure 2E), suggesting that Mash1 is downregulated when these two proteins are expressed. None of the Mash1-expressing cells were positive for NeuroD1 (Figure 2F). Mash1+ cells were still undergoing mitosis (Figure 2C) and consequently over 90% of them co-labeled with the cell-cycle marker Ki67 (Figure S1J).
Taken together, we show that Mash1 and Ngn2 are expressed in early and late stages of maturation of type2a progenitors, respectively, and that both transcription factors are co-expressed briefly when cells transit from early to late phase type2a cells.<br><br>Ngn2 progenies become hippocampal granule neurons
Previous work has shown that in Mash1 null mutant <span class="blue">mice</span> hippocampal neurogenesis is not reduced and the hippocampus is not malformed [20]. Therefore we focused our initial analysis on the role of Ngn2 in hippocampal neurogenesis. We characterized the fate of Ngn2-expressing cells using Ngn2 Knock-in green fluorescent protein (GFP) <span class="blue">mice</span> (Ngn2+/GFP) [27]. In the SGZ of 2 week-old hippocampi, we found bright GFP-expressing cells that were positive for Tbr2 (Figure 2H), the immature neuronal marker PSA-NCAM (Figure 2I) and NeuroD1 (Figure 2J). Furthermore, Prox1+, NeuroD2+ and calretinin+ cells were also weakly positive for GFP. We made similar observations in 2 month-old <span class="blue">mice</span> (data not shown) confirming earlier published results [21]). We did not observe Mash1+/GFP+ and NeuN+/GFP+ cells (Figure 2G). These data from Ngn2+/GFP <span class="blue">mice</span> are entirely consistent with our earlier observations using immunocytochemistry to label Ngn2-expressing cells and with GFP undergoing slow degradation after the expression of Ngn2 has ceased. Importantly, none of the GFP-expressing cells, including those only weakly fluorescent, residing in the SGL expressed the astrocytic marker GFAP or the oligodendrocytic markers CNPase (data not shown). Taken together, the data show that Ngn2 progenies become neurons and never generate astrocytes or oligodendrocytes.<br><br>Marked reduction of hippocampal granule neurons in absence of Ngn2
To determine the role of Ngn2 during the initiation of hippocampal granule neurogenesis, we analyzed the hippocampus of <span class="blue">mice</span> lacking Ngn2 (Ngn2GFP/GFP). In contrast to the <span class="blue">mice</span> use by Galichet and coworkers, our <span class="blue">mice</span> have a lifespan of only 2 weeks after birth. Therefore, we analyzed 2 week-old and younger <span class="blue">mice</span>. Consistent with previous observations [20], the hippocampus in Ngn2GFP/GFP mutants is clearly malformed (Figure 3A). In two week-old Ngn2GFP/GFP <span class="blue">mice</span>, the ventral blade of the DG is completely absent. Already on postnatal day 1–2, the ventral blade of the DG is malformed along its whole rostro-caudal axis (Figure 3B).
As neither migration defects nor cell death cause the reduced number of hippocampal neurons in Ngn2 null <span class="blue">mice</span> [20], we asked if Ngn2 is necessary for production of hippocampal granule neuroblasts. We first injected 2 day-old <span class="yellow">mouse</span> pups with BrdU 2 hours prior to sacrifice, allowing us to evaluate cell proliferation and ongoing neurogenesis. We also injected BrdU into female <span class="blue">mice</span> on their final day of pregnancy and examined the brains of their pups 48 hours later (corresponding to P1–P2 old pups). This allowed us to assess the number of neurons derived from the last day of intrauterine development. Regardless of whether the <span class="blue">mice</span> were WT or hetero/homozygous mutant pups, we found cells that had incorporated BrdU in the hippocampal subventricular zone (hSVZ), fimbria and the DG (Figure 4A and B; [28]), suggesting that progenitors originating in the hSVZ divide while migrating towards the DG. Most of them were organized in chains typical of migrating cells (Figure 4A and B and figure S2). In Ngn2GFP/GFP mutant <span class="blue">mice</span> injected with BrdU 2 hours prior to sacrifice, we observed a decrease in the number of BrdU+ cells compared to heterozygous littermates. Thus, the numbers of newborn cells were reduced in the hSVZ/fimbria (133.3±7.5 for Ngn2+/GFP vs 69.7±5.0 for Ngn2GFP/GFP) and DG (132.0±9.1 for Ngn2+/GFP vs 42.6±2.2 for Ngn2GFP/GFP)(Figure 4C and D). We also examined the number of newborn cells differentiating into neurons, and identified them by the co-expression of BrdU and NeuroD1. As expected, they were relatively few in numbers because the short delay (2 hours) between BrdU administration and sacrifice in this first experimental paradigm. In Ngn2GFP/GFP null mutants, we found the number of cells differentiating into neurons to be reduced by 60% and 71% in the hSVZ/fimbria (8.6±1.4 for Ngn2+/GFP vs 3.4±0.5 for Ngn2GFP/GFP) and DG (9.7±1.1 for Ngn2+/GFP vs 2.8±0.6 for Ngn2GFP/GFP), respectively, (Figure 4E and F). As a result, the number of NeuroD1+ cells in the DG was reduced by 80% (580.3±27.7 for Ngn2+/GFP vs 116.2±7.3 for Ngn2GFP/GFP; Figure 4G).
We obtained similar results in the second paradigm, i.e. in <span class="blue">mice</span> that we sacrificed 48 hours after BrdU administration and in which a larger number of the newborn cells had time to mature into neurons. In this case, the number of BrdU+/NeuroD1+ cells in the DG was reduced by 73% of Ngn2GFP/GFP mutant animals (91.5±24.1 for Ngn2+/GFP vs 26.4±3.3 for Ngn2GFP/GFP) (Figure 4J). We found no differences in the proportion of BrdU+ cells that expressed NeuroD1 in Ngn2+/GFP and Ngn2GFP/GFP <span class="blue">mice</span> (14.2±1.0% and 17.4±1.8% respectively; Figure 4K). This shows that the few cells that manage to proliferate in the Ngn2 null <span class="blue">mice</span> have the same ability to differentiate into neurons as those in <span class="blue">mice</span> with one Ngn2 allele.
Interestingly, the absence of Ngn2 did not alter the identity of neurons in the DG granule layer in 2 week-old Ngn2 null <span class="blue">mice</span>. The maturing granule progenitors sequentially expressed Pax6, Tbr2 (Figure S3A and S3B), NeuroD1 and Calretinin (Figure 4L), PSA-NCAM (Figure 4N), Tbr1 (data not shown) and Prox1 (Figure 4M). We confirmed that the same transcriptional cascade is active in the 20% (compared to <span class="blue">mice</span> with one Ngn2 allele) residual granule neurons that are formed two day-old in Ngn2GFP/GFP <span class="blue">mice</span> (Figure S3D–G and data not shown).
We next investigated if the cells that failed to develop into neurons in Ngn2GFP/GFP mutant <span class="blue">mice</span>, became glial cells. We found that cells expressing GFP never co-labeled with the astrocyte marker GFAP (Figure 4N) or the oligodendrocyte marker CNPase (data not shown).
Altogether, our results show that Ngn2 plays an important role during the production/amplification of hippocampal granule neuroblasts, but not the acquisition of the granule neuron identity (Figure S7).<br><br>Ngn2 controls the amplification of granule neuron progenitors
We next monitored the mitogenic activity of Ngn2+ cells in the DG of 2 week-old WT <span class="blue">mice</span>. We observed that over 50% of Ngn2+ cells in the DG of WT <span class="blue">mice</span> co-expressed the mitosis marker Ki67 (Figure 5A). Inspired by this finding, we injected BrdU into 2 week-old WT and Ngn2GFP/GFP <span class="blue">mice</span> and compared cell proliferation in the DG. We observed 92% reduction in number of proliferating cells in the SGZ of Ngn2 null mutant <span class="blue">mice</span> (6.7±0.5) compared to WT (83.6±1.2) and heterozygotic (data not shown) littermates (Figure 5B–C). This data confirm the importance of Ngn2 during the amplification of granule progenitor.s.
To further explore whether Ngn2+ cells become post-mitotic or still proliferate after Ngn2 is downregulated, we performed immunohistochemistry on sections through the DG of Ngn2+/GFP <span class="blue">mice</span>. We stained them with the mitosis marker Phospho-histone 3 (PH3) and NeuroD1, which is downstream of Ngn2 in the transcriptional cascade controlling neurogenesis. Thus, in the same sections we could identify whether cells that had initiated Ngn2 expression (GFP labeled), continued to divide (PH3+) or committed to neuronal differentiation (NeuroD1+). We observed some GFP+ cells that co-expressed PH3. They all exhibited morphological characteristics of one of the five mitotic phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase and cytokinesis (Figure 5D and data not shown). Unexpectedly, cells that colabeled for GFP, PH3 and NeuroD1 (Figure 5E and figure S4A and S4B) were rare. This indicates that Ngn2+ cells undergo division/amplification and that they mature into post-mitotic neurons upon NeuroD1 expression. In <span class="blue">mice</span> lacking Ngn2, we found the cells expressing GFP localized to the malformed ventral blade of the DG (Figure 5F and G). All of these cells were Ki67+ and they only very rarely expressed PH3 (Figure 5F and G, and figure S4C) in the absence of Ngn2 most of the cells are arrested in the cell cycle prior to entering the M phase and their mitosis is impaired. These data suggest that the mechanism of action of Ngn2 is conserved from development of the DG to postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis.
Our findings suggest that Ngn2 regulates amplification and cell cycle exit of DG granule progenitors. To examine this hypothesis, we compared the effects of Ngn2 and NeuroD1 on mitotic activity in embryonic cortico-hippocampal neurosphere-derived progenitors, 5 days upon transduction, in vitro. In cultures transduced with Ngn2 retrovirus, we found that 27.2% (±4.1%) of the PH3+ cells had been transduced (Figure I1–J). These cells were immunopositive for MAP2 (Figure 5I1 and I2) and therefore represented dividing neuroblasts. By contrast, in NeuroD1 transduced cultures, only 7.3% of PH3+ cells were GFP+ (Figure 5H1, H2 and J). All of the NeuroD1-transduced cells became MAP2+ (Figure 5H). To confirm this data we pulse-labeled transduced cultures with chlorodeoxyuridine (CldU) for 48 hours, five days after differentiation. In contrast to NeuroD1-transduced cultures, we observed dividing cells transduced with Ngn2 retrovirus that were positive for PH3 and that had incorporated CldU (Figure 5K–L2). As the number of cells PH3+/CldU+/GFP+ we observed was low, we did not quantify this finding.
Collectively, we have shown that Ngn2 is required for granule neuroblast production and amplification and that in the absence of Ngn2 the progenitors arrest in the cell cycle. NeuroD1, on the other hand, induces cell cycle exit and promotes rapid neuronal maturation.<br><br>NeuroD1 directs neuronal differentiation and maturation
Based on our previous observations we proposed that Ngn2 primarily controls amplification of granule neuroblasts and NeuroD1 directs neuronal differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we overexpressed Ngn2 or NeuroD1 in E14.5 cortico-hippocampal neurospheres and compared their effects after 5 days of differentiation of the progenitors. All cortico-hippocampal progenitors expressed Pax6 prior to differentiation (Figure S5). After 5 days, both factors suppressed Pax6 and Sox2 (Figure S5, figure 6C) and induced expression of Tbr1, Map2, NeuroD1 and PSA-NCAM (Figure 6D and E).
Interestingly, all Ngn2-overexpressing cells co-expressed NeuroD1. Based on these findings, we next explored whether Ngn2 overexpression induces NeuroD1 expression, and if NeuroD1 in turn directs neuronal differentiation. We compared the effects of both transcription factors in progenitors that either do or do not normally express them. Thus, we expressed Ngn2 in E14.5 neural progenitors isolated from three different brain regions: cortex/hippocampus, lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) and ventral mesencephalon (VM). Ngn2 expression in the developing forebrain is normally limited to the neocortex, and it does not appear in LGE tissue [29]. In the developing VM, both Ngn2 and NeuroD1 are expressed, but not when neural progenitors from this region are cultured in vitro [30], [31]. In our experiments, cortico-hippocampal progenitors could differentiate into neurons, although they did not normally express NeuroD1 (Figure 6E). When we overexpressed Ngn2 in VM and LGE progenitors, the cells started to express both NeuroD1 and PSA-NCAM (Figure 6F and G). We then overexpressed NeuroD1 in the same types of cultured progenitors and found that the cells became immunoreactive for PSA-NCAM (Figure 6G and data not shown). Thus, NeuroD1 is sufficient to direct neuronal differentiation in cortico-hippocampal-, LGE- and VM-derived progenitors.
Our results from in vitro cultures and the analysis of the DG of Ngn2 mutant animals collectively show the neuron-inducing effect of NeuroD1 in hippocampal granule cell progenitors [32].<br><br>NeuroD1 directs exclusive neuronal differentiation of hippocampal granule neuron progenitors
As the next step, we tested the effects of NeuroD1 in vivo and compared them with those of Ngn2. We injected retroviruses carrying the gene for either Ngn2 [33] or NeuroD1, and the reporter gene eGFP into the ventricles E15.5 <span class="yellow">rat</span> embryos, in utero (Figure 7A). Three weeks later, when the <span class="yellow">rats</span> were about two weeks old, we examined their hippocampi and analyzed the eGFP+ cells. The <span class="yellow">rats</span> injected with control vector exhibited eGFP+ cells within the hippocampus that were either star-shaped, progenitor/glial-like cells (14.8±3.4%) or neuron-like cells with long neurites (85.3±3.4%) (Figure 7B). In <span class="yellow">rats</span> that we had injected with the vector encoding Ngn2, the eGFP-labeled, the transduced hippocampal cells were composed of 31.9% (±5.7%) progenitor/glia-like cells and 69.4% (±6.1%) neuron-like cells (Figure 7B). The glia-like subpopulation was immunopositive for the astrocytic marker GFAP (Figure 7C–D). In contrast, virtually all of the transduced cells in <span class="yellow">rats</span> injected with the NeuroD1 vector became neuron-like cells (99.9%±0.1; Figure 7B). None of these cells stained for GFAP (Figure 7E and F). They were positioned in the external layers of both the ventral and dorsal blades of the DG (Figure 7B3, E and I and figure S6A).
When we examined neuronal maturation of Ngn2- and NeuroD1-transduced cells, we observed that only a few of those transduced with the NeuroD1 vector expressed the early mature neuronal marker Tbr1 (3.1±1.4%; Figure 7I and J). They were located within the basal layers, near the SGL, of the ventral and dorsal blades of the DG. In contrast, a greater proportion of the cells transduced with Ngn2 still expressed Tbr1 (19.6%±3.3%; Figure 7H and J), indicating that they were less mature than the vast majority of the NeuroD1-transduced cells. Immunohistochemistry for NeuN confirmed these data (Figure 7M and O, and figure S6A). Indeed, when we overexpressed Ngn2 the proportion of hippocampal progenitors that became NeuN+ was no greater than in <span class="yellow">rats</span> transduced with the control virus (Figure 7F).
As a whole, our in utero injection experiments confirm that NeuroD1 has a stronger neuron-inducing effect than Ngn2 when overexpressed in hippocampal progenitors.<br><br>Involvement of Mash1, Ngn2, Tbr and NeuroD proteins during <span class="yellow">human</span> hippocampal neurogenesis
Finally, we examined whether the transcription factors and cellular markers that are expressed in rodents are also expressed in <span class="yellow">human</span> hippocampus. We performed immunohistochemistry on aged <span class="yellow">human</span> hippocampal DG and found GFAP-, Sox2-, Pax6-, Nestin-, Prox1- and NeuN-immunopositive cells. This indicates that radial glia-like stem cells, neural progenitors and mature granule neurons are present in the aged <span class="yellow">human</span> hippocampus (Figure 8A–E). While Prox1 is found mainly in granule neurons, Sox2 and Pax6 are exclusively localized to cells in the SGZ (Figure 8D and E).
As for aged rodents, we did not observe the presence of Mash1, Ngn2, Tbr2, Tbr1 and NeuroD1 proteins in aged <span class="yellow">human</span> hippocampus, using immunohistochemistry. However, we could identify the presence of the transcripts, using RT-PCR (Figure 8F). In addition, we detected mRNA for Prox1, Calbindin1 and Calbindin2/Calretinin (Figure 8F). Interestingly, we also observed Sonic Hedgehog and Wnt-3A transcripts, indicating that they are present in the <span class="yellow">human</span> DG and supporting previous claims that they are important for the regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (Figure 8F; [34], [35]). Finally, we also found mRNA for GLAST, Pax6 and GFAP which suggests that radial glia-like stem cells are present in the adult <span class="yellow">human</span> hippocampus, and may play a role in adult <span class="yellow">human</span> hippocampal neurogenesis (Figure 8F; [8]).
Overall, our data show that different proteins known to play key roles in <span class="yellow">rodent</span> hippocampal granule neurogenesis are present in the adult <span class="yellow">human</span> hippocampus.<br><br>
Discussion
In this study we determine the functions of Ngn2 and NeuroD1 during hippocampal neurogenesis. First, we map the hierarchy of molecular markers of neurogenesis in the DG. Second, we describe that Ngn2 is necessary for granule progenitor production/amplification. Third, we demonstrate that NeuroD1 directs neuronal differentiation of granule progenitors. Finally, we show that different cellular markers expressed during hippocampal neurogenesis in rodents are present in <span class="yellow">human</span>.
Sequential expression of different transcription factors and cellular markers during hippocampal neurogenesis
We clarified the pattern of expression of various markers expressed during postnatal and adult hippocampal granule neurogenesis in detail. We found that the transcription factor Pax6 is initially expressed by both radial glia stem cells (type-1) and early amplifying progenitors (type-2a). The next transcription factor to appear in chronology is Mash1. Mash1 expression characterizes the early stage of hippocampal progenitor amplification (early type-2a). The role of Mash1 during hippocampal granule neurogenesis is still unclear. Mash1 null mutant <span class="blue">mice</span> do not display any clear malformation of the DG [20]. However, overexpression of Mash1 alone in the DG leads to the generation of oligodendrocytes [36]. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that Mash1-expressing cells are not yet committed towards a granule cell fate. They may still have the potential to generate both neurons and oligodendrocytes, as is the case in the SVZ [37].
In agreement with different developing brain regions, we found that Ngn2 starts to be expressed in Mash1-positive transiently amplifying progenitors, i.e. “late type-2a cells” according to the classification we propose. We observed that Pax6 expression persisted longer than that of Mash1, in Ngn2-expressing cells (late type-2a cells), in juvenile but not adult DG (Fig. 1 and figure S1). Later on, Ngn2 is downregulated, whilst Tbr2 expression persists (type-2b cells). The transition from amplifying progenitor to neuroblast is defined by the expression of NeuroD1. Thus, Ngn2 is expressed at the beginning of the transiently amplifying progenitor phase while NeuroD1 marks the end of that period. This applies both to the juvenile and adult <span class="yellow">rat</span> brain [21], [25]. After NeuroD1 is turned on the progenitors leave the cell cycle, gradually mature, express PSA-NCAM, NeuroD2, Calretinin, Prox1, Tbr1 and, finally, NeuN. NeuroD1 expression persists at low levels in mature neurons (Figure 9; [10]). We found the sequential expression of these markers conserved in juvenile (P2 and 2 weeks) and adult <span class="yellow">rodent</span> brains. Importantly, we observed that the same transcription factors and neuronal markers are also present in the adult <span class="yellow">human</span> hippocampus and arranged spatially in a manner reminiscent with what we saw in rodents. It is possible, however, that some of these markers are expressed for longer or shorter periods at postnatal and adult stages of hippocampal progenitor maturation. Moreover, one can ask to which extent the number of divisions occurring during neuroblasts maturation is conserved at postnatal and adult stages of neurogenesis.<br><br>A new function for Ngn2 in maintenance of a progenitor state for granule neuron production/amplification during embryonic and postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis
In agreement with earlier work, we confirm that Ngn2 is indispensable for hippocampal development and plays a vital role in postnatal hippocampal granule neurogenesis. Ngn2 null mutant animals display a reduced size of the cornu ammonis and a malformed DG (Figure 3 and 4; [20]). We show that the number of newborn neurons (incorporated BrdU) is decreased in absence of Ngn2, but hippocampal granule neuron subtype specification is not affected, post-nataly. Likewise, neurons from other brain regions, e.g. ventral midbrain dopamine neurons, can be generated in the absence of Ngn2 [30], [31]. The reduced numbers of mature neurons in the hippocampus and ventral midbrain of Ngn2 null mutant animals does not appear to be due to cell death or migration defects [20], [31]. Instead it may be due to a defect in the generation and/or amplification of neuronal progenitors. Indeed, in the hippocampus of postnatal animals, we observed that cells lacking Ngn2 arrest in the cell cycle, maintain Pax6 expression and cease to proliferate.
When overexpressed in neural progenitors in vitro, Ngn2 lead to up-regulation of NeuroD1 and caused neuronal differentiation (Figure 6), which was not always the case when we overexpressed the same factor in vivo (Figure 7L, N and O). We also saw that Ngn2 does not always efficiently induce cell cycle exit. Typically some mitotically active eGFP+ cells were present in the DG of <span class="yellow">rats</span> injected with the Ngn2 retrovirus (Figure 7P), and we observed that cultured Ngn2-transduced cells are still capable of dividing. Thus, Ngn2 does not always promote cell cycle exit and neuronal commitment, but depending on the state of the cells, Ngn2 may instead promote alternate cellular fates [38]–[40]. Indeed, an earlier study has shown that Ngn2-overexpressing progenitors generate oligodendrocytes when grafted to the adult spinal cord [40]. We have also seen that Ngn2-overexpressing neural progenitors from the embryonic midbrain form astrocytes when grafted to the striatum (unpublished observations). Probably, Ngn2 cannot influence already committed cells, but rather would control neuroblasts production. One could speculate that Ngn2 oscillates during granule neuron formation, as recently demonstrated during neocorticogenesis [41], [42].<br><br>NeuroD1, but not Ngn2, is obligatory for granule neuron progenitor differentiation
Hippocampal granule progenitors can mature and express Tbr1 and Prox1, both during the development and postnatally, even in the absence of Ngn2. Because neuronal differentiation still occurs in Ngn2 null <span class="blue">mice</span>, it is clear that compensatory, Ngn2-independent mechanisms induce NeuroD1 expression. One candidate is Ngn1, which is expressed during neocorticogenesis, the specification of olfactory sensory neurons and during embryonic <span class="yellow">rat</span> hippocampal development [43]–[47]. Both Ngn1 and Ngn2 regulate NeuroD1 [19], [48]. The introduction of two mutant forms of Ngn1, a deletion of the basic region of Ngn1 and a substitution of two amino acids in the C-terminal basic region, prevents NeuroD1 expression and neuronal differentiation [48]. The double null Ngn1/Ngn2 mutant displays a more severe phenotype than single gene (Ngn1 or Ngn2) mutant <span class="blue">mice</span>. For example, the total brain size of the double mutants is much smaller [10], [32]. If the role of Ngn1 during hippocampal neurogenesis is to activate NeuroD1 and that of Ngn2 is to control granule neuroblasts production/amplification, the DG of double Ngn1/Ngn2 knockout <span class="blue">mice</span> should resemble that of NeuroD1 null mutant <span class="blue">mice</span>.
We demonstrated that NeuroD1 directs neuronal differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. In progenitors isolated from different embryonic brain regions and cultured in vitro, we found that overexpression of NeuroD1 induced neuronal differentiation. The neurons generated expressed PSA-NCAM, Dcx and MAP2. After in utero retroviral vector-mediated gene delivery, virtually all cells transduced with NeuroD1 became neurons. In contrast, progenitors transduced with Ngn2 or control retroviruses adopted a neuron-like morphology in only 70–85% of cases. Under in vitro cell culture conditions, when we overexpressed Ngn2 in progenitors derived from the LGE we observed robust expression of NeuroD1 and neuronal differentiation. These in vitro results differ from those we obtained when we transduced the embryonic brain with a viral vector expressing Ngn2. In this latter case, Ngn2 did not induce neurons and the transduced cells did not express NeuroD1. Therefore, Ngn2 appears to direct non-neuronal cell type specification in vivo [38]–[40]. Taken together, we have confirmed that NeuroD1 plays a key role in neuronal differentiation in the hippocampus, both during development and in the adult brain.<br><br>Concluding remark
We present a detailed classification of different stages in hippocampal neurogenesis. Our detailed molecular mapping of hippocampal neurogenesis allows for a more accurate analysis of how new factors stimulate neurogenesis at different steps in the development of granule neurons. Thereby we hope to facilitate the development of new agents, which stimulate endogenous progenitors in the treatment of diseases.<br><br>
Materials and Methods
Animal tissue preparation
The creation of the Ngn2 transgenic <span class="blue">mice</span> was reported elsewhere (ref guillemot). Heterozygote male and female <span class="blue">mice</span> were crossed to obtain WT, heterozygote (Ngn2+/GFP) and null mutant (Ngn2GFP/GFP) animals. Tails of the Ngn2 offspring were used to obtain DNA for determination of the genotype using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay as previously reported [31]. As null mutant Ngn2GFP/GFP do not survive longer than 2.5–3 weeks after birth, Ngn2GFP/GFP and their littermates were sacrificed at the postnatal ages of two days (P2) or two weeks for this study. Neurogenesis was assessed in two weeks or two months old WT <span class="blue">mice</span>. Sprague Dawley pregnant <span class="yellow">rats</span> were ordered from B&K Universal Ltd, Sollentuna, Sweden (hppt://www.bku.com). All animals were housed in groups with ad libitum access to food and water at a 12-h light/dark cycle. All experimental procedures conducted in this study had been approved by the Ethical Committee at Lund University.
For immunohistochemical analysis, <span class="blue">mice</span> (from two weeks old and adult stage) and juvenile <span class="yellow">rats</span> were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion with saline for 5–10 minutes, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 minutes. Brains were kept in PFA overnight at 4°C and subsequently cryopreserved in a 20–30% sucrose/0.1 M phosphate buffer solution until sectioning on a microtome apparatus (30 µm thickness sections, Microm Zeiss). Seven series of coronal sections were cut throughout the brain. Free-floating sections were preserved in antifreeze solution until immunohistochemistry was performed. Heads of postanatal two days old <span class="blue">mice</span> were decapitated and soaked in PFA 4% for 24 hours, at 4°C and transferred into sucrose solution until sectioning on cryostat apparatus (16 µm thickness; Leica CM3000). Sections were mounted on Superfrost glass slides and stored at −80°C until immunohistochemistry was performed.<br><br>Cloning, subcloning, virus production and titer measurement
The Moloney leukemia-derived retroviral vectors used in this study, pCMMP-IRES2eGFP-WPRE and pCMMP-Ngn2-IRES2eGFP-WPRE were previously described [40], [49]. To generate the construct pCMMP-NeuroD1-IRES2eGFP-WPRE, <span class="yellow">mouse</span> NeuroD1 cDNA was amplified from a pCS2+mtNeuroD1 plasmid (kindly provided by Professor Jackie Lee, Denver university, Boulder, USA) by PCR to introduce the restriction sites PmeI in 5′ and XhoI in 3′. Amplification of cDNA was performed as previously described [49]. The construction was verified by enzymatic restriction and by DNA sequencing using BigDye 3.1 (ABI). All infectious particles were produced using the producer cell line 293VSV-G and as previously described [49]. The titer of each retrovirus was measured by flow-cytometry based on eGFP expression, four days following infection of HT1080 cells and ranged from 0.5×109−2.1×109 TU/ml (All details on how to produce infectious particles can be provided upon request).<br><br>Neurosphere generation, transduction and differentiation
Pregnant female <span class="yellow">Sprague-Dawley rats</span> (B & K Universal, Sollentuna, Sweden) were terminally anesthetized by an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (i.p., 60 ng/ml). Embryos at stage embryonic day E14.5 (Plug day as day 0) were collected and cortical-hippocampal neurospheres were generated following dissection of the dorso-posterior part of the cortical tissue, and generated as previously described [49]. In this study, second passage (P2) neurospheres were used to study the effect of the overexpression of Ngn2 and NeuroD1 on neuronal differentiation. Each well, containing an equal starting population of 200,000 cells/ml, corresponding to 15–25 neurospheres, was transduced independently with each retrovirus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, in proliferation medium supplemented by protamine-sulfate (4 mg/ml, Sigma). To induce differentiation, the medium was replaced with normal basic differentiation medium two days post-transduction and subsequently changed every other day until fixation.<br><br>Immunocytochemistry, immunohistochemistry and microscopy
The antibodies used in this study are: <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-GFAP (1∶1000; DAKO), <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-Nestin (1∶100; BD PharMingen), <span class="yellow">guinea pig</span> anti-Glast (1∶500; Chemicon), <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-Prox1 (1∶1000; Covance), <span class="yellow">goat</span> anti-Ngn2 (1∶20; Santa Cruz), <span class="yellow">goat</span> anti-NeuroD1 (1∶200; Santa Cruz), <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-Pax6 (1∶150; Covance), <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-Trb2 (1∶500; Chemicon), <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-Trb1: (1∶1000; Chemicon), <span class="yellow">goat</span> anti-Dcx: (1∶500; Santa Cruz), <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-PSA-NCAM: (1∶500; Chemicon), <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-NeuN (1∶300; Chemicon), <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-Calretinin (1∶500; Swant); <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-Sox2 (1∶100; R&D systems), <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-Mash1 (1∶100; BD PharMingen), <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-NeuroD2 (1∶300; ABCAM), <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-MAP2 (1∶500; Sigma), <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-Ki67 (1∶150; NovaCastra) and <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-phospho-Histone H3. The secondary antibodies (1∶200) Cy2, FITC, Cy3 and Cy5 were from Jackson IR laboratories, Alexa-fluor 488, 568, 595 and 647 from Invitrogen-Molecular Probes. DAPI (1∶1000) was purchased from Sigma.
For immunocytochemistry, cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at day five, rinsed with PBS three times prior to pre-incubation with a blocking solution (10% <span class="yellow">donkey</span> serum, 0.25% TritonX100 in PBS) for 1 hour. The remainder of the procedure was performed as previously described [49]. Specimen analyses were performed using a Leica confocal microscope (Leica software, equipped with a GreNe and a HeNe laser, using the following lines of excitation: 488 nm, 594 nm and 647 nm). Samples were analyzed using 20×, 40× and 63× objectives, sometimes zoomed. Figures were composed in CANVAS-X software.<br><br>Bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and Cloro-deoxyuridine (CldU) pulse labeling and immunohisto- and immunocyto-chemistry
To assess cell proliferation and ongoing neurogenesis in vivo, animals were injected with BrdU (100 mg/kg, Sigma), two hours prior to sacrifice (for both P2 and two weeks old Ngn2 <span class="blue">mice</span>). To assess neurogenesis, BrdU (100 mg/kg) was injected 48 hours prior to sacrifice (for P2 animals, BrdU was injected in pregnant dams half day prior to give birth). Immunohistochemistry was carried on as described above using a <span class="yellow">rat</span> anti-CldU/BrdU primary antibody (1∶200, monoclonal, Immunologicalsdirect, Oxfordshire, UK), with an additional denaturation in 1 M HCl for 30 minutes prior to pre-incubation with serum.
To assess the neuronal-inducing activity of Ngn2 and NeuroD1, transduced cultures were incubated with CldU (20 µM, Sigma) for 2 days, after a period of differentiation of five days. For immunocytochemistry, cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at day 7, rinsed with PBS three times, treated with 1 M HCl at 65°C for 5–10 min, pre-incubated and then incubated with a <span class="yellow">rat</span> anti-CldU/BrdU antibody and other primary antibodies. The remainder of the procedure was performed according to the protocol for immunohistochemistry already mentioned.<br><br>In utero surgery
Timed pregnant female <span class="yellow">Sprague Dawley rats</span> with embryos at gestational age E15.5 were anesthetized with halothane. The mother was placed in the lower level of a two-level wooden stage. The abdomen was shaved with an electric razor and then cleaned with 70% alcohol. A 2–3 cm midline laparotomy was performed. Each uterine horn was carefully taken out individually and the number of embryos recorded. One horn was then placed back inside the mother, whilst the other horn was prepared for injection. The embryos were kept moist with constant application of warm saline to prevent dehydration. Approximately 2 µl of viral suspension (1×10∧9TU/ml) was injected into the lateral ventricle of each embryo, except for the embryo closest to the vagina. After the injections, the uterine horns were placed back into the abdomen. The abdominal wall and the overlying skin were then sutured. Care was taken not to damage abdominal muscles so that normal delivery of the pups was possible at term. The entire surgery generally took about 45 minutes to one hour. Each mother was allowed to recover in her cage before being returned to the animal stable. Shredded paper was added to each cage to encourage nesting and special care was taken not to stress the mothers. Following normal delivery, the pups were allowed to develop to adulthood up to two weeks.<br><br>Quantification
For the in vivo experiment, manual cell counting was performed on 18 and 30 µm thick brain sections for two days and two weeks old animals, respectively. The brain of P2 animals was cut into 10 series of coronal sections; the brain of two-weeks old animals was cut into 7–8 series of coronal sections. For each staining, one-two series from three to five different individuals were analyzed per genotype using a confocal microscope with 1, 2 or 3 lines of excitation, in sequential scanning in order to avoid false positives. When two series were analyzed, only one series was counted. The mean number of cells per hippocampus expressing the markers of interest, was calculated for each brain, based on the analysis of 6–8 consecutive dorsal hippocampal sections. The final mean number of cells per section was calculated by adding the mean number from each individual. We expressed the data as the mean number of positive cells±standard error of the mean (SEM). In this study, more than 25 Ngn2 null, >45 Ngn2 heterozygotes, and >60 WT individuals (including <span class="yellow">rats</span> injected with retroviruses) were analyzed, in total. Statistical comparison was performed using one-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) with transcription factor, cellular marker, genotype or time as variables, followed by post-hoc analysis when significant differences were observed, using Statview 5.0 software (SAS institute Inc.). For cell culture experiments, three independent experiments were performed, each in duplicate. The counting was based on seven randomly chosen different fields of view. For each diagram, the level of significance (p-value) is represented as follows: P<0.05 = *; P<0.001 = **; P<0.0001 = ***. All data are expressed as±standard error of the mean (SEM).<br><br><span class="yellow">Human</span> sample and RT-PCR
The brain from a 64 year-old male was provided by the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center. The individual whose brain tissue was being analyzed gave written consent for storage and use of his tissue for research. Five millimeters thick fresh <span class="yellow">human</span> hippocampal tissue sample was snap frozen. The frozen tissue block was cut into 20 series of coronal sections, using a cryostat. Every 10 sections, one section was placed in an Eppendorf tube, on dry ice. Pooled sections were used for RT-PCR. Total RNA was prepared using Trizol and RNAeasy, supplemented with RNAGuard as previously described [49]. The RNA was digested with <span class="yellow">shrimp</span> DNAse before cDNA synthesis, which was performed using a mix of oligo-dT and random hexamer primers and SuperscriptII reverse transcriptase. Advantage2 polymerase mix (Clontech/BRL) was used for PCR, with the following cycling conditions: 10 cycles of 94° C for 30 seconds, 68°C for 2 minutes, 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 60°C for 1 minute, 68°C for 1 minute and 30 seconds, one cycle of 68° C for 2 minutes, soak at 16°C.

<h3>pmcA411032</h3>Down-regulation of the M6P/IGF-II receptor increases cell proliferation and reduces apoptosis in neonatal <span class="yellow">rat</span> cardiac myocytes
Abstract
Background
The mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor-II receptor (M6P/IGF2R) is a multi-functional protein that has been implicated in regulation of cell growth and apoptosis. Cardiac myocytes express relatively high levels of M6P/IGF2R, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis has been identified in a variety of cardiovascular disorders, such as myocardial infarction and heart failure. However, involvement of M6P/IGF2R in the pathogenesis of these conditions has not been determined. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the role of M6P/IGF2R in regulation of cardiac myocyte growth and apoptosis.<br><br>Results
We down-regulated the expression of M6P/IGF2R in neonatal <span class="yellow">rat</span> cardiac myocytes and examined the effect on cell proliferation and apoptosis. Infection of neonatal cardiomyocytes with an <span class="yellow">adenovirus</span> expressing a ribozyme targeted against the M6P/IGF2R significantly reduced the level of M6P/IGF2R mRNA, as determined by RT-PCR and Ribonuclease Protection Assay (RPA). M6P-containing protein binding and endocytosis as well as the M6P/IGF2R-mediated internalization of 125I-IGF-II were lower in the ribozyme-treated cells than the control myocytes, indicating that the number of functional M6P/IGF2R in the ribozyme treated cells was reduced. Accordingly, a marked increase in cell proliferation and a reduced cell susceptibility to hypoxia- and TNF-induced apoptosis were observed in the ribozyme-treated cells.<br><br>Conclusions
These findings suggest that M6P/IGF2R may play a role in regulation of cardiac myocyte growth and apoptosis. Down regulation of this gene in cardiac tissues might be a new approach to prevention of cell death or promotion of mitogenesis for certain heart diseases.<br><br><br><br>Background
The mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor-II receptor (M6P/IGF2R) is a unique protein that interacts with multiple ligands, some of which are important growth regulatory factors [1]. The M6P/IGF2R participates in internalization and lysosomal degradation of IGF-II, a mitogen normally acting through the IGF-I receptor to stimulate cell proliferation [2]. The M6P/IGF2 receptor is required for the activation of TGF-β [3], a potent growth inhibitor for many cell types. This receptor is also involved in the binding, transport and activation of newly-synthesized lysosomal enzymes, such as cathepsins [4,5], which have been recently implicated in the induction of apoptosis [6]. On the basis of these functions, the M6P/IGF2R has been proposed to play a significant role in regulation of cell growth and apoptosis [7].
Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a tightly regulated process used to remove excess, hazardous or damaged somatic cells, and is crucial for the development, maintenance and survival of an organism. However, alterations in the control of apoptosis have also been shown to contribute to <span class="yellow">human</span> diseases. In fact, morphological and biochemical markers of apoptosis have been identified in a wide variety of cardiovascular disorders, including myocardial infarction and heart failure. This suggests that activation of apoptotic pathways contributes to cardiomyocyte loss and subsequent cardiac dysfunction in these conditions. A number of factors involved in cardiomyocyte apoptosis are currently known and include insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) and the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family [8]. There are indications that other factors may be involved in induction and regulation of cardiac apoptosis. However, these potential factors and their corresponding mechanisms have not been identified.
Several lines of evidence point to the potential involvement of M6P/IGF2R in cardiac myocyte proliferation and apoptosis. Cardiac myocytes express relatively high levels of M6P/IGF2R and transgenic <span class="blue">mice</span> containing a homologous deletion of the M6P/IGF2R gene manifest ventricular hyperplasia due to an increase in cell number [9,10], suggesting that the M6P/IGF2R normally acts to suppress cardiac myocyte cell growth. It has also been shown that TGF-β, a potent growth suppressor whose activation requires the binding of latent TGF-β to M6P/IGF2R [3], is commonly upregulated in chronic heart failure [11]. Additional evidence for the involvement of M6P/IGF2R in regulation of apoptosis comes from studies of tumorigenesis. It has been shown that M6P/IGF2R expression is significantly reduced in a variety of tumors and loss of heterozygocity (LOH) at the M6P/IGF2R gene locus 6q26 have been found in breast, liver cancers and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung [12-15]. Although several studies have examined the effect of M6P/IGF2R over-expression on cell growth [7], it is not known whether down-regulation of this receptor protein leads to cellular protection against apoptosis.
Ribozymes are catalytic RNA molecules that cleave a complementary mRNA sequence [16], thereby inactivating specific mRNAs and suppressing gene expression in vitro and in vivo [17,18]. Ribozymes have been shown to be highly specific, efficient and stable. They can be packaged into viral vectors to enhance transfer into cells and to achieve longer expression compared with naked oligonucleotides. In the present study, we employed ribozyme technology to study the role of M6P/IGF2R in regulation of cardiac myocyte cell growth. A hammerhead ribozyme against the M6P/IGF2R mRNA was constructed and packaged in an adenoviral vector. We then examined the effect of ribozyme-mediated down-regulation of M6P/IGF2R expression on cell growth and hypoxia- and TNF-induced apoptosis.<br><br>Results
Cleavage reaction of the ribozyme in vitro
The M6P/IGF2R ribozyme we constructed has 13-bp binding arms complementary to the target site of M6P/IGF2R mRNA, and a catalytic core (Fig. 1A). To evaluate the bioactivity of the ribozyme and the accessibility of the target site, a cleavage reaction was performed in vitro. The substrates, [α-32P] labeled RNA transcripts containing 45 bp of M6P/IGF2R mRNA or an unmatched sequence, were incubated with the ribozyme as described (see Materials and Methods). The ribozyme cleaved only the specific M6P/IGF2R mRNA into the expected products. In the assay of time course, the hammerhead ribozyme was able to cleave 24.2% of the M6P/IGF2R target within 10 minutes of incubation, 50.3% of the M6P/IGF2R target within 40 minutes of incubation, and by 640 minutes, 80.8% of the M6P/IGF2R target was converted to the expected products (Fig. 1B). This ribozyme did not digest the unmatched sequence (Fig. 1B). These results indicate a high efficiency and specificity of the ribozyme in vitro.<br><br>Ribozymes down-regulate M6P/IGF2R expression in cardiac myocytes
To examine the ability of the ribozyme to reduce levels of M6P/IGF2R mRNA in cultured cardiac myocytes, total RNA was extracted from cells infected with Ad-GFP/IGF2R-Rz or Ad-GFP, and subjected to RT-PCR using M6P/IGF2R-specific primers. Primers specific for β-actin were added to a parallel reaction to serve as an internal standard. Cells were used 4 days after infection, with average infection efficiency of 70–80% (for which a viral dose used had minimal cytotoxicity). The RT-PCR product of M6P/IGF2R was 856 bp, and the β-actin product was 285 bp. As shown in Fig. 2A, the Ad-GFP/IGF2R-Rz-infected cells exhibited a significantly lower level of M6P/IGF2R mRNA than Ad-GFP-infected cells, with a reduction of about 50%. This result was confirmed by ribonuclease protection assay (RPA), in which GAPDH was used as a control (Fig. 2C &2D). There was no significant difference in the level of M6P/IGF2R mRNA between Ad-GFP-infected cells and uninfected cells (data not shown), indicating that infection with the <span class="yellow">adenovirus</span> itself did not alter the endogenous M6P/IGF2R mRNA level. The results demonstrated that the ribozyme was highly effective in suppressing M6P/IGF2R expression in cultured cardiac myocytes.<br><br>Effect of ribozyme expression on the functional activity of M6P/IGF2R
To determine the effect of the ribozyme on the functional activity of M6P/IGF2R, binding and internalization of exogenous 125I-IGF-II was measured in cells infected with Ad-GFP/IGF2R-Rz. As shown in Fig. 3A, cells infected with Ad-GFP/IGF2R-Rz showed a 54% reduction in 125I-IGF-II internalization when compared with the control cells (infected with Ad-GFP). We also examined the effect of the ribozyme on the M6P-binding activity of the M6P/IGF2R using the M6P-bearing lysosomal enzyme, β-glucuronidase, as a probe. The results showed that the maximal M6P-binding capacity of cells treated with the ribozyme was about 50% less than that of controls (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, we assessed the ability of cells to internalize exogenous β-glucuronidase after treatment with ribozyme. Similarly, the M6P-inhibitable endocytosis of β-glucuronidase by ribozyme-treated cells was about 52% less than that of control cells (Fig. 3C). These results confirm that the number of functional M6P/IGF2R in ribozyme-treated cells was reduced.<br><br>Adenoviral delivery of ribozymes increases the proliferation of cardiac myocytes
We examined the effects of the ribozyme on the growth of cultured neonatal <span class="yellow">rat</span> cardiac myocytes. Morphological evaluation showed a remarkable difference in growth pattern between Ad-GFP/IGF2R-Rz-infected cells and the control cells: the ribozyme-expressing cells formed larger and more spread colonies (Fig. 4). Assessment of cell proliferative activity by the MTT assay and counts of viable cells showed that the number of cardiac myocytes in ribozyme-expressing cultures was significantly higher than in control cultures (Fig. 5). These results indicate that treatment with M6P/IGF2R-ribozyme can promote cardiac myocyte proliferation.<br><br>Effect of M6P/IGF2R-ribozyme expression on apoptosis of cardiac myocytes
We examined the effects of ribozyme expression on TNF-α and hypoxia-induced apoptosis of cultured cardiac myocytes. After a 24 hr challenge with hypoxia, the number of apoptotic cells in M6P/IGF2R-Rz expressing cultures was 38% lower than in control cultures as determined by Hoechst staining (which highlights the nuclei of apoptotic cells) and ELISA (Fig. 6A, 7A). MTT analysis showed that the number of viable cells in ribozyme-treated cultures was 40% higher than in control cultures (Fig. 7A).
After treatment with TNF-α, as shown in Fig. 6B, a large number of control cells underwent apoptosis, as indicated by morphological changes (small round shape) and bright blue nuclear staining. There were significantly more apoptotic cells in control cultures than in cultures expressing the Ad-GFP/IGF2R-Rz. The number of apoptotic cells, as measured by the cell death ELISA assay, in cultures infected with Ad-GFP/IGF2R-Rz was significantly (about 40%) lower than in cultures infected with Ad-GFP (Fig. 7B). Accordingly, the number of viable cells, as measured by MTT analysis, in cultures infected with Ad-GFP/IGF2R-Rz was significantly (about 45%) higher than in cultures infected with Ad-GFP (Fig. 7B). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that decreasing M6P/IGF2R expression by ribozyme treatment can reduce cell apoptosis.<br><br>
Discussion
Some 62,000,000 Americans have one or more types of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CVD is the leading cause (40.1%) of death in the United States. Myocardial infarction and heart failure, conditions accompanied by cardiac myocyte apoptosis, represent 23% of all CVDs and are a growing clinical challenge in need of novel therapeutic strategies. In this study, we investigated the M6P/IGF2R as a potential new therapeutic target for reduction of cardiac apoptosis and cardiac injury in these conditions.
Using ribozyme technology we down-regulated the expression of the M6P/IGF2R in neonatal cardiac myocytes. We then examined cell proliferation and apoptosis under normal conditions and post challenge with either hypoxia, a model of ischemia-reperfusion, or TNF-α, a cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic heart failure [19]. Our results demonstrate an association of a decrease in the expression and function of the M6P/IGF2R with increased cell proliferation and decreased cell susceptibility to hypoxia- and TNF-induced apoptosis. Expression of the ribozyme targeted against the M6P/IGF2R in cardiomyocytes resulted in down-regulation of M6P/IGF2R expression, as measured by RT-PCR and RPA, and of M6P/IGF2R function, as indicated by a decrease in internalization of 125I-IGF-II, and β-glucuronidase binding and endocytosis.
MTT analysis and viable cell counts showed that ribozyme-mediated down-regulation of M6P/IGF2R resulted in a marked increase in cell proliferation of cardiomyocytes, which normally express high levels of M6P/IGF2R [20] and have limited proliferative capabilities [21]. These results are consistent with the findings of previous knockout studies [9,10]. Since the M6P/IGF2R has multiple actions on cell growth, its proliferative effect on the heart cells observed in this study might involve multiple mechanisms. However, it is likely that unchecked IGF-II stimulation plays a key role in the effect. Because the M6P/IGF2R is believed to sequester and degrade IGF-II [2], a decrease in M6P/IGF2R expression and function could result in decreased degradation and hence increased bioavailability of IGF-II to the IGF-I receptor, which mediates the growth-promoting effect of IGF-II. Supporting evidence for the involvement of IGF-II in the proliferative effect resulting from loss of M6P/IGF2R function comes from studies of M6P/IGF2R knock-out <span class="blue">mice</span>. M6P/IGF2R-null <span class="blue">mice</span> display global hyperplasia that coincides with elevated levels of IGF-II. Most importantly, however, the lethal nature of an M6P/IGF2R-null phenotype is reversed in an IGF-II-null background [9]. Our results showing that ribozyme-mediated down-regulation of M6P/IGF2R lead to a decrease in IGF-II internalization support the above possibility. However, further investigation to confirm this mechanism is warranted.
More importantly, our results also showed that M6P/IGF2R down-regulation resulted in decreased sensitivity of cardiomyocytes to hypoxia- and TNF-induced apoptosis. There is evidence that lysosomal enzymes, such as cathepsins B and D contribute to hypoxia- and TNF-induced apoptosis in vitro [22-25] and in vivo [26,27]. The M6P/IGF2R has been shown to be involved in binding, transport and activation of lysosomal enzymes, including cathepsins [4,5]. Therefore, it is possible that down-regulation of the M6P/IGF2R results in improper trafficking and activation of cathepsins. This, in turn would eliminate the apoptotic cascades triggered by these enzymes under hypoxia and TNF stimulation and result in decreased sensitivity of cardiomyocytes to apoptosis.
It has also been shown that TNF stimulation involves the activation of TGF-β [28-30], a ligand of M6P/IGF2R that has been implicated in the progression of chronic heart failure [11,31]. Therefore, down-regulation of M6P/IGF2R expression could also lead to a decreased bioavailability of activated TGF-β, thereby decreasing the sensitivity of cardiomyocytes to the TNF/TGF-β apoptotic pathway. The detailed mechanism of the observed effects is unknown and requires further investigation.<br><br>Conclusions
The present study demonstrates that ribozyme-mediated down-regulation of expression and functional activity of the M6P/IGF2R results in a decrease in the susceptibility of cardiac myocytes to apoptotic stimuli. These findings suggest that this receptor might be involved in cardiac cell growth and apoptosis. The ability of the M6P/IGF2R ribozyme to reduce M6P/IGF2R expression and function in transfected cells verifies the utility of the ribozyme in studying the role of M6P/IGF2R in cardiomyocyte growth and apoptosis. In addition to its utility as a research tool, the ribozyme, with further exploration and development, might have potential application as a therapeutic agent to prevent cell death or promote mitogenesis for certain clinical conditions, such as, myocardial infarction and chronic heart failure.<br><br>Methods
Construction of recombinant M6P/IGF2R-RZ adenoviral vector
The nucleotide numbers of the <span class="yellow">rat</span> M6P/IGF2R sequence targeted by the hammerhead ribozyme is 1147–1160 after coding site (exon 9). The structure of the M6P/IGF2R hammerhead ribozyme is shown in Fig. 1. A 49 bp M6P/IGF2R ribozyme oligonucleotide, 5'-GAATTCCCC ACACTG ATGAGCCGCTTCGGCGGCGAAACATTCAAC GCGT-3' and the corresponding reverse complementary strand were synthesized. The fragments were subcloned to produce a plasmid containing a ribozyme against M6P/IGF2R. For construction of the recombinant <span class="yellow">adenovirus</span> containing the M6P/IGF2R-ribozyme (pAd-GFP/IGF2R-Rz), the segments containing the ribozymes were amplified by PCR and cloned into a pAdTrack-CMV vector and then recombined homologously with an adenoviral backbone pAdEasy 1 vector to generate (pAd-GFP/IGF2R-Rz), following the protocol described by He et al. [32]. The pAd-GFP/IGF2R-Rz carries both the IGF2R-Rz and GFP (as reporter) genes, each under the control of separate cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoters. Another viral vector, pAd-GFP, which carries the GFP gene only under the control of the CMV promoter, was generated and used as a control vector. The adenoviral vector DNA were linerized with Pac I and transfected into the replication-permissive 293 cells (E1A transcomplementing cell line) by using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies) to produce E1-deleted, replication-defective recombinant <span class="yellow">adenovirus</span> as described previously [33]. Large-scale amplification of recombinant <span class="yellow">adenovirus</span> in 293 cells was followed by purification using a discontinuous CsCl gradient. The constructs were confirmed by enzymatic digestion and DNA sequencing.<br><br>Transcription and cleavage reaction of ribozyme in vitro
Plasmids containing the ribozyme or the substrate (either 45 bp of M6P/IGF2R mRNA or an unmatched sequence 5'-GTGCTGTCTGTATG-3') were linearized with MluI, respectively. All transcripts were generated with T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). Substrate transcripts were labeled by incorporation of [α-32P] UTP (NEN Life Science Products, Inc.). Specific activity of the [α-32P] UTP (10 μCi/μl) and the base composition of each substrate molecule were used to calculate the substrate concentration. Ribozyme transcripts were quantified spectrophotometrically. (The half-life of the M6P/IGF2R target is about 280 minutes).
Cleavage reaction mixture contained substrate RNA (40 nM), increasing amounts of ribozyme (60 nM), 20 mM MgCl2 and 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0, in a final volume of 10 μl. The mixture was incubated at 37°C for a time-course of cleavage reaction from 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, to 640 minutes and the cleavage reaction was stopped by addition of loading buffer (80% formamide, 10 mM Na2EDTA, pH 8.0, and 1 mg/ml each bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol). Cleavage products were analyzed on a 15% polyacrylamide and 8M urea gel. Product and substrate fragments were quantitated by using NIH Imager.<br><br>Cell cultures and infection with Ad-GFP/Rz-IGF2R and Ad-GFP
Cardiac myocytes were isolated from 1-day-old newborn <span class="yellow">rats</span> using the Neonatal Cardiomyocyte Isolation System (Worthington). The isolated cells were plated in 6-well plates and cultured in F-10 medium containing 5% (vol/vol) FBS and 10% (vol/vol) <span class="yellow">horse</span> serum at 37°C in a tissue culture incubator with 5% CO2 and 98% relative humidity. Cells were used for experiments after 2–3 days of culture. Viral infections were carried out by adding viral particles at various concentrations (usually, 2 × 108 virus particles/ml) to culture medium containing 2% (vol/vol) FBS. Initially, optimal viral concentration was determined by using Ad-GFP to achieve an optimal balance of high gene expression and low viral titer to minimize cytotoxicity. After 24 hours of incubation, the infection medium was replaced with normal (15% vol/vol serum) culture medium. For treatment with IGF-II, cells were incubated with 50 ng/ml IGF-II after 24 hours infection with Ad-GFP/IGF2R-Rz or Ad-GFP. Four days after infection, cells were used for analysis of gene expression of M6P/IGF2R and its effect on cell growth and apoptosis.<br><br>Analysis of gene expression in cardiac myocytes
The M6P/IGF2R transcripts were determined by both RT-PCR and Ribonuclease Protection Assay (RPA). RT-PCR was performed using the GeneAmp EZ rTth RNA PCR kit (Roche). Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using an RNA isolation kit (Qiagen,), according to the manufacturer's protocol. M6P/IGF2R transcripts were amplified using the primers (5'-GACAGGCTCGTTCTGACTTA-3') and (5'-CTTCCACTCTTATCCACAGC-3') specific to the M6P/IGF2R. Each RT-PCR assay was performed in triplicate and product levels varied by less than 3.2% for each RNA sample. Primers specific for β-actin cDNA were added to a parallel reaction to standardize for variations in PCR between samples. PCR products were resolved on a 1.0% agarose gel, visualized under UV light and quantitated using NIH Imager.
RPA was performed using the RPA III kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Briefly, total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using a total RNA isolation reagent (TRIzol, Gibco BRL) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The plasmid containing the <span class="yellow">rat</span> M6P/IGF2R gene was linearized and used as a transcription template. Antisense RNA probes were transcribed in vitro using [33P]-UTP, T7 polymerase (Riboprobea System T7 kit, Promega), hybridized with the total RNA extracted from the <span class="yellow">rat</span> cardiomyocytes, and digested with ribonuclease to remove non-hybridized RNA and probe. The protected RNA·RNA was resolved on a denaturing 5% sequence gel and subjected to autoradiography. A probe targeting the GAPDH gene was used as an internal control.<br><br>Measurement of 125I-IGF-II internalization
Cells were incubated at 37°C for 2 hrs in serum-free F-10 culture medium containing 125I-labeled IGF-II (0.5 ng/ml) with or without excess unlabeled IGF-II (2 μg/ml). Following the incubation, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and cell-associated radioactivity was determined by a γ counter. Specific internalized 125I-IGF-II was calculated by subtracting the count of samples with excessive unlabeled IGF-II from that without unlabeled IGF-II, and normalized to protein contents.<br><br>Beta-glucuronidase binding assay
Binding of β-glucuronidase was assayed as described previously [34,35]. Briefly, cells were permeabilized with 0.25% saponin in 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.5% <span class="yellow">human</span> serum albumin, and 10 mM mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) for 30 minutes on ice. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 0.05% saponin. They were incubated with 20,000 units/ml β-glucuronidase from <span class="yellow">bovine</span> liver (Sigma) in 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.5) containing 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.5% <span class="yellow">human</span> serum albumin, 0.5% saponin with or without 10 mM M6P overnight on ice. Cells were washed five times with ice-cold PBS containing 0.05% saponin and sonicated in 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.6). The protein concentration of solubilized cell extract was measured and enzyme activity was assayed as follows: for each reaction 50 ul cell extract were added to 500 ul of 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.0) containing 1 mM paranitrophenyl (PNP)-β-glucuronide (Sigma) as substrate. After an incubation period of 3 hours at 37°C, 500 ul 1 M Na2CO3 were added to each reaction and the absorbance was measured at 400 nm. Experimental values were compared to a standard curve that was constructed using 1–100 nM solutions of PNP (Sigma) in 500 ul 100 mM sodium acetate and 500 u1 1 M Na2CO3. Specific activity was calculated as nM of PNP produced/hour/mg of protein.<br><br>Beta-glucuronidase endocytosis assay
Beta-glucuronidase endocytosis assay was carried out as described previously [36]. Briefly, confluent cell cultures were washed twice with pre-warmed serum-free DMEM followed by incubation with DMEM containing 5 mg/ml <span class="yellow">human</span> serum albumin and 10 mM M6P for 20 minutes. Following incubation cells were washed 3 times with pre-warmed DMEM. Cells were then incubated in DMEM containing 5 mg/ml <span class="yellow">human</span> serum albumin alone or 4000 units β-glucuronidase with or without 10 mM M6P for 2 hours at 37°C. Following the incubation, the cells were washed 5 times with ice-cold PBS and subjected to enzyme activity assay as described above.<br><br>Cell proliferation assay (MTT assay and cell counts)
Cardiac myocytes were grown in culture plates (tissue culture grade, 12 wells, flat bottom) in a final volume of 1 ml serum-containing culture medium per well, in a humidified atmosphere (37°C and 5% C02) for 3 days. After infection with Ad-GFP/IGF2R-Rz or Ad-GFP, cells were incubated with or without 50 ng/ml IGF-II for 4 days. Following supplementation with IGF-II, 100 μl MTT labeling reagent (Roche) were added to each well and cells were incubated for 4 hours, followed by addition of 1 ml solubilization solution into each well. The plate was placed in an incubator at 37°C overnight. Spectrophotometrical absorbency of the samples was measured using an UV-visible Recording Spectrophotometer with wavelength of 550–690 nm. In addition, the total number of viable cells in each treatment was counted by trypan blue exclusion method using a hemocytometer.<br><br>Induction and analysis of cell apoptosis
Cells were infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-GFP/IGF2R-Rz. Seventy-two hours post infection, cells were treated with TNF (0.1 ng/ml) for 24 hrs or subjected to hypoxia. For induction of apoptosis by hypoxia, cell culture medium was changed to serum-free F-10 saturated with 95% N2/5% CO2 and cells were placed in a 37°C airtight box saturated with 95% N2/5% CO2 for 24 hrs. For normoxic controls, culture medium was changed to F-10/5%F BS/10% HS and cells were placed in a 37°C/5% CO2 incubator for 24 hrs before analysis.
Apoptotic cells were identified by Hoechst staining using the Vybrant™ Apoptosis Kit #5 (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In addition, after infection with Ad-GFP or Ad-GFP/IGF2R-Rz and challenge with either TNF or hypoxia, cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and cell apoptosis was determined using the Cell Death Detection ELISA Kit assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol.<br><br>Statistical analysis
Students' t-test was used to evaluate the difference between two values. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Statistical significance was accepted at the level of p < 0.05.<br><br>

<h3>pmcA1075922</h3>Tissue-dependent isoforms of mammalian Fox-1 homologs are associated with tissue-specific splicing activities
Abstract
An intronic hexanucleotide UGCAUG has been shown to play a critical role in the regulation of tissue-specific alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs in a wide range of tissues. Vertebrate Fox-1 has been shown to bind to this element, in a highly sequence-specific manner, through its RNA recognition motif (RRM). In mammals, there are at least two Fox-1-related genes, ataxin-2 binding protein 1 (A2BP1)/Fox-1 and Fxh/Rbm9, which encode an identical RRM. Here, we demonstrate that both <span class="yellow">mouse</span> Fxh and A2BP1 transcripts undergo tissue-specific alternative splicing, generating protein isoforms specific to brain and muscle. These tissue-specific isoforms are characterized for their abilities to regulate neural cell-specific alternative splicing of a cassette exon, N30, in the non-muscle myosin heavy chain II-B pre-mRNA, previously shown to be regulated through an intronic distal downstream enhancer (IDDE). All Fxh and A2BP1 isoforms with the RRM are capable of binding to the IDDE in vitro through the UGCAUG elements. Each isoform, however, shows quantitative differences in splicing activity and nuclear distribution in transfected cells. All Fxh isoforms and a brain isoform of A2BP1 show a predominant nuclear localization. Brain isoforms of both Fxh and A2BP1 promote N30 splicing much more efficiently than do the muscle-specific isoforms. Skeletal muscles express additional isoforms that lack a part of the RRM. These isoforms are incapable of activating neural cell-specific splicing and, moreover, can inhibit UGCAUG-dependent N30 splicing. These findings suggest that tissue-specific isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 play an important role in determining tissue specificity of UGCAUG-mediated alternative splicing.<br><br>INTRODUCTION
Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA is one of the fundamental mechanisms for the regulation of gene expression in higher eukaryotes (1,2). Developmentally regulated, cell type- or tissue-specific, and signal-induced alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs takes place in multicellular organisms throughout their lifetimes. Misregulation or abnormalities in pre-mRNA splicing, in some instances, leads to cellular dysfunctions found in <span class="yellow">human</span> and animal diseases (3–5). Using various model systems of regulated alternative splicing, a number of pre-mRNA features that influence alternative splice site selection have been defined (1,2). These include enhancer and repressor RNA sequences located in exons and introns. Identification of RNA-binding proteins targeting these cis-regulatory elements is currently in progress. In vertebrates, participation of the SR family proteins and hnRNP proteins, such as PTB and hnRNPA1, in alternative splicing regulation via binding to the cis-regulatory elements have been shown in many tissue-specific splicing models (6,7). Although these RNA-binding proteins are ubiquitously expressed, their different abundance in different cells, differences in their post-translational modifications in different cellular contexts and their different abilities to assemble multiprotein complexes in different pre-mRNA contexts are thought to contribute to the determination of cell type-specific patterns of alternative splicing. For the last few years, tissue-specific and tissue-enriched RNA-binding proteins have begun to be identified as splicing regulators. These include brain-specific (or enriched) Nova-1, nPTB (brPTB) and some of the CELF family proteins (8–12). Discovery of these proteins has had a great impact on studies aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms of alternative splicing regulation.
One of the intronic cis-elements, which are involved in tissue-specific or differentiation stage-dependent regulation of alternative splicing, is the hexanucleotide UGCAUG. The importance of this element was originally recognized in fibronectin pre-mRNA by Huh and Hynes (13). Since then, alternative splicing specific to a variety of tissues or cell types, including neural cells, muscles, epithelial cells and erythrocytes, has been shown to be modulated via this element (14–21). Recently, Jin et al. (21) discovered that a <span class="yellow">zebrafish</span> homolog of <span class="yellow">Caenorhabditis elegans</span> Fox-1 (22) could bind specifically to the pentanucleotide GCAUG by in vitro selection from randomized RNA sequences. This pentanucleotide is almost identical to the hexanucleotide UGCAUG except for the first U. Moreover, the <span class="yellow">zebrafish</span> Fox-1 homolog, as well as the <span class="yellow">mouse</span> Fox-1 homolog, are capable of repressing the inclusion of an alternative cassette exon of the ATP synthase F1γ pre-mRNA via binding to GCAUG, which mimics muscle-specific exclusion of this exon. This <span class="yellow">mouse</span> homolog is identical to the ataxin-2 binding protein 1 (A2BP1), which has been previously cloned in <span class="yellow">humans</span> and <span class="blue">mice</span> as the cDNA encoding a protein, which interacts with ataxin-2, the product of the causative gene for spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (23,24). In addition to A2BP1/Fox-1, another <span class="yellow">mouse</span> homolog of <span class="yellow">C.elegans</span> Fox-1, Fxh, has been independently cloned as a cDNA, which is induced by androgen in motor neurons (25). Of note is that A2BP1/Fox-1 and Fxh share an identical RNA recognition motif (RRM) at the amino acid level. Therefore, two genes in the <span class="yellow">mouse</span> genome encode homologs of nematode Fox-1. According to the names given by the first cDNA cloning, we used the nomenclature of A2BP1 and Fxh in this report. A2BP1 and Fxh have been named A2BP1 and Rbm9, respectively, in the <span class="yellow">human</span> and <span class="yellow">mouse</span> genomes.
We have been studying regulatory mechanisms of neural cell-specific alternative splicing using the non-muscle myosin heavy chain II-B (NMHC-B) gene as a model system (14,26). NMHC-B mRNA is expressed ubiquitously. However, an alternative exon, N30, which encodes a 30 nt coding sequence, is included in the mRNAs from some neural cells, but is skipped in those from all other cells in mammals and birds (27,28). In cultured cells, a switch in N30 splicing from exclusion to inclusion can be seen in neural retinoblastoma Y79 cells during the post-mitotic and differentiated stages triggered by butyrate treatment. We have previously defined an intronic distal downstream enhancer (IDDE), which confers neural cell specificity on N30 inclusion, using this cell line (14). The IDDE includes two copies of UGCAUG. Mutation of these hexanucleotides results in N30 skipping in post-mitotic differentiated Y79 cells.
In this study, we investigated the possible involvement of A2BP1 and Fxh in the regulation of N30 splicing. To this end, we have isolated cDNA clones for A2BP1 and Fxh from brain and muscles. cDNA cloning revealed the existence of tissue-specific (enriched) isoforms of both A2BP1 and Fxh. Of importance, different isoforms of A2BP1 and Fxh show different activities with respect to N30 splicing as well as different subcellular localizations.<br><br>MATERIALS AND METHODS
Database disposition
The sequences reported in this paper have been deposited in the GenBank database with accession numbers AY659951 (F011), AY659952 (F411), AY659953 (F402), AY659954 (A016), AY659955 (A030), AY659956 (A713), AY659957 (A715) and AY659958 (A704).<br><br>RNA preparation and RT–PCR
Total RNAs were isolated from <span class="yellow">mouse</span> tissues and cultured cells using an RNA isolation kit (Stratagene) or an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). To obtain the full-length coding regions of cDNAs for Fxh and A2BP1, RT–PCRs were performed using Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The PCR primers used to obtain all Fxh cDNAs were 5′-ctcaggcctccactagttATGGAGAAAAAGAAAATGGTAACTC-3′ and 5′-ctcaggcctcctctagaaGTAGGGGGCAAATCGGCTGTA-3′. The upstream primers for the brain (A016 and A030) and muscle (A713, A715 and A704) A2BP1 cDNAs were 5′-ctcaggcctccactagtgATGAATTGTGAAAGAGAGCAGCT-3′ and 5′-ctcaggcctccactagtcATGTTGGCGTCGCAAGGAGTCC-3′, respectively, and the downstream primer for all A2BP1 cDNAs was 5′-ctcaggcctcctctagagATATGGAGCAAAACGGTTGTATCC-3′. Lower case letters represent adapter sequences including restriction enzyme sites. 5′ Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed using Marathon-Ready cDNA (BD Biosciences Clontech). For the analysis of minigene and NMHC-B mRNAs, RT–PCRs were performed as described previously (14,26). Sequences of primers P1–P9 shown in Figures 1, 4 and 6 are as follows: P1, 5′-AATTCACCCAGCAACCAGAAT-3′; P2, 5′-TAGAGGGATGTAAGTGTTGATGCC-3′; P3, 5′-CAGAGGGCGGACAGTGTATGGT-3′; P4, 5′-GGCGGCAGGGGCGAGGGCAT-3′; P5, 5′-CCGTGGTCGCACCGTGTACAAC-3′; P6, 5′-CAGCGGCAGTGGCAGGGGTG-3′; P7, 5′-AGGAAGAAAGGACCATAATATTCC-3′; P8, 5′-CCTCCACCCAGCTCCAGTTGT-3′; and P9, 5′-CCTGTAGTTATTAAATCCTTCAAG-3′.<br><br>Preparation of expression constructs and minigenes
The cDNAs of Fxh and A2BP1 were introduced into a plasmid pCS3 + MT, which contains a myc-epitope, and its modified version pCS3 + MT + NLS, which in addition contains the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of the <span class="yellow">SV40</span> large T antigen (26). Minigenes G, J without the IDDE, and H with the wild-type IDDE are the same as minigenes W, D4 and Cm0, respectively in ref. (14). The 201 nt IDDEs with mutations were generated by recombinant PCR using the appropriate primers, which included mutated sequences. The hexanucleotide TGCATG sequences at the 5′ and 3′ sides were changed to GTTACT and ACCTAC, respectively.<br><br>Electrophoresis mobility shift assay
Template DNAs for in vitro RNA transcription were prepared by PCR using the wild-type and mutant IDDEs in the minigenes as templates and an upstream primer that included the T7 promoter sequence at the 5′ end. The probe and competitor RNAs were transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP and a trace amount of [35S]UTPαS, respectively, using a MAXIscript kit (Ambion). Mole concentrations of synthesized RNAs were estimated by radioactivities. Fxh and A2BP1 proteins with a myc tag were synthesized in vitro by using a TNT quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) from pCS3 + MT constructs, which include the SP6 promoter. Binding reactions were carried out in a 10 μl mixture that contains 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 2 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mM DTT, 5 μg tRNA, 1 μl reticulocyte lysate reaction mixture and 15 fmol of probe, on ice for 20–30 min. An aliquot of 5 μg of heparin was added to the reaction 10 min before gel electrophoresis. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 6% polyacrylamide gel using a 0.5× TBE buffer (Invitrogen).<br><br>Cell culture and transfection
The <span class="yellow">human</span> retinoblastoma cell line Y79 was cultured and transfected with DNAs as described previously (14,26). Total amounts of transfected DNAs were adjusted to be constant by addition of the empty vector. Either Lipofectin (Invitrogen) or Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) was used for the transfection. For stable transfection, the pCS3+MT expression constructs were co-transfected with a plasmid carrying a neomycin resistant gene and selected by 0.2 mM geneticin (Invitrogen). For differentiation of Y79 cells, cells were plated on the poly-d-lysine-coated plates and then treated with 2.0–2.5 mM sodium butyrate for 4–5 days. HeLa cells were cultured as described and transfected with DNA using Effectene reagent (14,26).<br><br>Immunoblot analysis
Samples that required both protein and mRNA analysis were split upon harvesting. Total cell proteins were subjected to SDS–PAGE and blotted as described previously (26). The primary antibodies used are monoclonal antibodies to a myc-epitope (Invitrogen) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Clontech). Binding of antibodies was detected with the SuperSignal System (Pierce) or ECL (Amersham).<br><br>Immunofluorescent microscopy
HeLa or Y79 cells grown in a four-chamber glass slide were transfected as described above. Cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde 24–48 h after transfection, and permealized with 0.5% Triton X-100 then blocked with 5% <span class="yellow">goat</span> serum. Primary antibodies used were <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-myc (Invitrogen), <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-NMHC-B (29). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 594 <span class="yellow">goat</span> anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 <span class="yellow">goat</span> anti-<span class="yellow">rabbit</span> IgG (Molecular Probes). DAPI was used for DNA staining. Specimens were mounted in ProLong antifed kit (Molecular Probe). The images were collected using Leica SP confocal microscopy (Leica).<br><br>
RESULTS
Tissue-dependent isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 and their subcellular distribution
The A2BP1 mRNAs are detected almost exclusively in brain and striated muscles (heart and skeletal muscles) in adult <span class="blue">mice</span>, whereas the Fxh mRNAs are expressed in a wide variety of tissues with the highest expression in brain and heart [(21,25) and S. Kawamoto, unpublished data]. These expression profiles prompted us to characterize the mRNAs of A2BP1 and Fxh in brain and muscles. We have cloned cDNAs for two gene transcripts from brain, heart and skeletal muscles by RT–PCR and 5′ RACE. The isolated cDNAs are schematically presented with genomic structures in Figure 1 (for amino acid sequences see also Figure 8). Both gene transcripts are found to undergo tissue-specific alternative splicing. In both cases, brain and striated muscles express unique splice variants generated by mutually exclusive splicing of exons B40 and M43, respectively, which provide different coding sequences in the middle of the carboxyl half of the molecules. Southern blot analysis of the RT–PCR products of the Fxh mRNAs from the different tissues probed by oligonucleotides corresponding to B40 and M43 shows that M43 is exclusively used in heart and skeletal muscles, while B40 is predominantly used in brain (Figure 2A). Digestion of the RT–PCR products of the A2BP1 mRNAs with restriction enzymes unique to B40 and M43 demonstrates that B40 and M43 are used almost exclusively in brain and muscles, respectively (Figure 2B). A2BP1 contains an additional cassette type alternative exon A53, consisting of 53 nt. Inclusion and exclusion of exon A53 results in two different amino acid sequences at the C-terminal region owing to a frame shift. In the case of the A2BP1 gene, moreover, it appears that brain and striated muscle utilize alternative promoters, resulting in different amino acid sequences at the N-terminus. The 5′ RACE of skeletal muscle mRNAs yielded essentially a single species of sequence with 29 unique N-terminal amino acids. The 5′ RACE using brain mRNAs; however, yielded multiple products with multiple deduced amino acid sequences, all of which differ from the muscle amino acid sequence at the very N-terminus. Here, we focus our analysis on a clone containing nine unique amino acids at the N-terminus, which was obtained most frequently. Exon–intron organization of Fxh and A2BP1 shows remarkable similarities and a RRM is encoded in four exons (Figure 1B). Of note is that the significant amounts of Fxh and A2BP1 mRNAs from skeletal muscles are missing a part of the RRM by exon skipping. Typically, as shown in Figure 2C, they lack the 93 nt exon that encodes RNP1, one of the two most critical motifs of the RRM (30). Some of them lack almost the entire RRM (e.g. F402 in Figure 1A).
To examine the subcellular distribution of each isoform of Fxh and A2BP1, myc-tagged proteins were transiently expressed in cultured cells and immunostained with an anti-myc antibody. Initially, HeLa cells were used to investigate subcellular localization, since these cells are more suited for these studies. Representative confocal images are shown in Figure 3A. DAPI and anti-NMHC-B antibodies serve as markers for nuclei and cytoplasm, respectively. As noted, the ratio of protein distributed between nuclei and cytoplasm differs among the proteins. All isoforms of Fxh have a predominant nuclear localization. The brain isoform of A2BP1 without the A53 exon (A016) localizes to both nuclei and cytoplasm, whereas the other brain isoform with the A53 exon (A030) localizes predominantly to cytoplasm with only a minimum being in the nuclei. The relative amounts of both muscle isoforms of A2BP1 (A713 and A715) are somewhat between the amounts of the two brain isoforms. These data are summarized in Figure 1A. The subcellular distribution of representative isoforms (F011, A016 and A030) was also examined in retinoblastoma Y79 cells, which were used as host cells for the transfection experiments in order to characterize splicing activities of Fxh and A2BP proteins (see below). Although Y79 cells have a spherical shape and have only thin cytoplasm, exogenously expressed isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 show a similar subcellular distribution as in HeLa cells (Figure 3B). F011 localizes predominantly to nuclei, A016 to both nuclei and cytoplasm and A030 predominantly to cytoplasm.<br><br>Specific interaction of Fxh and A2BP1 with IDDE via a hexanucleotide UGCAUG
Fxh and A2BP1 share an identical RRM and A2BP1 has been reported to bind specifically to the pentanucleotide GCAUG through this RRM (21). We have previously reported that the IDDE of the NMHC-B transcript, which is indispensable for the regulation of neural cell-specific cassette type exon N30 splicing, has two copies of GCAUG (14). Therefore, we investigated whether Fxh and/or A2BP1 bound to the IDDE. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were carried out using labeled IDDE and in vitro transcribed and translated Fxh and A2BP1, which include a myc-epitope. Since all Fxh and A2BP1 isoforms, except F402 and A704, contain the identical RRM, representative isoforms were analyzed. The expression of F011 in reticulocyte lysate causes the formation of a RNA–protein complex whose migration shift distinguishes it from those of the control reticulocyte lysate (C in Figure 4B, lanes 3 and 10). The unlabeled wild-type IDDE competes with the probe efficiently for the formation of the specific complex C (Figure 4B, lane 4). On the other hand, the mutant mc (Figure 4A), which has a mutation in both copies of UGCAUG, does not (Figure 4B, lane 7). The mutant ma, which has a mutation in the hexanucleotide at the 5′ side, shows less efficient competition, compared with mb, which has a mutation in the 3′ side of the hexanucleotide (Figure 4B, lanes 5 and 6), indicating that the nucleotides at the 5′ side are more important than those at the 3′ side. The presence of an anti-myc antibody, but not a non-specific antibody, inhibits the formation of the specific complex (Figure 4B, lane 8). Synthesis of the full-length F011 protein using a reticulocyte lysate and specificity of the myc antibody for the expressed protein are verified by immunoblot analysis (Figure 4B, lanes 11 and 12). A016 and A030 show essentially identical results to those with F011 (data not shown). These results indicate that Fxh and A2BP1 can bind to the IDDE and that the hexanucleotide UGCAUG is required for their binding.<br><br>Fxh and A2BP1 enhance N30 inclusion in a UGCAUG-dependent manner
To study whether Fxh and A2BP1 regulate neural cell-specific splicing via binding to UGCAUG, the Fxh and A2BP1 expression constructs were co-transfected into retinoblastoma Y79 cells with a number of the reporter minigene constructs, which include the wild-type or a mutant version of UGCAUG in the IDDE (Figure 4A). Minigenes H and J consist of the exons E5, N30 and E6 and their flanking introns with some deletions in the introns. The IDDE with or without mutations in the hexanucleotide is included or excluded between N30 and E6. As described above, each isoform of Fxh and A2BP1 enters the nucleus to a different extent. To see the effects of different proteins on N30 splicing itself, independent of their differential properties in nuclear localization, an exogenous NLS was added to the expressed proteins. Since Fxh and A2BP1 proteins contain the identical RRM, and F011, A016 and A030 all show the same UGCAUG-dependent binding to the IDDE in vitro, F011 and A030 were used for these experiments. Host cells Y79 at the proliferating stage exclude the N30 exon in ∼90% of the endogenous NMHC-B mRNAs (e.g. see Figure 6A, lane 1).
As shown in Figure 4C, the mRNAs derived from minigene J exclude N30 without exogenous expression of Fxh or A2BP1 in Y79 cells, similar to the endogenous NMHC-B mRNAs (Figure 4C, upper panel, lanes 1–5). However, in the presence of exogenous expression of F011 and A030, the N30 inclusion is increased (Figure 4C, upper panel, lanes 7 and 12). The N30 inclusion is absolutely dependent on the presence of the IDDE (Figure 4C, upper panel, lanes 6 and 11). Moreover, mutation of either one of the two copies of UGCAUG (ma, mb) abolishes the inclusion of N30 (Figure 4C, upper panel, lanes 8–10, 13–15). In the context of minigene H, which contains shorter introns, the larger extent of N30 inclusion is induced by either F011 or A030 overexpression (Figure 4C, middle panel, lanes 7 and 12). The N30 inclusion of the minigene H mRNAs also depends on the presence of the IDDE (Figure 4C, middle panel, lanes 6 and 11). Mutation of both copies of UGCAUG (mc) results in a complete loss of N30 inclusion (Figure 4C, middle panel, lanes 10 and 15). The mutant ma shows stronger inhibition of N30 inclusion compared with mb (Figure 4C, middle panel, lanes 8 and 9). This observation is consistent with the competition experiments of the EMSA shown in Figure 4B, indicating that the 5′ hexanucleotide is more important than the 3′ hexanucleotide for binding of Fxh or A2BP1 to the IDDE as well as an activation of N30 splicing. Comparable amounts of F011 and A030 are expressed in each transfection as verified by immunoblots using an anti-myc antibody (Figure 4C, lower panel, lanes 6–17).
Since minigenes J and H lack a portion of the intron between exons N30 and E6 and, therefore, the IDDE is located ∼100 nt downstream of N30, instead of 1.5 kb as in the native gene, we also analyzed the effects of Fxh and A2BP1 on the N30 splicing of the wild-type minigene G, which includes full-length introns among E5, N30 and E6 (Figure 4A). As shown in Figure 4C (right panel), both F011 and A030 are capable of promoting N30 inclusion, with F011 showing a higher activity (Figure 4C, lanes 16 and 17). Although A030 can promote N30 inclusion as efficiently as F011 in the contexts of the minigene J and H transcripts, it can do so less efficiently than F011 in the context of the minigene G transcript. Interpretation of this observation will be discussed below.
Taken together, Fxh and A2BP1 can activate N30 inclusion in an IDDE-dependent manner. The hexanucleotide motif UGCAUG is indispensable for this activation.<br><br>Differential activities of alternatively spliced isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 in promoting N30 inclusion
Both Fxh and A2BP1 mRNAs are expressed in brain and A2BP1 is also expressed in striated muscles and Fxh is expressed in an even wider variety of tissues. As demonstrated above, however, both Fxh and A2BP1 transcripts undergo tissue-dependent alternative splicing, producing muscle-specific and brain-enriched isoforms. Therefore, the relative activity of individual isoform of Fxh and A2BP1 in promoting N30 inclusion was compared using minigene G.
First, in order to evaluate the relative specific activity of each isoform in the splicing reaction separately from its ability to localize to nuclei, an exogenous NLS was included in the expressed protein to equalize the nuclear concentration of the expressed protein in these experiments. Essentially, all of the expressed proteins with the exogenous NLS are localized to the nucleus (data not shown). Therefore, the relative nuclear concentrations of the expressed proteins can be estimated easily by immunoblots. As shown in immunoblots in Figure 5A, similar quantities of proteins are expressed in a dose-dependent manner. Expression of the brain isoform F011 causes a dose-dependent increase in N30 inclusion and the extent of N30 inclusion reaches a plateau with ∼85% of the mRNAs including N30. In contrast, inclusion of N30 promoted by F411, the predominant isoform from skeletal muscles, reaches a plateau with only 40% of the mRNAs. With respect to A2BP1, the brain isoform A030 shows higher activity in N30 inclusion than the muscle isoform A715, which shows almost no activation, as shown in Figure 5A. Including additional isoforms, the activities of individual isoforms with an exogenous NLS in promoting N30 inclusion are shown in Figure 5B (lanes 8–13) and are also summarized in Figure 1A (nls). Special care was taken to ensure that a similar quantity of each protein was expressed and, if not, different amounts were tested to obtain comparable expression. In the presence of the exogenous NLS (nls), F011 and A016 show the highest activities among all isoforms tested. A30 shows a considerably lower activity than A016. Each of the muscle isoforms (F411, A713 and A715) has a lower activity than that of their brain counterparts (F011, A016 and A030, respectively). As expected, isoforms lacking a part or all of the RRM (F402 and A704) have no activity for N30 inclusion.
Next, the splicing activities of the wild-type proteins without an exogenous NLS were examined. Representative data are shown in Figure 5B (lanes 2–7) and the relative activities are summarized in Figure 1A (wt). The protein amounts detected by immunoblots in these experiments represent the total amounts of the proteins distributed to both the nuclei and the cytoplasm. The splicing activities of the wild-type proteins are consistent with the activities that combine the splicing activities of the proteins with the exogenous NLS and the activities of the native proteins to localize to nuclei. In the absence of the exogenous NLS (wt), the brain isoforms F011, and A016 to a lesser extent, are still capable of activating N30 inclusion efficiently. The muscle isoforms for both Fxh and A2BP1 (F411, A713 and A715), as well as the brain isoform A030, show only minimal activities. Therefore, F011 and A016 appear to have the most physiological relevance to N30 splicing activation.<br><br>Overexpression of Fxh and A2BP1 activates N30 inclusion of endogenous NMHC-B mRNAs
The <span class="yellow">human</span> NMHC-B gene consists of 41 constitutive exons and 3 alternative exons. Its pre-mRNA is ∼156 kb in length and it is much more complex than the pre-mRNA from the minigenes. In addition, the minigene pre-mRNAs are driven by a heterologous promoter. Therefore, we next examined if Fxh and A2BP1 were capable of promoting N30 inclusion of the endogenous transcript. Y79 cells were stably transfected with the expression construct for F011 or A016. Both F011 and A016 are enriched in the brain and show higher activation of N30 inclusion in the minigene transcripts. mRNAs encoding endogenous NMHC-B were analyzed by using RT–PCR. As shown in Figure 6, the inclusion of exon N30 with and without another alternative exon, R18, in the endogenous mRNAs is markedly increased in the clones which were stably transfected with the construct for F011 or A016 containing an exogenous NLS (Figure 6, lanes 4 and 5). Although to a lesser extent, transfection of the wild-type constructs without an exogenous NLS also results in a significant increase in N30 inclusion (Figure 6, lanes 2 and 3). Thus, exogenously expressed Fxh and A2BP1 are capable of activating N30 inclusion not only in the transcripts from the minigenes, but also in those from the native NMHC-B gene in Y79 cells.<br><br>Fxh may cooperate with other factor(s) to promote N30 inclusion
To address the role of endogenous Fxh and its potential interaction with other proteins in promoting N30 inclusion, we made use of an isoform of Fxh, F402, which lacks the RRM. The mutant proteins lacking an RRM for other RNA-binding proteins have previously been reported to function in a dominant-negative fashion and inhibit the activities of the wild-type proteins (26,31). Therefore, the effects of F402 on the N30 inclusion of minigene H mRNAs were examined in the context of the Y79 cells treated with butyrate. Upon butyrate treatment, as reported previously, Y79 cells enter in a post-mitotic and differentiated stage, and importantly, the endogenous as well as the minigene mRNAs in those cells include N30 to a large extent, unlike those in the untreated cells that predominantly exclude N30 (14). As shown in Figure 7, in the absence of exogenous expression of F402, large quantities of the mRNAs derived from minigene H-wt, which contains the wild-type IDDE, include N30 (Figure 7, upper panel, lane 4). In contrast, only small quantities of N30 inclusion are detected in the mRNAs from minigene H-mc, which has mutations in both copies of UGCAUG in the IDDE (Figure 7, upper panel, lane 8). Therefore, the butyrate-treated Y79 cells contain factor(s), which are capable of activating the UGCAUG-dependent N30 inclusion. Co-transfection of the wild-type minigene H-wt with the F402 expression construct causes a dose-dependent inhibition of N30 inclusion (Figure 7, lanes 1–3), indicating that F402 has an antagonistic effect on the endogenous factors with respect to N30 inclusion. Notably, the UGCAUG-independent N30 inclusion seen in the mutant minigene H-mc is not affected by the co-expression of F402 (Figure 7, lanes 5–7), indicating that the inhibitory activity of F402 depends on the UGCAUG element. The parallel experiment with the F011 expression construct does not show a significant effect on N30 splicing in either the wild-type or mutant minigene (Figure 7, lanes 9–16). This may be due to the fact that N30 inclusion of the wild-type minigene mRNAs has already reached a maximal level and is consistent with the idea that butyrate-treated Y79 cells contain sufficient amounts of protein(s) functionally equivalent to F011, which can promote N30 inclusion in a UGCAUG-dependent manner. Since F402 does not bind to the UGCAUG element, and has a UGCAUG-dependent antagonistic effect on N30 splicing, it most probably disrupts protein–protein interactions of the endogenous proteins that are required for the UGCAUG-dependent activation of N30 splicing. Endogenous Fxh (and/or A2BP1) would be a good candidate whose function could be antagonized by exogenously expressed F402. Thus, this observation suggests that the endogenous Fxh has an effect on the activation of N30 splicing and that other proteins cooperate with Fxh for N30 activation. Since muscle cells express the RRM-defective isoforms to a significant extent (Figure 2C) and the wild-type F402 localize to nuclei efficiently, this also raises the possibility that the RRM-defective isoforms may have an inhibitory function on the N30 splicing in muscle cells.<br><br>
DISCUSSION
Two major findings are described in this report. First, Fxh and A2BP1 facilitate neural cell-specific inclusion of the cassette-type exon via binding to the specific intronic sequence UGCAUG. In addition to a minigene model system, Fxh and A2BP1 are capable of facilitating N30 inclusion of the endogenous pre-mRNA. This result provides an important demonstration of physiological relevance and supports the notion that the NMHC-B pre-mRNA is likely to be the true target for Fxh or A2BP1-mediated regulation. However, whether the endogenous Fxh or A2BP1 regulates endogenous NMHC-B pre-mRNA splicing needs to be determined in a future study. In vertebrates, small interfering RNAs and gene targeting strategies have recently been used successfully to address the roles of endogenous splicing regulators in alternative splicing of endogenous target pre-mRNAs (8,32–36). A second and more novel finding is the identification of tissue-specific isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 with different splicing activities as well as different subcellular localizations. This finding raises the possibility that the products of the Fxh and A2BP1 genes can contribute to a mechanism as to how tissue specificity of alternative splicing is achieved.
Many splicing factors are detected not only in the nuclei, but also in the cytoplasm (37). They are shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and, in some instances, extracellular stimuli trigger changes in subcellular distribution of these proteins. Such translocations have been reported for hnRNPA1 and PTB (38,39). Moreover, a number of RNA-binding proteins have been demonstrated to play a role in multiple steps during gene expression in different subcellular compartments, such as pre-mRNA processing in nuclei, mRNA export from nuclei to cytoplasm and mRNA localization, stability and translation in cytoplasm (37,40). Therefore, not surprisingly, Fxh and A2BP1 isoforms were found to be distributed in both the nuclei and the cytoplasm in HeLa and Y79 cells. However, the relative ratios of proteins distributed between the two subcellular compartments at steady-state differ among the isoforms. In agreement with Jin et al. (21), substantial amounts of the brain isoform A016 are detected in nuclei. Other A2BP1 isoforms, the brain isoform A030 and the muscle isoforms A713 and A715, are only poorly detected in nuclei. This observation is consistent with the reports where endogenous A2BP1 in cerebellar Purkinje cells, hippocampus neurons and cardiac myocytes were shown to be localized essentially to the cytoplasm (23,24). Thus, inclusion and exclusion of A53 and differences in the very N-terminal sequences results in A2BP1 isoforms with a distinct subcellular localization. It is likely that A2BP1 proteins have multiple roles, involving both nuclear and cytoplasmic events. In contrast, all three Fxh isoforms predominantly localized to the nuclei. Therefore, in terms of their localization, Fxh proteins are better candidates for regulators of the pre-mRNA splicing that takes place in nuclei. Of note, however, our preliminary results of 5′ RACE, as well as the EST database, detect multiple 5′ end sequences for both Fxh and A2BP1 mRNAs, which are presumably generated by alternative promoters and alternative splicing. The diversity of the 5′ end cDNA sequences leads to the generation of a number of unique N-terminal amino acid sequences. Therefore, this study does not exclude the possible existence of other isoforms with different subcellular localizations for both Fxh and A2BP1. Our study also does not exclude the possibility that some of the isoforms translocate between the nucleus and the cytoplasm following stimuli.
The main aim of this study is to determine the relative activities of tissue-dependent isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 in neural cell-specific and UGCAUG element-dependent alternative splicing. To obtain an indication of the relative specific activity of each isoform in transfected cells, the same amounts of the expressed proteins should be available for the splicing reaction in the nuclei. For this reason, an exogenous NLS was included in the expressed proteins. Essentially, all of the expressed proteins with the exogenous NLS localized to nuclei. Thus, the amounts of the expressed proteins determined by immunoblots represent the nuclear concentrations. The analysis using the proteins expressed with the exogenous NLS allowed us to compare directly the splicing activities of these proteins. Furthermore, this analysis also allowed us to define the critical regions of the proteins for splicing activation.
As shown in Figure 5, the splicing activities of the various isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 are intrinsically different, regardless of the subcellular localization properties of the wild-type proteins. Among the isoforms tested in this study, F011 and A016, which include B40, are found to have higher activities in promoting N30 inclusion. When the primary amino acid sequences, outside of the RRM, of these two proteins are compared, the C-terminal regions (amino acids 190–377 of F011) show a higher homology with 71% identity, whereas the N-terminal regions (amino acids 1–112 of F011) show only 53% identity. The C-terminal region includes four subregions of nearly identical stretches of amino acids (Figure 8, I–IV). One subregion (II) includes 13 amino acids encoded by exon B40. Substitution of this subregion with exon M43 in Fxh causes substantial changes in amino acid sequences resulting in only a 21% identity in this region between F011 and F411. Another subregion (IV) is located at the C-terminal end and A030 lacks this homologous region by the inclusion of exon A53, which results in a frame shift. Since F411 and A030 show poor splicing activation compared with F011 and A016, respectively, these two subregions of F011 and A016 appear to serve as activation domains, presumably by interacting with other proteins. This notion is supported by the finding that the RRM-lacking isoform F402, which includes the same subregions II and IV as F011, functions apparently as a dominant-negative mutant to the wild-type Fxh, consistent with the interpretation that the mutant and wild-type are competing to interact with other protein(s). To date, Fyn tyrosine kinase and estrogen receptor-α have been reported to interact with Fxh, and ataxin-2 with A2BP1 (23,41,42). Whether these proteins participate in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing is currently unknown. Of interest, A030 with the exogenous NLS activates N30 splicing as efficiently as F011 in the pre-mRNAs derived from minigenes J and H, which contain the shorter intron, whereas this isoform poorly activates N30 splicing in the pre-mRNA from minigene G, which contains the full-length intron. This observation implies that the interactions of A030 with different factors are required in the different pre-mRNA contexts. Therefore, the isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 described here may have different effects on other UGCAUG-regulated alternative splicing.
The involvement of the hexanucleotide UGCAUG in regulated alternative splicing has been experimentally demonstrated in a number of neural cell-specific, as well as other tissue-specific, model systems (13–21). This hexanucleotide element plays a role, in most cases, as an enhancer in regulating alternative splicing of cassette-type exons as well as mutually exclusive exons. Furthermore, computational analysis has revealed that UGCAUG is over-represented in the introns in which splicing is regulated, compared with the constitutively spliced introns (43). This analysis also pointed to the UGCAUG element as playing a role in the regulation of tissue-specific alternative splicing in a wide range of tissues, but not in specific tissues.
To date, KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP) (44), A2BP1 (21) and Fxh (this study) are known to be capable of binding to UGCAUG. KSRP is expressed ubiquitously and tissue-specific variants of this gene have not been described so far. In this study, we have described the existence of tissue-dependent isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1, which, while not identical in some areas of the molecule, may contain the same RRM. The physiological relevance of these isoforms is that they have different splicing activities and different subcellular localizations. The brain isoforms promote N30 inclusion more efficiently than the muscle isoforms of both Fxh and A2BP1. The isoforms lacking the RRM are normally expressed to a significant extent in skeletal muscles. This isoform is incapable of activating N30 splicing and, moreover, can inhibit N30 inclusion. The properties of these isoforms are consistent with Fxh and A2BP1 acting as regulators for N30 splicing, since N30 is included in neuronal cells, but excluded in muscles. Therefore, despite the tissue-independent occurrence of UGCAUG as a regulatory element, given the tissue-dependent isoforms of the UGCAUG-binding proteins (Fxh and A2BP1) with different activities, the hexanucleotide UGCAUG could confer tissue specificity on regulated splicing. One of the major problems in understanding the mechanisms responsible for alternative pre-mRNA splicing is the manner in which tissue specificity is determined. In vertebrates, to date, only a few tissue-specific proteins have been identified as splicing regulators (8–12). Here, we have shown that the tissue-dependent isoforms of the sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins, which themselves are generated by alternative splicing, have different activities in tissue-specific alternative splicing of target pre-mRNA. Therefore, these isoforms play a role in the determination of tissue specificity of target pre-mRNA splicing. The discovery of these tissue-dependent isoforms of the UGCAUG-binding proteins with different splicing activities adds an important new dimension to the molecular mechanisms responsible for regulating tissue-dependent alternative splicing mediated via UGCAUG.<br><br>
<h3>pmcA1779441</h3>Identification of a <span class="yellow">human</span> peripheral blood monocyte subset that differentiates into osteoclasts
Abstract
Increased bone resorption mediated by osteoclasts causes various diseases such as osteoporosis and bone erosion in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Osteoclasts are derived from the monocyte/macrophage lineage, but the precise origin remains unclear. In the present study, we show that the purified CD16- <span class="yellow">human</span> peripheral blood monocyte subset, but not the CD16+ monocyte subset, differentiates into osteoclast by stimulation with receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) in combination with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). Integrin-β3 mRNA and the integrin-αvβ3 heterodimer were only expressed on CD16- monocytes, when they were stimulated with RANKL + M-CSF. Downregulation of β3-subunit expression by small interfering RNA targeting β3 abrogated osteoclastogenesis from the CD16- monocyte subset. In contrast, the CD16+ monocyte subset expressed larger amounts of tumor necrosis factor alpha and IL-6 than the CD16- subset, which was further enhanced by RANKL stimulation. Examination of RA synovial tissue showed accumulation of both CD16+ and CD16- macrophages. Our results suggest that peripheral blood monocytes consist of two functionally heterogeneous subsets with distinct responses to RANKL. Osteoclasts seem to originate from CD16- monocytes, and integrin β3 is necessary for osteoclastogenesis. Blockade of accumulation and activation of CD16- monocytes could therefore be a beneficial approach as an anti-bone resorptive therapy, especially for RA.<br><br>Introduction
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation and proliferation of the synovium in multiple joints. A large number of inflammatory cells, including T cells, B cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, accumulate in the affected synovium, and these inflammatory cells, together with fibroblast-like synoviocytes, express various cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), IL-6 and receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), which are known to induce differentiation and activation of osteoclasts. The inflammatory synovial tissue, known as pannus, invades the articular bone and causes focal bone erosion, which is the hallmark of RA. Histopathologically, osteoclasts are present at the interface of the pannus and bone. Interestingly, the deletion of RANKL or c-Fos gene, which is important for osteoclastogenesis, results in minimal bone destruction in <span class="yellow">mouse</span> models of arthritis [1,2]. Furthermore, other studies indicated that inhibition of osteoclastogenesis by osteoprotegerin, a decoy receptor for RANKL, limits bone destruction in experimental models of arthritis. These studies suggest that osteoclasts are involved in focal bone erosion in RA [3].
Osteoclasts are derived from the monocyte/macrophage lineage. It is reported that osteoclast precursors reside in <span class="yellow">human</span> peripheral blood monocytes [4,5]. A marked increase of the circulating osteoclast precursors was demonstrated in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with erosive psoriatic arthritis as well as in arthritic TNFα transgenic <span class="blue">mice</span> [6,7]. It was also shown that peripheral monocytes differentiate into osteoclasts when seeded on RANKL/osteoclast differentiation factor-producing RA synovial fibroblasts [8]. In addition, RA synovial macrophages thought to originate from peripheral blood monocytes were shown to differentiate into osteoclasts [9,10]. Monocytes are therefore involved not only in synovial inflammation, but also in bone remodeling as potential precursors for synovial macrophages and osteoclasts.
<span class="yellow">Human</span> peripheral blood monocytes consist of two major subsets, CD16+ and CD16-, comprising 5–10% and 90–95% of the monocytes, respectively. These two subsets exhibit different chemotaxis activities and potential of cytokine production [11,12]. Moreover, activation of the Toll-like receptor induces distinct subsets, CD1b+ dendritic cells and DC-SIGN+ (dendritic cell-specific C-type lectin ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin) macrophages from CD16+ and CD16- monocytes, respectively [13]. It has not been revealed, however, which monocyte subset develops into osteoclasts.
In the present study, we determined the <span class="yellow">human</span> peripheral blood monocyte subset that differentiates into osteoclasts, and revealed that each subset exhibits a different response for osteoclastogenic stimuli.<br><br>Materials and methods
Purification of peripheral blood monocytes
Peripheral blood monocytes from healthy donors were collected using Ficoll-Conray (Imuuno-Biological Laboratories, Gunma, Japan) gradient centrifugation. Negative selection of monocytes was performed using MACS microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA, USA) according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer.
The purified monocytes were separated into two subsets, CD16+ and CD16- monocytes, using CD16 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec). Flow cytometry analysis using FITC-conjugated <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-CD14 mAb (MY4; Bechman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA) and phycoerythin-conjugated <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-CD16 mAb (3G8; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) showed that the purities of the CD16+ and CD16- monocytes were more than 90% and 92%, respectively.
For the other experiment, monocytes were purified using CD14 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec), and then stained either with FITC-conjugated <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-CD33 mAb (MY9; Bechman Coulter) or phycoerythin-conjugated <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-CD16 mAb (3G8). Cell sorting of the stained cells was performed using a FACS Vantage cytometer (BD Biosciences) or a MoFlo cell sorter (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark).<br><br>Osteoclast differentiation
Purified CD16+ and CD16- monocytes (5 × 104 cells/well) were incubated in 96-well plates in αMEM (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) with heat-inactivated 10% fetal <span class="yellow">bovine</span> serum (FBS) (Sigma) or with Ultra-Low IgG FBS (IgG < 5 μg/ml; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and where indicated with M-CSF + RANKL (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA).
For the other experiments, varied numbers of CD16+ monocytes (1 × 103, 2.5 × 103, 5 × 103) were mixed with CD16- monocytes (5 × 104 cells/well), and were cultured in 96-well plates in αMEM with heat-inactivated 10% FBS. The medium was replaced with fresh medium 3 days later, and after incubation for 7 days the cells were stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) expression using a commercial kit (Hokudo, Sapporo, Japan). The number of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells (MNC) in three randomly selected fields examined at 100× magnification or the total number of TRAP-positive MNC per well was counted under light microscopy.<br><br>Resorption assay
Monocytes were seeded onto plates coated with calcium phosphate thin films (Biocoat Osteologic; BD Biosciences) and were incubated with RANKL (40 ng/ml) + M-CSF (25 ng/ml) for 7 days. The cells were then lysed in bleach solution (6% NaOCl, 5.2% NaCl). The resorption lacunae were examined under light microscopy.<br><br>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
Purified monocytes were cultured in 96-well plates where indicated either with RANKL or M-CSF for 24 hours. Concentrations of TNFα and IL-6 in the culture supernatant were measured with an ELISA kit (BioSourse International, Camarillo, CA, USA). For experiments of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and TRAP-5b, culture supernatants were collected on day 7 and the concentrations of these enzymes were measured using an MMP-9 ELISA kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) or a TRAP-5b ELISA kit (Suomen, Turku, Finland).<br><br>Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
Monocytes (1 × 106 cells/well) were cultured in six-well plates with M-CSF alone or with M-CSF + RANKL for 3 days. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Micro (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The RNA was then treated with DNase I (Qiagen). The oligo(dT)-primed cDNA was synthesized using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The amount of cDNA for amplification was adjusted by the amount of RNA measured by an optical density meter and also by β-actin or GAPDH PCR products. One microliter of cDNA was amplified in a 50 μl final volume containing 25 pmol appropriate primer pair, 10 pmol each of the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates, and 5 units FastStart Taq DNA Polymerase (Roche, Manheim, Germany) in a thermal cycler (PTC-200; MJ GeneWorks, Waltham, MA, USA).
The PCR conditions were 25–40 cycles of denaturation (95°C for 30 s), annealing (60–62°C for 1 min) and extension (72°C for 1 min). The sequences of the primers are presented in Table 1. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis through 2% agarose gel.<br><br>Western immunoblot analysis
Purified monocytes were cultured for 3 days in the presence of 40 ng/ml M-CSF with or without 25 ng/ml RANKL. Cells were lysed in RIPA Lysis buffer (upstate, Lake Placid, NY, USA) containing protease inhibitors (Roche) for 15 min at 4°C. A total of 20 μg protein was boiled in the presence of 6 × sodium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer, and was separated on 7.5% or 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan). Proteins were then electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride microporous membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) in a semidry system. Membranes were incubated in 10% skim milk prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20, and were subjected to immunoblotting. Antibodies used were <span class="yellow">goat</span> anti-RANK antibody (Techne Corporation, Minneapolis, MN, USA), <span class="yellow">goat</span> anti-c-fms antibody (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), and <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-β-actin mAb (AC-15; Sigma). Peroxidase-conjugated <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-<span class="yellow">goat</span> IgG antibody (Dako) or peroxidase-conjugated <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> IgG antibody (Dako) was used as the second antibody. The signals were visualized by chemiluminescence reagent (ECL; Amersham Biocsiences, Little Chalfont, UK).<br><br>Cell surface expression of c-fms
The following mAbs were used for analysis of c-fms expression: Alexa 647-conjugated anti-CD14 mAb (UCHM1; Serotec, Oxford, UK), FITC-conjugated anti-CD16 mAb (3G8; Bechman Coulter) and phycoerythin-conjugated anti-c-fms mAb (61708; R&D systems). Alexa 647-conjugated <span class="yellow">mouse</span> IgG2a (Serotec), FITC-conjugated <span class="yellow">mouse</span> IgG1 (BD Biosciences) and phycoerythin-conjugated <span class="yellow">mouse</span> IgG1 (Bechman Coulter) were used as isotype controls. Peripheral blood monocytes (1 × 105 cells) were incubated with 1 μg <span class="yellow">human</span> IgG for 15 minutes, and were then stained with three fluorochrome-labeled mAbs for 45 minutes on ice. The stained cells were analyzed with a FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences).<br><br>Immunofluorescent staining
Monocytes (8 × 104 cells/well) were allowed to adhere on 96-well plates overnight or were cultured with M-CSF and RANKL for 2–4 days. The cells were fixed in acetone and then stained with anti-αvβ3 mAb (LM609; Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA) or <span class="yellow">mouse</span> IgG1 (11711; R&D Systems) as an isotype-matched control. Alexa fluor546-conjugated <span class="yellow">goat</span> anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> IgG1 antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) was used as the second antibody. TOTO-3 (Molecular Probes) was used for nuclear staining.<br><br>Flow cytometric analysis of p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation
Purified monocytes were cultured in the presence of 25 ng/ml M-CSF for 3 days, and were either left unstimulated or were stimulated with 40 ng/ml RANKL at 37°C. Stimulations were stopped by adding an equal volume of PhosFlow Fix Buffer I solution (BD Biosciences) to the cell culture. After incubation for 10 minutes at 37°C, the cells were permeabilized by washing twice at room temperature in PhosFlow Perm/Wash Buffer I (BD Biosciences). A total of 1 × 105 cells was then Fc blocked with 1 μg <span class="yellow">human</span> IgG for 15 minutes, and was stained with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated mAb either to phospho-p38 MAPK (T180/Y182) or to phospho-ERK1/2 (T202/Y204) (BD Biosciences) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated <span class="yellow">mouse</span> IgG1 (BD Biosciences) was used as an isotype control. The cells were washed in PhosFlow Perm/Wash Buffer I, and were analyzed by flow cytometry, as already described.<br><br>RNA interference
RNA oligonucleotides (iGENE, Tsukuba, Japan) were designed based on the algorithm that incorporates single nucleotide polymorphism and homology screening to ensure a target-specific RNA interference effect. The following sense and antisense oligonucleotides were used: integrin β3, 5'-GCU UCA AUG AGG AAG UGA AGA AGC A-AG and 3'-UA-CGA AGU UAC UCC UUC ACU UCU UCG U; randomized control, 5'-CGA UUC GCU AGA CCG GCU UCA UUG C-AG and 3'-UA-GCU AAG CGA UCU GGC CGA AGU AAC G; and lamin, 5'-GAG GAA CUG GAC UUC CAG AAG AAC A-AG and 3'-UA-CUC CUU GAC CUG AAG GUC UUC UUG U.
CD16- monocytes (8 × 104 cells/well) were incubated in 96-well plates in optimem (Invitrogen). After 1 hour, siRNAs were transfected into the cells using oligofectamine (Qiagen) based on the method recommended by the manufacturer. After 2 hours, the cells were washed once with PBS, followed by the addition of αMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, M-CSF and RANKL. After a 2-day incubation, the β3 mRNA expression was analyzed by RT-PCR with different PCR cycles, as described earlier. Immunofluorescent staining for the αvβ3 heterodimer was also performed as described above, and numbers of αvβ3-positive cells were counted in randomly selected three fields at 100× magnification. Seven days after the transfection of siRNAs, the number of TRAP-positive MNC in five fields examined at 100× magnification was counted under light microscopy.<br><br>Inhibition of osteoclastogenesis with cyclic RGDfV peptide
CD16- monocytes were incubated in 96-well plates with M-CSF + RANKL for 2 days. A medium containing either cyclic RGDfV peptide (Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Val) (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) or dimethyl sulfoxide was then added. After incubation for a further 5 days, the number of TRAP-positive MNC in five fields examined at 100× magnification was counted under light microscopy.<br><br>Immunohistochemistry
Synovial tissue samples were obtained during total knee joint replacement surgery from four RA <span class="yellow">patients</span>. Signed consent forms were obtained before the operation. The experimental protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Tokyo Medical and Dental University. RA was diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria [14].
Double immunofluorescent staining for CD68 and CD16 antigens was conducted on optimal cutting temperature-embedded sections of frozen synovial samples. Eight-micrometer-thick cryostat sections of RA synovium were fixed in acetone for 3 minutes and were then rehydrated in PBS for 5 minutes. The samples were incubated in 5 μg/ml proteinase K (Roche), 50 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, 100 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, for 15 minutes at room temperature followed by a wash in PBS. The samples were then blocked with 10% <span class="yellow">goat</span> serum in PBS for 60 minutes at room temperature, and were incubated with anti-CD16 mAb (3G8; Immunotech, Marseille, France) or <span class="yellow">mouse</span> IgG1 (11711) as an isotype-matched control in 1% <span class="yellow">bovine</span> serum albumin/PBS for 60 minutes at room temperature. The samples were then washed three times in PBS, for 5 minutes each, and incubated with Alexa fluor546-conjugated <span class="yellow">goat</span> anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> IgG1 antibody (Molecular Probes) in 1% <span class="yellow">bovine</span> serum albumin/PBS for 60 minutes at room temperature. The samples were then sequentially stained for CD68 antigen in a manner similar to that used for CD16 staining. The samples were stained with anti-CD68 mAb (PGM1; Immunotech) or <span class="yellow">mouse</span> IgG3 (6A3; MBL, Nagoya, Japan) followed by labeling with Alexa fluor488-conjugated <span class="yellow">goat</span> anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> IgG3 antibody (Molecular Probes). The samples were examined by confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).<br><br>Statistical analysis

Results
Induction of osteoclasts from CD16- peripheral blood monocytes
To identify the monocyte subset that differentiates into osteoclasts, we examined osteoclast formation from CD16+ and CD16- <span class="yellow">human</span> peripheral blood monocytes. The monocyte subsets were purified using magnetic beads. Incubation with M-CSF alone did not induce osteoclast formation from either subset (Figure 1a). Culture with M-CSF + RANKL induced a significant number of TRAP-positive MNC from the CD16- subset, whereas only few CD16+ monocytes differentiated into TRAP-positive MNC (Figure 1a,b). We then assessed the bone resorptive ability by culturing cells on calcium phosphate-coated plates with M-CSF + RANKL. Resorption lacunae were detected only in the CD16- subset (Figure 1c), indicating the TRAP-positive CD16--derived MNC possessed the osteoclast phenotype.
Similar results were obtained using purified monocytes by FACS sorting (purities: CD16+, 96%; CD16-, 97%). The number of TRAP-positive MNC induced were 36 ± 3 cells/well and 348 ± 13 cells/well from CD16+ and CD16- monocytes, respectively. To exclude the possibility that the anti-CD16 antibody used for isolation of CD16+ monocytes inhibits osteoclast formation, we separated the two subsets, CD33low monocytes and CD33high monocytes, using anti-CD33 mAb and a fluorescent cell sorter, since it was reported that CD33low monocytes correspond to CD16+, and that CD33high correspond to CD16- monocytes [15]. On average, the CD33low population contained CD16- (10.2%)/CD16+ (89.8%) monocytes, and the CD33high population contained CD16- (86.3%)/CD16+ (13.7%) monocytes.
Culture with M-CSF + RANKL induced TRAP-positive MNC from CD33high monocytes, whereas no or few CD33low monocytes differentiated into TRAP-positive MNC (CD33low vs CD33high, 2 ± 1 vs 192 ± 71 cells/well; n = 3). TRAP-5b and MMP-9 in the culture supernatants, both of which are known to be produced by osteoclasts, were measured by ELISA. The concentrations of both enzymes were significantly higher in the culture supernatant of CD16- monocytes than in that of CD16+ monocytes (Figure 1d). These results suggest that the CD16- peripheral blood monocyte subset, but not the CD16+ subset, differentiate into osteoclasts by incubation with RANKL + M-CSF.<br><br>CD16+ monocytes do not affect the osteoclastogenesis from CD16- monocytes
To examine whether CD16+ monocytes affect osteoclastogenesis from CD16- monocytes, varied numbers of CD16+ monocytes were mixed with CD16- monocytes (5 × 104 cells/well), and were cultured for 7 days in the presence of M-CSF + RANKL. The number of TRAP-positive MNC was not altered by the presence of CD16+ monocytes (Figure 2). The results indicated that CD16+ monocytes did not hamper or enhance the osteoclastogenesis from CD16- monocytes.<br><br>Differences in cytokine production by RANKL-stimulated or M-CSF-stimulated CD16+ and CD16- monocytes
To compare the biological response of CD16+ and CD16- subsets with either RANKL or M-CSF stimulation, we measured the amount of TNFα and IL-6 production after exposure of cells to various concentrations of RANKL or M-CSF with an ELISA. Without RANKL the CD16+ subset produced a significant amount of TNFα and IL-6, whereas the CD16- subset produced undetectable levels (Figure 3a). RANKL stimulation increased TNFα production from both subsets in a dose-dependent manner, although the CD16+ subset produced more TNFα than did the CD16- subset. RANKL stimulation also enhanced IL-6 production from the CD16+ subset, but not from the CD16- subset. M-CSF stimulation increased TNFα and IL-6 production from both subsets, although the CD16+ subset produced more than the CD16- subset (Figure 3b).
These results suggest that CD16+ monocytes also respond both to RANKL and M-CSF stimulation, although such stimulation does not result in differentiation into osteoclasts. CD16+ monocytes were also noted to express higher amounts of inflammatory cytokines compared with CD16- monocytes with or without RANKL or M-CSF stimulation.<br><br>Comparison of expression levels of molecules involved in osteoclastogenesis between CD16+ and CD16- monocytes
Diverse molecules are involved in RANKL/RANK and its costimulatory signal transduction pathways [16]. The different response to RANKL + M-CSF stimulation between the CD16+ monocyte subset and the CD16- monocytes subset might be explained by the expression profiles of these molecules. We therefore examined the mRNA levels of the following molecules: receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK), the receptor for RANKL; c-fms, the receptor for M-CSF; tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF-6), the adaptor protein for RANK; c-Fos and nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1), transcription factors that are essential for osteoclastogenesis; DNAX-activation protein 12 (DAP12) and Fc receptor γ chain (FcRγ), adaptor proteins known to deliver costimulatory signals in RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis; signal regulatory protein β1 (SIRP-β1), triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM-2) and osteoclast-associated receptor (OSCAR), transmembrane receptors that associate with either DAP12 or FcRγ; and αv and β3, integrins known to be expressed as the αvβ3 heterodimer on osteoclasts.
The mRNA levels of RANK, c-fms, TRAF-6, DAP12 and SIRP-β1 under the baseline condition (no stimulation) varied between the donors; however, we did not find consistent differences in the mRNA levels of these molecules between the CD16+ monocyte subset and the CD16- monocyte subset among three to six donors (Figure 4a). The mRNA levels of other molecules, apart from integrin β3, were similar between the two subsets under the no-stimulation condition. Although the mRNA levels of RANK, c-fms, DAP12, FcRγ, TREM-2 and OSCAR increased in response to M-CSF alone or M-CSF + RANKL in both subsets, the expression levels were not significantly different between the two subsets. Expressions of TRAF-6, c-Fos and SIRP-β1 mRNA did not change following stimulation with M-CSF + RANKL. Of note, the expression of NFATc1 mRNA was enhanced by M-CSF + RANKL treatment only in the CD16- subset. Furthermore, expression of integrin αv in both subsets was enhanced by M-CSF with or without RANKL; however, the expression level was greater in the CD16- subset. It was noted that integrin-β3 mRNA was detected only in the CD16- subset and was increased by M-CSF + RANKL stimulation, but not by M-CSF alone. The protein expression of RANK under the baseline condition was weakly detected in both subsets, and the levels were varied between donors by western immunoblotting.
The protein expression of c-fms was weakly detected in unstimulated CD16+ monocytes, but not in CD16- monocytes (Figure 4b). Flow cytometry analysis of c-fms in fresh monocytes, however, showed that both subsets express the molecule on the cell surface (Figure 4c). Expressions of both RANK and c-fms were upregulated by M-CSF alone and by M-CSF + RANKL, and we did not find consistent differences in the protein levels of these molecules between the two monocyte subsets. The profiles of expression levels of molecules involved in RANKL/RANK and its costimulatory pathways are similar between the two subsets, except for NFATc1, integrin αv and integrin β3. We therefore assumed that the distinct induction of NFATc1, integrin αv and integrin β3 in response to RANKL stimulation among the two monocyte subsets might explain the differences in their abilities to differentiate into osteoclasts.<br><br>RANKL stimulation induces αvβ3 expression on CD16- monocytes
The integrin-β3 subunit binds to integrin αv only and is expressed as the heterodimeric protein αvβ3 on monocytes and osteoclasts [17]. We examined the expression of αvβ3 on CD16+ and CD16- monocytes by immunofluorescent staining. Neither unstimulated nor M-CSF-stimulated monocyte subsets expressed αvβ3 (Figure 4d and data not shown). After 48 and 72 hours of treatment with M-CSF + RANKL, αvβ3-positive mononuclear cells were observed in CD16- monocyte cultures but not in CD16+ monocyte cultures. At 96 hours, both αvβ3-positive mononuclear cells and multinucleated cells were present in the CD16- monocyte culture. The results indicated that αvβ3 was selectively expressed on CD16- monocytes in the presence of M-CSF + RANKL, and the expression was revealed before the cells differentiate into typical multinucleated osteoclasts.<br><br>RANKL activates ERK and p38 kinases only in CD16- monocytes
Since ERK and p38 MAPK are essential in RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis [18-20], we next examined whether these kinases were activated differently in CD16+ monocytes and in CD16- monocytes. Purified monocytes were precultured with 25 ng/ml M-CSF for 3 days to enhance RANK expression, and were then treated with RANKL. The RANKL treatment induced phosphorylation of both ERK and p38 MAPK in CD16- monocytes at 5 minutes postexposure, although the p38 MAPK phosphorylation was weak. Both phosphorylations declined to a basal level within 20 minutes (Figure 5). In contrast, ERK and p38 MAPK were not detectably phosphorylated in CD16+ monocytes with RANKL.<br><br>siRNA targeting integrin β3 inhibits osteoclastogenesis from CD16- monocytes
The integrin-β3 cytoplasmic domain is essential for activation of intracellular signals from αvβ3 heterodimers [17]. We therefore examined the involvement of αvβ3 in RANKL + M-CSF-induced osteoclastogenesis in <span class="yellow">human</span> CD16- monocytes using siRNA targeting the integrin-β3 subunit. The integrin-β3 siRNA or control randomized siRNA were transfected into CD16- monocytes. At 48 hours post-transfection, we determined the integrin-β3 mRNA level and αvβ3 heterodimer protein expression. The integrin-β3 mRNA level was reduced in the integrin-β3 siRNA-transfected monocytes compared with control siRNA-transfected monocytes (Figure 6a). The αvβ3 heterodimer expression was evaluated by immunofluorescent staining. The number of αvβ3-positive cells was significantly decreased in integrin-β3 siRNA-transfected monocytes compared with that in control siRNA (Figure 6b).
After 7 days of incubation, the number of TRAP-positive MNC was counted. Transfection with integrin-β3 siRNA significantly reduced the number of TRAP-positive MNC in a dose-dependent manner compared with control siRNA transfection (Figure 6c). In addition, the use of siRNA directed toward a different site of integrin-β3 mRNA also inhibited osteoclast formation from CD16- monocytes (data not shown). On the other hand, siRNA that targeted lamin, which was used as a negative control, did not inhibit the induction of osteoclasts (data not shown). These results indicate the importance of integrin β3 in RANKL-induced osteoclast formation from CD16- peripheral blood monocytes.<br><br>Cyclic RGDfV peptide inhibits the osteoclastogenesis from CD16- monocytes
Integrin αvβ3 recognizes a common tripeptide sequence, RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp), which is present in bone matrix proteins such as vitronectin and fibronectin [21]. Cyclic RGDfV peptide (Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Val) inhibits binding of the RGD-containing molecules to αvβ3 [22]. To investigate the role of ligand binding to the αvβ3 heterodimer in the osteoclastogenesis, we examined whether cyclic RGDfV peptide inhibits the formation of osteoclasts. Cyclic RGDfV peptide significantly reduced the number of TRAP-positive MNC in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6d). The results imply possible involvement of ligand bindings to αvβ3 in the osteoclastogenesis.<br><br>Knockdown of integrin β3 did not affect the expression of NFATc1 mRNA
In the next step, we determined whether integrin-β3-siRNA-induced inhibition of the osteoclastogenesis reflects downregulation of NFATc1, which is a key transcription factor in osteoclastogenesis [23]. For this purpose, we compared NFATc1 mRNA levels between integrin β3 and control siRNA-transfected monocytes. Interestingly, integrin-β3 knockdown did not alter the NFATc1 mRNA level (Figure 7), suggesting that signal transduction mediated by integrin β3 does not affect the expression of NFATc1.<br><br>Detection of CD16+ and CD16- macrophages in synovium of RA <span class="yellow">patients</span>
RA synovial macrophages are derived from peripheral blood monocytes, and their recruitment into the synovium is facilitated by various adhesion molecules and chemokines [24]. To analyze CD16 expression on synovial macrophages, RA synovial tissues were double-stained for CD16 and a macrophage marker, CD68. CD16-/CD68+ macrophages were widespread in the synovium. Although less frequent, CD16+/CD68+ macrophages were also observed both in the synovial intima and subintima (Figure 8). The presence of two subsets of macrophages, CD16+ and CD16-, in RA synovium indicates that both CD16+ and CD16- peripheral blood monocytes are recruited into the synovium.<br><br>
Discussion
<span class="yellow">Human</span> peripheral blood monocytes are a heterogeneous population, and they are divided into two subsets based on the expression of CD16. The CD16+ and CD16- monocyte subsets show functional differences in migration, cytokine production and differentiation into macrophages or dendritic cells [11-13,15]. We focused on the heterogeneity of the monocytes, and the primary question addressed in this study was which monocyte subset could be the source of osteoclasts. The results demonstrated that CD16- peripheral blood monocytes, but not CD16+ monocytes, differentiated in vitro into osteoclasts by treatment with RANKL + M-CSF.
To investigate the molecular mechanisms of the different response to RANKL and the differentiation into osteoclasts between CD16+ and CD16- monocytes, we examined the expression of molecules known to be involved in osteoclastogenesis. The expression profiles of integrin αv, integrin β3 and NFATc1 were different between the two subsets. Integrin αvβ3 heterodimer was expressed only on RANKL and M-CSF-stimulated CD16- monocytes. It is known that αvβ3 expressed on osteoclasts is important in bone resorption as well as in attachment of osteoclasts to the bone matrix [25].
It was recently reported that bone marrow macrophages of integrin-β3-deficient <span class="blue">mice</span> could not differentiate into mature osteoclasts in vitro, suggesting that αvβ3 is involved not only in activation, but also in differentiation, of osteoclasts in <span class="blue">mice</span> [26,27]. The authors also showed that αvβ3 and c-fms share a common intracellular signaling pathway, including the activation of ERK and the induction of c-Fos [27], both of which are essential for osteoclastogenesis [28,29]. In addition, it was reported that echistatin, an αvβ3 antagonist, inhibited osteoclast formation of <span class="yellow">mouse</span> bone marrow cells [30].
In accordance with these reports, our data showed that knockdown of integrin-β3 expression resulted in downregulation of the αvβ3 heterodimer, and abrogated osteoclastogenesis from <span class="yellow">human</span> peripheral blood CD16- monocytes. We also showed that blocking of adhesive ligands to bind to αvβ3 by RGDfV peptide inhibited osteoclast formation from CD16- monocytes. Taken together, the process of ligand binding to αvβ3 may be involved in the osteoclastogenesis. Blockade of αvβ3 could therefore be a therapeutically beneficial approach to modulate osteoclastogenesis. Indeed, integrin αvβ3 antagonists effectively treated osteoporosis in <span class="blue">mice</span>, <span class="yellow">rats</span> and <span class="yellow">humans</span>, and protected bone destruction in <span class="yellow">rat</span> adjuvant-induced arthritis in vivo [31-34]. Of note, it is reported that <span class="yellow">patients</span> with Iraqi-Jewish-type Glanzmann thrombasthenia who are deficient in integrin β3 do not develop osteopetrosis because of the upregulation of α2β1 expression on osteoclasts, although the bone-resorptive ability of the osteoclasts was decreased in vitro [35]. The function of αvβ3 in vivo in osteoclast formation and resorptive function could therefore be partially compensated by other integrins.
Although all the multinucleated osteoclasts expressed αvβ3 (Figure 4d) [36], a small number of M-CSF + RANKL-stimulated mononuclear CD16- monocytes expressed αvβ3 (Figure 4d). Multinucleated osteoclasts are formed by fusion of osteoclast precursor cells [37]. It was reported that αvβ3 is involved in the migration of osteoclast precursors [30]. The αvβ3-positive cells could therefore be forced to migrate by the ligands and may fuse with closed αvβ3-negative cells. Alternatively, only αvβ3-positive cells may be fused with each other.
It is possible to consider that signaling from CD16 by anti-CD16 mAb-coated magnetic beads, which were used for the cell separation, or by IgG contained in FBS might inhibit osteoclastogenesis from CD16+ monocytes. We therefore separated the two subsets using anti-CD33 mAb and a fluorescent cell sorter, and stimulated the cells with M-CSF + RANKL. The results showed that CD33low monocytes, which correspond to CD16+ monocytes, still could not differentiate into osteoclasts. CD16 is a heterodimer consisting of FcγIIIa and Fcγ, and has low affinity for the Fc region of IgG. Aggregation of CD16 by immune complexes leads to transmission of activating signals via the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif in the γ chain [38]. We also assessed osteoclastogenesis from the two monocyte subsets using IgG-depleted <span class="yellow">bovine</span> serum. Even in the IgG-free medium, CD16- monocytes but not CD16+ monocytes differentiated into osteoclasts (data not shown). We could therefore exclude the possibility that signal transduction through CD16 inhibits osteoclastogenesis from CD16+ monocytes.
NFATc1 is a key transcription factor in osteoclastogenesis [16]. In the present study, stimulation with M-CSF + RANKL increased the NFATc1 mRNA expression in the CD16- subset only, similar to integrin αv and integrin β3. The differences in NFATc1 induction might therefore also explain the difference in osteoclastogenesis between the two monocyte subsets. It is of interest that knockdown of integrin β3 did not lower the mRNA level of NFATc1. This result supports the notion that NFATc1 is located upstream of integrin-β3 expression [39]. It is also possible that parallel activation of two signaling pathways mediated by integrin β3 and NFATc1 contributes to osteoclastogenesis independently or cooperatively. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanisms of integrin β3 involvement in RANKL/RANK-mediated osteoclast differentiation.
It has been demonstrated that MAPK families, ERK and p38 MAPK, were activated by RANKL-induced intracellular signalings in osteoclasts and osteoclast precursors [18,19]. In addition, these kinases are involved in the differentiation of osteoclasts [20]. We showed that RANKL stimulation induced phosphorylation of ERK and p38 MAPK only in CD16- monocytes. It is suggested that differential activation of these kinases may partially explain the distinct properties of the two monocyte subsets upon RANKL stimulation.
Our results showed that CD16+ monocytes produce higher levels of inflammatory cytokines including TNFα and IL-6 compared with CD16- monocytes. These results are consistent with the previous report showing that CD16+ monocytes produced larger amounts of TNFα upon lipopolysaccharide or lipopeptide stimulation than did CD16- monocytes [40]. Interestingly, we showed that stimulation either with RANKL or M-CSF upregulated the TNFα and IL-6 production by CD16+ monocytes. A marked increase of CD16+ monocytes in peripheral blood is reported in inflammatory diseases, such as infection, malignancy, Kawasaki disease and RA [41-44]. Taken together, CD16+ monocytes may be an important source of inflammatory cytokines.
In <span class="blue">mice</span>, peripheral blood Ly-6Chigh monocytes, which are thought to correspond to <span class="yellow">human</span> CD16- monocytes, increase in inflammatory conditions, and these cells are recruited into sites of inflammation [45]. In contrast, Ly-6Clow monocytes, which are thought to correspond to <span class="yellow">human</span> CD16+, migrate into noninflamed tissues [12]. These data on <span class="yellow">mouse</span> monocytes seem to be in contrast to the data on <span class="yellow">human</span> monocytes, which show expansion of CD16+ monocytes in inflammatory conditions where they produce larger amounts of inflammatory cytokines. At present, it is not clear whether <span class="yellow">mouse</span> monocyte subsets, Ly-6Clow/Ly-6Chigh, represent <span class="yellow">human</span> monocyte subsets, CD16+/CD16- monocytes, and whether the biologic functions of <span class="yellow">mouse</span> monocytes are analogous to those of <span class="yellow">human</span> monocytes.
In <span class="blue">mice</span>, blood monocytes newly released from the bone marrow are exclusively Ly-6Chigh and the level of Ly-6C is downregulated while in circulation [45]. It is thus suggested that in <span class="blue">mice</span> the two monocyte subsets differing in Ly-6C expression represent different stages in the maturation pathway. In the <span class="yellow">human</span>, transition from CD16- monocytes to CD16+ monocytes is observed upon culture with IL-10, M-CSF and transforming growth factor beta in vitro [42,46]. Similar to <span class="yellow">mouse</span> monocytes, therefore, <span class="yellow">human</span> peripheral blood CD16- monocytes may also maturate into CD16+ monocytes.
It is reported that a significant number of RA synovial cells in the intima express CD16, suggesting that CD16+ cells are synovial macrophages [47]. We confirmed that both CD16+ and CD16- macrophages accumulate in the RA synovium by double-color immunohistochemical staining for CD68 and CD16. A number of chemokines are abundantly expressed in the RA synovium [24,48]. Among these cytokines, MCP-1, MIP-1α, SDF-1, RANTES and fractalkine can induce migration of CD16- monocytes in vitro ([11,12] and unpublished data). On the other hand, migration of CD16+ monocytes is induced only by fractalkine. These chemokines therefore seem to play an important role in recruitment of CD16+ and CD16- monocytes from the circulating pool into the RA synovium.
The osteoclast inducers are also produced in the RA synovium. RANKL is expressed by synovial fibroblasts and activated T cells [49-51], while M-CSF is expressed on RA synovial macrophages and fibroblasts [52,53].
TNFα and IL-6, which are mainly expressed on RA synovial macrophages and fibroblasts, respectively, could also enhance osteoclast differentiation [54]. Collectively, it is probable that the recruited CD16- monocytes/macrophages differentiate into osteoclasts in the RA synovium, and contribute to bone destruction. On the other hand, CD16+ monocytes/macrophages might also be involved in RA pathogenesis by producing inflammatory cytokines including TNFα and IL-6. Since TNFα and IL-6 enhance osteoclast formation [54,55], CD16+ monocytes/macrophages may also contribute to osteoclastogenesis in RA synovium.<br><br>Conclusion
We have shown that <span class="yellow">human</span> peripheral blood monocytes consist of two functionally heterogeneous subsets with distinct response to osteoclastogenic stimuli. Osteoclasts seem to originate from CD16- monocytes, and integrin β3 is necessary for the osteoclastogenesis. The blockade of accumulation and activation of CD16- monocytes could therefore be a beneficial approach as an anti-bone resorptive therapy, especially for RA.<br><br>Abbreviations

<h3>pmcA1805739</h3>Embryonic sympathoblasts transiently express TrkB in vivo and proliferate in response to brain-derived neurotrophic factor in vitro
Abstract
Background
Nerve growth factor and neurotrophin-3 are involved in the development of sympathetic neurons; however, whether brain derived neurotrophic factor also plays a role is not known. The purpose of this study was to determine whether BDNF and its receptor, TrkB, are expressed during the development of paravertebral sympathetic ganglia in vivo and to determine the effect of BDNF in vitro.<br><br>Results
As neural crest cells coalesce to form sympathetic ganglia, TrkB-positive cells are seen in both <span class="yellow">chicken</span> and <span class="yellow">mouse</span> embryos. In <span class="yellow">chicken</span> embryos, TrkB-expressing cells first appear at Hamburger-Hamilton Stage (St) 27 and they co-express HNK-1, confirming that they are migrating neural crest cells. The TrkB-positive cells lack neural markers at this stage; however, they migrate with other neurally differentiating cells that are TrkA and TrkC-positive. By St. 29/30, TrkB-positive cells begin to express the neural specific markers Hu C/D and Islet-1; eventually, all TrkB positive cells commence neural differentiation. By St. 34, TrkB and TrkC staining are lost. BDNF transcript expression parallels that of TrkB. In the <span class="yellow">mouse</span>, TrkB-positive cells surround newly formed sympathetic ganglia and a small number of TrkB positive cells that co-express tyrosine hydroxylase are seen within ganglia between E13.5-15. In cell culture, many cells from St. 29–30 <span class="yellow">chicken</span> lumbar sympathetic ganglia express neural markers and are dividing, indicating that they are sympathoblasts. Sympathoblasts and neurons require both nerve growth factor and neurotrophin-3 for survival. BDNF increases the number of cells expressing neural markers in culture by increasing number of cells that incorporate bromodeoxyuridine. In contrast, most TrkB-positive sympathetic cells in vivo are not actively proliferating between E6–E8.<br><br>Conclusion
Developing paravertebral sympathetic ganglia in avian and <span class="yellow">murine</span> embryos contain a subpopulation of sympathoblasts that transiently express TrkB and ultimately commence neuronal differentiation. These TrkB expressing sympathoblasts are not actively dividing in vivo; yet, when placed in vitro, will divide in response to BDNF. This suggests that the availability of BDNF in vivo fails to reach a threshold necessary to induce proliferation. We suggest that excess TrkB stimulation of sympathoblasts in vivo may lead to the genesis of neuroblastoma.<br><br><br><br>Background
Neural crest cells destined to become paravertebral sympathetic neurons proliferate and differentiate during migration and gangliogenesis. In <span class="yellow">chicken</span> embryos, migrating neural crest cells express catecholamines at Hamburger/Hamilton Stage (St.) 19, and these cells form the primary sympathetic chain dorsolateral to the aorta at St. 22 (E3.5) [1]. Between St. 23 (E4) and St. 28 (E6), these cells disperse and undergo a secondary migration to form the paravertebral sympathetic chain that resides ventral to the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion [1]. After ganglia coalesce, sympathoblasts express markers of neuronal differentiation, such as Q211 and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), at a time when they also incorporate [3H]-thymidine [2]. Time lapse photography has shown that cultured E15.5–E16.5 sympathetic neurons from <span class="yellow">rat</span> embryos extend axons while they divide [3-5]. Although proliferation appears to be an important process to expand the sympathetic neuron population during differentiation, the mechanisms that guide sympathoblast proliferation have not been identified.
The development of sympathetic neurons is guided by neurotrophins. Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) binds to its receptor, TrkC, to promote the survival of cultured sympathoblasts from early lumbar paravertebral ganglia [6]. Nerve growth factor (NGF) signals through its receptor, TrkA, to promote the survival of sympathetic neurons upon target innervation [7]. There are severe sympathetic defects in the superior cervical ganglion of individual NT-3 and NGF knockout <span class="blue">mice</span> [8-10]. Furthermore, there is no additional cell death in the superior cervical ganglion of NT-3 and NGF double knockout <span class="yellow">mouse</span> embryos, suggesting that all of the neurons are dependent on both neurotrophins for survival [11]. There is also an increase in sympathetic neuron cell death in TrkA knockout <span class="blue">mice</span> [12]. However, in TrkB and BDNF knockout <span class="blue">mice</span>, there is no apparent phenotype in the superior cervical ganglion, and there is little evidence that TrkB or BDNF is expressed in sympathetic ganglia. Thus, it is generally thought that TrkB and BDNF have little or no roles in guiding the development of sympathetic neurons.
In addition to their developmental functions, neurotrophin receptors regulate cell behavior in neuroblastoma, a tumor found in sympathetic ganglia and adrenal medulla. Tumors that express TrkA often spontaneously regress, while those that express TrkB and its ligand, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), grow aggressively, are invasive, and fail to respond to chemotherapeutic agents [13]. The presence of TrkA in neuroblastoma tumors is consistent with its expression in developing sympathetic neurons, and suggests that regressive neuroblastoma tumors arise from early sympathetic neurons that express TrkA. The function of TrkB in early sympathetic development is unknown, which makes understanding the etiology of aggressive neuroblastoma tumors difficult. Based on its function in neuroblastoma tumors, we hypothesize that BDNF and TrkB expression in differentiating sympathoblasts is responsible for expanding the neuronal population through proliferation.
We sought to determine whether BDNF and TrkB are involved in sympathetic development. We report that during early embryonic development, TrkB is expressed in a subset of differentiating sympathoblasts in both avian and <span class="yellow">murine</span> embryos. We also find that BDNF promotes the proliferation of TrkB-positive sympathoblasts in cell culture. However, the majority of TrkB positive cells in vivo fail to take up bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) over a 24 hr period, suggesting that endogenous BDNF concentrations do not reach a threshold necessary to stimulate proliferation of sympathoblasts. Shortly after all of the TrkB positive cells commence neuronal differentiation, TrkB immunoreactivity is lost. These results suggest that prolonged expression and/or activation of TrkB signaling at these early stages may be an early event triggering the formation of neuroblastoma.<br><br>Results
TrkB is expressed during migration of neural crest cells to sympathetic ganglia
We first determined whether TrkB is expressed in neural crest-derived cells in the region ventral to the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia where sympathetic ganglia coalesce between Hamburger/Hamilton Stages (St.) 25–28/29. To identify cells that have commenced neuronal differentiation, transverse sections of the lumbar spinal column region were stained with antibodies against Hu C/D [14], a neuronal-specific RNA-binding protein, or Islet-1, a transcription factor found in sympathetic neurons [15]. We found that Hu C/D and Islet-1 are expressed in the same cells both in vivo and in vitro throughout sympathetic development. In experiments done between St. 25 and 28, Islet-1 staining appeared weaker than Hu C/D staining, and thus we used Hu C/D to identify differentiating neurons at these stages. At later stages, Islet-1 was used to facilitate the identification of neurons because of the nuclear location of its immunoreactivity.
Cells expressing Hu C/D are first detected at St. 25 ventral to the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion and lateral to the dorsal aorta (Figure 1A, 1B). By St. 26, the number of cells that express Hu C/D in this region increases dramatically (Figure 1C). TrkB-expressing cells first appear at St. 27 in the same region and are adjacent to Hu C/D-positive cells (Figure 1D, 2A, 2H). TrkB-positive cells co-localize with a neural crest marker, HNK-1 (Figures 2B, 2C, 2D). The Hu C/D-positive cells in this region are likely to be sympathetic neurons, since they appear in the region where sympathetic ganglia form and express tyrosine hydroxylase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of catecholamines (Figures 2E, 2F, 2G). At St. 28/29, the cells begin to coalesce ventral to the dorsal root ganglion and the Hu C/D-positive cells and TrkB-positive cells remain as two separate cell populations (Figure 1E); however, shortly afterwards, all of the TrkB-positive cells begin to express Islet-1 (Figure 3B) and Hu C/D (data not shown).<br><br>Developmental regulation of TrkA, TrkB, TrkC, and BDNF expression
In contrast to TrkB, the other neurotrophin receptors, TrkA and TrkC, are co-expressed in both Hu C/D-positive and Hu C/D-negative cells at St. 27 (Figures 2I, 2J). We find that approximately 30% of the Islet-1-positive cells express TrkA (Figure 3A), while 50% express TrkB (Figure 3B) and 100% express TrkC (Figure 3C) at St. 29/30 (E6.5). Thus, all developing neurons express TrkC in combination with either TrkA or TrkB. By St. 31 (E7), the number of TrkA-positive, Islet-1-positive cells increases to 100% (Figure 3D) and immunoreactivities for both TrkB and TrkC appear dispersed (Figure 3E, 3F). By St. 34 (E8), TrkA expression is well-sustained (Figure 3G) and TrkB and TrkC immunoreactivities are lost (Figure 3H, 3I). We also examined the early development of <span class="yellow">murine</span> sympathetic ganglia (Figure 4). At E13, the newly formed lumbar sympathetic ganglia can be observed ventral to the spinal cord and notochord by their staining for Hu C/D and TH (Figure 4A). TrkB-positive cells can be seen surrounding developing ganglia, as well as in occasional cells within the ganglia (Figure 4C, D). These TrkB-positive cells within the ganglia co-express TH and are seen at a frequency of 1–2 cells per section starting at E13 (Figure 4A–D) and are still present at E15.5 (data not shown).
In neuroblastoma cells, BDNF is co-expressed with TrkB, suggesting that autocrine stimulation is a means by which proliferation is sustained in the transformed cells. To test whether BDNF, the ligand for TrkB, was present in embryonic <span class="yellow">chick</span> sympathetic ganglia, we used quantitative real-time PCR with TaqMan probes to determine the relative abundance of BDNF transcripts in total RNA extracted from lumbar sympathetic ganglia at St. 29/30 (E6.5), St. 31 (E7), St. 34 (E8), and E9. BDNF expression within the ganglia parallels that of TrkB: BDNF mRNA expression levels are highest at St 29/30 (E6.5), and these levels decrease 2-fold at St. 31 (E7) and St. 34 (E8; Figure 5). By E9, BDNF levels are 7 times lower than at St. 29/30 (E6.5; Figure 5).<br><br>NT3 and NGF promote survival of differentiating sympathetic neurons in culture
To determine the effect of neurotrophins, we cultured cells dispersed from lumbar sympathetic ganglia at St. 29/30 (E6.5) because, at this stage, ganglion formation is complete, the number of TrkA-, TrkB-, and TrkC-positive cells have peaked, and all Trk-expressing cells have initiated neural differentiation. First, we identified markers expressed by acutely isolated cells. As shown in Table 1, 80–91% of the cells are p75 neurotrophin receptor (NTR)-positive, indicating that most of the cells are neural crest-derived and little mesenchymal contamination is introduced by the isolation procedure. In addition, 28–33% of the cultured cells express the neural marker Hu C/D. Approximately half of these Hu C/D-positive cells express TrkB. Conversely, all of the TrkB positive cells express Hu C/D. These TrkB-positive cells comprise approximately 14–17% of the total cell population.
We then determined how many of the acutely isolated cells were proliferating by incubating them for 12 hrs in BrdU-containing medium. For these experiments, we identified differentiating neurons with the transcription factor Islet-1 because this marker labels nuclei, thus it co localizes with any BrdU that has been incorporated into the DNA, allowing us to determine whether the cell had undergone S-phase of the cell cycle. After 12 hrs in BrdU, 59% of Islet-1-positive nuclei stain for BrdU immunoreactivity. Thus, cultures of St. 29/30 sympathetic ganglia contain many cells that proliferate while exhibiting markers of neuronal differentiation, confirming previous observations [2]. We call these dividing neuronal precursors sympathoblasts. The remaining non-BrdU incorporating, Islet-1 positive cells are likely to be post mitotic neurons.
Finally, we determined the trophic requirements of St. 29/30 (E6.5) sympathetic neurons and sympathoblasts. We monitored cultures over a three day period after plating and counted the number of phase bright cells with neurites, a morphological feature of both neurons and sympathoblasts. In the absence of trophic factors, more than 2/3 of the cells die by 24 hours in culture and BDNF, NT-3, or NGF alone is not sufficient to promote survival (Figure 6). However, NGF together with NT-3 supports the survival of a significantly larger number of cells (Figure 6). For the subsequent experiments, all neurons were cultured with 25 ng/ml NT-3 and 1 μg/ml 7S NGF to optimize survival.<br><br>BDNF promotes proliferation of TrkB-positive sympathetic neurons in culture
To determine the effects of BDNF, cultures of cells from St. 29/30 (E6.5) sympathetic ganglia were supplemented with 200 ng/ml BDNF and the number of neurons and sympathoblasts were counted at 24, 48, and 72 hours using phase microscopy (Figure 7A). A 1.6-fold increase in the number of neurons due to BDNF is observed by 24 hours and this number does not increase further at 48 or 72 hours. This effect of BDNF is concentration-dependent with an EC50 of 75 ng/ml (Figure 7B).
To test whether the increase in the number of neurons and sympathoblasts caused by BDNF is due to the differentiation of pluripotent neural crest cells, we quantified the effects of BDNF on the number of neurally differentiating cells (Hu C/D-positive) versus the number of non-neuronal cells (Hu C/D-negative) after identifying all neural crest-derived cells by staining for p75NTR in St. 29/30 (E6.5) cultures. If BDNF increases the number of neurons and sympathoblasts by inducing a non-neuronal cell to express Hu C/D, then we expected that the total cell number would remain the same and that there would be a decrease in the number of non-neuronal cells as well as a corresponding increase in the number of neurons. After 24 hours, BDNF significantly increases the number of p75NTR-positive cells as well as the number of Hu C/D-positive cells (Figure 8A). However, there was no statistically significant change in the number of non-neuronal cells. Thus, it is unlikely that BDNF increases the number of neurons and sympathoblasts by inducing differentiation of non-neuronal cells.
To determine whether the increase in the total number of neurons and sympathoblasts is caused by BDNF-induced proliferation, control and BDNF-treated sympathetic cultures were exposed to BrdU for 12 hours after plating, and the number of cells that incorporated BrdU into their DNA was determined after 24 hours in culture. Even in the control condition, a number of cells in the culture are dividing, giving a high baseline of BrdU incorporation (Figure 8B). When BDNF is added, the total number of BrdU positive cells increases approximately 1.6-fold (Figure 8B). This BDNF-induced increase in the total number of BrdU positive cells occurs in sympathoblasts because the number of Islet-1-positive nuclei from control cultures that label with BrdU is 268 ± 59 and BDNF treatment raises this number to 424 ± 80, which corresponds to an increase of 1.6-fold. This accounts for the 1.6-fold increase in total neuron number and total BrdU-positive cells described above. We then confirmed that BDNF acts on TrkB-positive cells: BDNF increases the number of TrkB-expressing cells that incorporate BrdU 2.6 – 4-fold over control (Table 2) and it also increases the overall number of TrkB-positive cells 2 – 2.5-fold over control (Table 2). BDNF does not increase the number of BrdU-positive, TrkB-negative cells or the overall number of TrkB-negative cells (Table 2). In further support that BDNF acts directly on TrkB-expressing cells, an antibody directed against the extracellular domain of TrkB completely prevents the effect of BDNF in promoting proliferation of TrkB-positive, but not TrkB-negative cells (compare Figure 9A to 9B). Thus, the effect of BDNF is restricted to the population that expresses TrkB, which are developing sympathoblasts.
To determine whether TrkB-positive cells are actively proliferating in vivo, embryos were injected with BrdU at St. 27 and harvested at St. 29, approximately 24 hrs later. The majority (85–90%) of TrkB-positive cells do not incorporate BrdU into their nuclei under basal conditions in vivo (Figure 10), although a few TrkB positive cells with labeled nuclei could be observed (arrows). This contrasts with our observation that 71–76% of TrkB-positive cells incorporate BrdU in culture after treatment with BDNF (Table 2), suggesting that endogenous BDNF does not achieve a threshold sufficient to support a high level of sympathoblast proliferation in vivo.<br><br>
Discussion
We report that the neurotrophin receptor TrkB is expressed in a subset of embryonic sympathoblasts during the early development of lumbar paravertebral sympathetic ganglia in <span class="yellow">chicken</span> and <span class="yellow">mouse</span> embryos. In the <span class="yellow">chicken</span>, TrkB expression is transient, and completely lost by St 34 (E8). Since BDNF induces the proliferation of sympathoblasts in cell culture, yet in vivo there is little proliferation observed in TrkB-positive cells in nascent ganglia, we propose that if TrkB activation becomes unregulated by excess BDNF or constitutive phosphorylation of TrkB [16], this transient population of TrkB-positive sympathoblasts may trigger the genesis of neuroblastoma, a childhood tumor found in the paravertebral chain and adrenal medulla.
The two populations of sympathoblasts that we observe support previous findings of heterogeneity among developing sympathetic neurons and neural crest cells. Early sympathetic ganglia contain at least two subpopulations: early differentiating neurons that lack TrkB expression and express TrkA and TrkC, and late differentiating sympathoblasts that express TrkB. Explant cultures of sympathetic ganglia from E16 <span class="yellow">chick</span> embryos give rise to two neuronal populations: one that remains close to the explant, and one that migrates away from the explant [1]. In addition, early neuronal subpopulations have been observed in cultures of neural crest cells from St. 13/14 quail embryos as evidenced by the expression of neuronal cell type-specific gangliosides [17]. Perhaps these different subpopulations will ultimately give rise to the two neurochemically distinct populations found in lumbar sympathetic ganglia: the noradrenergic, NPY-containing neurons that innervate internal organs and enteric ganglia and the cholinergic, VIP-containing neurons that innervate vasculature in the hind limbs.
The effects of BDNF and TrkB deletion and over expression have been studied on superior cervical ganglion and preganglionic neurons in thoracic segments of the spinal column, but not on paravertebral sympathetic neurons. In the superior cervical ganglion, an increase in the number of neurons of BDNF null <span class="blue">mice</span> is likely due to apoptosis induced by BDNF via p75NTR [18]. In contrast, the responses of paravertebral sympathetic neurons to BDNF are complex and subtype dependent. Over expression of BDNF leads to an increase in the number of noradrenergic fibers innervating the erector pilli muscles of hair follicles, while noradrenergic fibers innervating blood vessels were unaffected [19]. If our results indicating that BDNF promotes proliferation of TrkB-positive sympathoblasts in the <span class="yellow">chicken</span> embryo can be extrapolated to the subset of TrkB-positive sympathoblasts in <span class="yellow">murine</span> ganglia, then these TrkB-positive cells may be neurons destined to innervate the erector pilli. In other studies, TrkB null <span class="blue">mice</span> showed no changes in morphology or cell number in superior cervical ganglia [12] or in the intermediolateral column [20]; but this may not be predictive of a phenotype in the lumbar paravertebral chain. It is thus possible that BDNF/TrkB signaling could play a specific role in other regions of the paravertebral sympathetic chain, such as the lumbar region. However, if TrkB-positive cells are not normally actively proliferating in vivo, then it would not be surprising that the development of the paravertebral sympathetic chain is not disrupted in TrkB or BDNF null <span class="blue">mice</span>. It may be more informative to examine <span class="blue">mice</span> that over express BDNF on a promoter that targets expression to embryonic lumbar ganglia. Unfortunately, such <span class="blue">mice</span> do not exist.
Our findings that the St. 29/30 (E6.5) sympathoblasts are dependent on both NT-3 and NGF for survival in culture are consistent with previous work on <span class="yellow">mouse</span> sympathoblasts from the superior cervical ganglion [11]. In these studies, NT-3 and NGF deletion separately led to a decrease in the number of sympathetic neurons at E17.5 compared to control. Deletion of both NT-3 and NGF together did not enhance cell death. In contrast, cultured <span class="yellow">rat</span> superior cervical ganglion sympathetic neurons respond to NT-3 at E14.5 and then to NGF at E19.5, although time points in between were not analyzed [6].
In addition to promoting survival, NT-3, NGF, and BDNF also induce proliferation of various neuronal precursors at different stages of development. NT-3 can promote the incorporation of [3H]-thymidine into cultured quail neural crest cells from the trunk region [21,22], Later in <span class="yellow">rat</span> sympathetic development, NT-3 supports survival of neurons, but does not promote proliferation [6], which is consistent with our results. NGF promotes an increase in BrdU incorporation from 25% to 35% in the DRG cervical segment 2 in the <span class="yellow">chick</span> embryo [23]. In <span class="yellow">chicken</span> embryos that are treated with NGF in ovo at St. 18 and 21, there is an increase in BrdU uptake after formation of the primary sympathetic chain at St. 23 [24]. Since NGF does not appear to affect proliferation of St. 29/30 (E6.5) <span class="yellow">chick</span> sympathoblasts, NGF may only promote proliferation in primary, but not secondary chain sympathoblasts. Motor neuron progenitors in the ventral neural tube from the <span class="yellow">chick</span> embryo express TrkB and when ventral neural tube explants are treated with BDNF, there is an increase in the number of motor neurons produced and BrdU incorporation [25]. BDNF also promotes the proliferation of cultured neuroblastoma cells [13]. Taken together, these results are consistent with our findings that NT-3 and NGF do not promote proliferation of St. 29/30 (E6.5) sympathoblasts, and support the assertion that BDNF promotes proliferation of TrkB-positive sympathoblasts in culture.
Our observations suggest a transient function of TrkB during early sympathetic development in supporting proliferation of this early subpopulation of sympathoblasts. However, the in vivo labeling suggests that only a minority (10–20%) of this population is dividing during the window that TrkB is expressed. In light of the very strong proliferative effect produced in cell culture, these TrkB expressing cells could respond more strongly if endogenous BDNF rises to higher levels, or if the mechanism that down regulates TrkB expression becomes nonfunctional. Such events could trigger an early proliferative event that leads to a cascade of changes that initiates transformation of cells to neuroblastoma. Thus, these early TrkB expressing cells help solve the puzzle as to why TrkB is expressed in aggressive and invasive forms of neuroblastoma, particularly because BDNF induces cultured neuroblastoma cells to become more proliferative, invasive, angiogenic, and resistant to chemotherapeutic reagents than untreated cultures [13]. Future studies will determine whether constitutive expression of BDNF and TrkB in the <span class="yellow">chick</span> embryo sustains proliferation of differentiating sympathoblasts.<br><br>Conclusion
We have identified a time point during development when differentiating lumbar sympathetic neurons transiently express TrkB and proliferate in response to high concentrations of BDNF in culture. These studies suggest that elevated BDNF expression above basal levels and signaling through TrkB may be a mechanism that contributes to the onset of neuroblastoma. A further understanding of the two populations of sympathetic neurons and the fate of the TrkB-positive cells will provide additional insight into the development of paravertebral sympathetic ganglia and the genesis of neuroblastoma.<br><br>Methods
Preparation of tissue for immunohistochemistry
The lumbar spinal column and surrounding tissues were dissected from <span class="yellow">chicken</span> embryos at the indicated stages and placed in Zamboni's fixative (4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, 15% (v/v) picric acid in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) for two hours at room temperature. <span class="yellow">Mouse</span> embryos at 13–15 days post-coitus were collected according to an IACUC-approved protocol to Dr. L. Sherman at the Oregon Health and Science University. The <span class="yellow">mouse</span> embryos were immersion-fixed in Zamboni's fixative overnight at 4 degrees C then washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 130 mM NaCl, 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). Fixed tissues were equilibrated in 30% sucrose in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Fixed <span class="yellow">mouse</span> embryos were shipped to Vermont in sucrose. Transverse 30 μM sections of the spinal columns were cut at on a Microm HM cryostat (knife temperature: 16°C; object temperature: 23°C) and collected on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher). Sections were dried at room temperature, washed in 1× PBS and incubated overnight in blocking buffer (1× PBS consisting of 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated <span class="yellow">horse</span> serum (Invitrogen/Gibco), 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma), and 0.1% sodium azide (Fisher)).<br><br>Immunohistochemistry
Sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies for 2 hours at room temperature. Primary antibodies used were: <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-p75 (1:1500, generous gift from Louis Reichardt, UCSF [26]), <span class="yellow">mouse</span> IgG2b anti-Hu C/D, (1:250, Molecular Probes); <span class="yellow">mouse</span> IgG1 anti-Islet-1, (1:10, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank); <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-<span class="yellow">chicken</span> TrkA (1:500); <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-<span class="yellow">chicken</span> TrkB (1:500); <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-<span class="yellow">chicken</span> TrkC (1:500) (all Trk antibodies were generous gifts of Dr. Louis Reichardt, UCSF [26-28]); <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-HNK-1 (1:50, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank); <span class="yellow">mouse</span> IgG2a anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (1:10, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), <span class="yellow">sheep</span> anti-BrdU (1:100, Biodesign International), <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (1:100, Chemicon), and <span class="yellow">goat</span> anti-TrkB (1:1000, R&D Systems). Immunofluorescence was imaged using a Nikon C1 confocal mounted on a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope with a 10× Plan Apo (NA 0.785) air objective or a 60× Plan Apo (NA 1.4) oil objective lens, E7-C1 software, and UV, Argon, and He/Ne lasers exciting at 408, 488, and 543 nm and emitting at 404 500–530, and 555–615 nm, respectively. A Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope in the nearby COBRE Molecular/Cellular Core Facility was used for counting immunofluorescent cells at 200× using epifluorescence optics.<br><br>RNA Extraction/cDNA synthesis
Sympathetic ganglia were removed from <span class="yellow">chick</span> embryos and RNA was isolated using TriReagent (Molecular Research Center), an acidified guanidinium with phenol extraction method [29]. RNA was transcribed to cDNA using oligo-dT with Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42°C for 1 hour.<br><br>Real-time PCR
Relative RNA levels were determined using quantitative real-time PCR with an ABI 7500 Fast Real Time PCR System. TaqMan probes were used to quantify the progression of the PCR reaction and reactions were normalized using the constitutively expressed gene <span class="yellow">chick</span> ribosomal binding protein s17 (CHRPS). The sequences were used for primer/probes sets: for BDNF: forward: 5'-AGCCCAGTGAGGAAAACAAG-3', reverse: 5'-ACTCCTCGAGCAGAAAGAGC-3', probe: 5'-[6-FAM]-TACACATCCCGAGTCATGCTGAGCA-[BHQ]-3'; for CHRPS (<span class="yellow">chick</span> ribosomal binding protein S-17): 5'AACGACTTCCACACCAACAA3', reverse: 5'CTTCATCAGGTGGGTGACAT3', probe: 5'-[6-FAM]-CGCCATCATCCCCAGCAAGA [BHQ]-3'. Primers and probes were synthesized by Operon Technologies, Inc (Alameda, CA). The primers for BDNF were validated against primers for CHRPS according to an Applied BioSystems protocol by serially diluting the target cDNA 1:10, determining the cycle threshold (Ct) for each reaction, and plotting the Ct versus log concentration. Slopes of the resulting lines were calculated and primers were accepted if their Ct slopes were between -3.2 and -3.4 (a perfect efficiency of 1.0 yields a slope of -3.3). To analyze the data, the delta Ct method of relative quantification was used, where the Ct of Chrps was subtracted from the Ct of the gene of interest (Delta Ct) and the arbitrary units of mRNA were expressed as 10000/2^(Delta Ct).<br><br>Cell culture
Sympathetic neurons were cultured as previously described [30] with a few modifications. Sympathetic ganglia were removed from the lumbar region of the paravertebral chain of St. 29/30 (E6.5) <span class="yellow">chick</span> embryos and placed in Modified Puck's solution with glucose (MPG). The cells were dissociated by incubation of sympathetic ganglia with 0.1% trypsin in MPG at 37°C for 10 minutes followed by triturating with a fire polished 9" Pasteur pipette. Cells were then resuspended in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) consisting of 10% <span class="yellow">horse</span> serum, 2% fetal <span class="yellow">calf</span> serum, and 10 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. For neurotrophin studies, the culture medium was supplemented with 25 ng/ml NT-3 (R & D Systems) and 1 μg/ml 7S NGF (Alomone Labs) upon plating, and 50 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml, or 200 ng/ml BDNF (R & D Systems) once the cells adhered to the wells. Cells were plated on poly-D-lysine/laminin coated wells or cover slips (Fisher) as previously described [30].<br><br>Quantification of neurons and sympathoblasts using phase microscopy
Embryonic sympathoblasts and neurons are small, phase bright cells with neurites. The total number of cells with neurites the length of two cell bodies were counted in 10 non-overlapping fields of view evenly spaced in a grid-like pattern across the bottom of a well from a 24 well plate at 200× using a Nikon Eclipse TE200 microscope.<br><br>BrdU labeling
For in vitro studies, approximately 2 hours after plating cells from St. 29/30 (E6.5) sympathetic ganglia, cells were labeled with 10 μM bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, Sigma) for 12 hours at 37°C. Following this labeling period, cells were incubated in complete medium without BrdU for an additional 10 hrs. Cells were then fixed in Zamboni's fixative for 30 min at room temperature and rinsed with 1× PBS. For in vivo studies, 25 μg BrdU was injected into the amnion of <span class="yellow">chick</span> embryos at St. 27. The cells and sections were denatured with 2 N HCl at 37°C for 1 hr, and were then neutralized with 0.1 M borate buffer, pH 8.5, for 10 min at room temperature. Immunochemistry was performed as described above.<br><br>

<h3>pmcA2412862</h3>Minocycline attenuates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation, sickness behavior, and anhedonia
Abstract
Background
Activation of the peripheral innate immune system stimulates the secretion of CNS cytokines that modulate the behavioral symptoms of sickness. Excessive production of cytokines by microglia, however, may cause long-lasting behavioral and cognitive complications. The purpose of this study was to determine if minocycline, an anti-inflammatory agent and purported microglial inhibitor, attenuates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation, sickness behavior, and anhedonia.<br><br>Methods
In the first set of experiments the effect of minocycline pretreatment on LPS-induced microglia activation was assessed in BV-2 microglia cell cultures. In the second study, adult (3–6 m) BALB/c <span class="blue">mice</span> received an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of vehicle or minocycline (50 mg/kg) for three consecutive days. On the third day, <span class="blue">mice</span> were also injected (i.p.) with saline or <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span> LPS (0.33 mg/kg) and behavior (i.e., sickness and anhedonia) and markers of neuroinflammation (i.e., microglia activation and inflammatory cytokines) were determined. In the final study, adult and aged BALB/c <span class="blue">mice</span> were treated with the same minocycline and LPS injection regimen and markers of neuroinflammation were determined. All data were analyzed using Statistical Analysis Systems General Linear Model procedures and were subjected to one-, two-, or three-way ANOVA to determine significant main effects and interactions.<br><br>Results
Minocycline blocked LPS-stimulated inflammatory cytokine secretion in the BV-2 microglia-derived cell line and reduced LPS-induced Toll-like-receptor-2 (TLR2) surface expression on brain microglia. Moreover, minocycline facilitated the recovery from sickness behavior (i.e., anorexia, weight loss, and social withdrawal) and prevented anhedonia in adult <span class="blue">mice</span> challenged with LPS. Furthermore, the minocycline associated recovery from LPS-induced sickness behavior was paralleled by reduced mRNA levels of Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase (IDO) in the cortex and hippocampus. Finally, in aged <span class="blue">mice</span>, where exaggerated neuroinflammation was elicited by LPS, minocycline pretreatment was still effective in markedly reducing mRNA levels of IL-1β, TLR2 and IDO in the hippocampus.<br><br>Conclusion
These data indicate that minocycline mitigates neuroinflammation in the adult and aged brain and modulates the cytokine-associated changes in motivation and behavior.<br><br><br><br>Background
The bi-directional communication between the immune system and the central nervous system (CNS) is necessary for mounting the appropriate immunological, physiological, and behavioral responses to immune stimulation [1]. CNS innate immune cells including microglia and macrophages play integral roles in receiving and propagating inflammatory signals that are initiated at the periphery. Activation of peripheral innate immune cells elicits the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα.), that use neural [2,3], humoral [4] and blood brain barrier pathways [5] to relay this signal to the CNS. This inflammatory signal, in turn, induces CNS macrophages and microglia to produce the same cytokines [6], which target neuronal substrates and elicit a sickness behavior syndrome that is normally adaptive and beneficial to the host [1]. An amplified or excessive inflammatory cytokine response in the brain, however, is associated with a myriad of complications including cognitive dysfunction [7-10], prolonged sickness behavior [11-14], and depressive-like behavior [15].
Microglia are primarily involved in immune surveillance [16,17], but when activated have macrophage-like capabilities including phagocytosis, inflammatory cytokine production, and antigen presentation [18]. Normally these neuroinflammatory changes are transient with microglia returning to a resting state as the immune stimulus is resolved. Aging or neurological disease, however, may provide a brain environment where microglia are more "reactive or primed" to a peripheral immune challenge [19]. Recent findings indicate that several markers of glial activation such as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, complement receptors, and scavenger receptors are increased in brain during normal aging [13,20-26]. Furthermore, we and others have reported that a biological consequence of this reactive glial profile is an exaggerated neuroinflammatory response to innate immune challenge [9,10,12-14,27,28].
Active microglia and CNS macrophages also contribute to the production of oxidative and neuroactive mediators that may influence behavior. For instance, inflammatory cytokines in the CNS upregulate the enzyme IDO [29,30], which metabolizes tryptophan (TRP) into L-kynurenine (KYN) [31]. TRP degradation to KYN can reduce TRP levels that are required for serotonin synthesis [32] and can lead to the production of neuroactive mediators including 3-hydroxykynurenine (3HK) and quinolinic acid (QUIN) [31]. High levels of 3HK and QUIN induce neuronal damage through oxidative stress [33] and over stimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors [34,35]. A recent study indicates that while several cell types in the CNS express IDO, only microglia maintain all the enzymes required to produce 3HK and QUIN [36]. Because IDO mediated TRP degradation impacts both serotonergic and glutamatergic pathways, this may be an important mechanism underlying mood and behavior complications concomitant with inflammation [37-39].
Because activated microglia are suspected to cause or exacerbate several neurodegenerative diseases, pharmacological strategies to suppress microglial activity are being explored as therapies. Minocycline is a tetracycline derived antibiotic that has anti-inflammatory properties in the CNS that are separate from its antimicrobial action [40]. Minocycline readily crosses the blood brain barrier and attenuates inflammation associated with microglial activation. For example, minocycline blocks the deleterious effects of neuroinflammation on neurogenesis, long-term potentiation, and neuronal survival [41-43]. The mechanism of action is unclear, but recent studies indicate that minocycline abrogates MAPkinase and NFκB dependent signaling pathways in primary microglia and microglia cell cultures [44]. Moreover, in the brain of <span class="yellow">rats</span>, minocycline abrogates microglial expression of CD11b and MHC II through a protein kinase-c dependent mechanism [45]. This is relevant because minocycline attenuates neuroinflammation in several <span class="yellow">rodent</span> models of disease including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis [46], Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) [45] and MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease [47]. However, the extent to which minocycline facilitates the recovery from cytokine-mediated sickness behavior is unknown.
The present study investigated the degree to which minocycline–an anti-inflammatory agent and purported microglial inhibitor–reduced LPS-induced neuroinflammation and sickness behavior. We show that minocycline blocked LPS-stimulated inflammatory cytokine secretion in the BV-2 microglia-derived cell line and reduced LPS-induced Toll-like-receptor-2 (TLR2) surface expression on brain microglia. Moreover, our data show that minocycline pretreatment attenuated LPS-induced weight loss, social withdrawal, and anhedonia in adult <span class="blue">mice</span>. The attenuation of sickness behavior was paralleled with minocycline dependent decrease in markers of neuroinflammation (IL-1β, TLR2, and IDO) in adult and aged <span class="blue">mice</span>. These findings support our hypothesis that the ability to mitigate cytokine expression in the brain during systemic inflammatory events may be useful in preventing cognitive and behavioral deficits.<br><br>Methods
Animals
Male BALB/c <span class="blue">mice</span>, adults (3 month old) and juvenile (3–4 week old) were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). For age comparisons, male BALB/c <span class="blue">mice</span> (3–4 and 20–22 month old) were purchased from the National Institute on Aging specific pathogen free colony. Upon arrival, <span class="blue">mice</span> were individually housed in polypropylene cages and maintained at 21°C under a 12 h light: 12 h dark cycle with ad libitum access to water and <span class="yellow">rodent</span> chow. At the end of each study, <span class="blue">mice</span> were examined postmortem for gross signs of disease (e.g., splenomeglia or tumors). Data from <span class="blue">mice</span> determined to be unhealthy were excluded from analysis (< 5%). All procedures were in accordance with the National Institute of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by The Ohio State University Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee.<br><br>Cell culture
BV-2 microglia cell lines were cultured in growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, sodium bicarbonate 3.7 g/l, 200 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml fungizone) as previously described [12]. Cultures were maintained at 37°C with 95% humidity and 5% CO2 and growth medium was replenished every third day until confluence. Cultures were washed twice and supplemented with warm growth medium containing experimental treatments. Cell viability was measured by the MTS cell proliferation assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI).<br><br>CNS macrophage/microglia isolation
CNS macrophages and microglia were collected from whole brain homogenates as described previously [48], but with several modifications. <span class="yellow">Mice</span> were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation and whole brains were collected. Brains were homogenized in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) pH 7.4. Brain homogenates were passed through a 70 μm nylon cell strainer and centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were removed and cell pellets were re-suspended in 70% isotonic Percoll (GE-healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) at room temperature. A discontinuous Percoll density gradient was set up as follows: 70%, 35%, and 0% isotonic Percoll. This suspension was centrifuged for 30 minutes at 400 × g. A mixed population of CNS macrophages and microglia was collected from the interphase between the 70% and 35% Percoll layers. Cells were washed and then re-suspended in sterile HBSS. The number of viable cells was determined using a hemacytometer and 0.2% trypan blue staining.<br><br>Flow cytometry
Flow cytometric analysis of microglial cell surface markers was performed as described previously, but with a few modifications [48]. In brief, Fc receptors on macrophages and microglia were blocked with anti-CD16/CD32 antibody (eBiosciences, CA). Next, cells were incubated with either Panel-1 (anti-CD11b APC, anti-CD45 FITC, and anti-MHC II PE from eBiosciences, CA) or Panel-2 antibodies (anti-CD11b APC, anti-CD45 FITC, and anti-TLR2 PE from eBiosciences, CA). Expression of these surface receptors was determined by flow cytometry using a Becton-Dickinson FACSCaliber four color Cytometer. Thirty thousand events were collected and microglia were differentiated from macrophages based on the levels of CD11b and CD45 surface expression. Microglia stain CD11b+/CD45low and macrophages stain CD11b+/CD45high [48,49]. Flow data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, San Carlos, CA).<br><br>Behavior tests
Social exploratory behavior
To assess the motivation to engage in social exploratory behavior, a novel juvenile conspecific was introduced into the test subject's home cage for a 10-min period. Behavior was video taped and the cumulative amount of time the subject engaged in social investigation was determined from the video records by a trained observer who was blind to the experimental treatments. Baseline social behavior was measured at time 0 for all experimental treatments. Social behavior was determined as the amount of time that the experimental subject spent investigating (e.g., anogenital sniffing, trailing) the juvenile. Results are expressed as percent decrease in time engaged in social behavior compared to respective baseline measures.<br><br>Sucrose preference
To assess sucrose preference, <span class="blue">mice</span> were provided two solutions, water or water supplemented with 2% sucrose, in 50 ml conical tubes with stoppers fitted with ball-type sipper tubes. Prior to testing conditions, all <span class="blue">mice</span> were acclimated to the two bottle test choice. All <span class="blue">mice</span> drank both the water and the 2% sucrose solution, but preferred drinking the sucrose over the water (data not shown). On the day of testing, <span class="blue">mice</span> were fluid and food deprived for 2 h prior to testing [50]. At the start of the dark phase of the photoperiod, drinking water and the 2% sucrose solution were placed in the home cage overnight (15 h). At the end of each testing period the fluid content of the conical tubes was measured and sucrose preference was determined using the equation: Sucrose intake/Total fluid intake (water + sucrose intake) × 100 [51].<br><br>
Plasma cytokine measurement
IL-6 and IL-1β were measured in the plasma as previously described [52]. In brief, <span class="blue">mice</span> were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation and blood was collected by cardiac puncture into EDTA coated syringes. Samples were centrifuged (6000 × g for 15 min at 4°C) and plasma was collected and stored frozen (-80°C) until assaying. Plasma samples were assayed for IL-6 using a customized ELISA that we have described in detail [52] and for IL-1β using a commercial ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Assays were sensitive to 8 pg/ml of IL-6 and 1.5 pg/ml of IL-1β, and inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation were less than 10%.<br><br>Real time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from brain using the Tri Reagent protocol (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). RNA samples were subjected to a DNase I digestion procedure and then reverse transcribed to cDNA using a RT RETROscript kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Quantitative real time PCR was performed using the Applied Biosystems (Foster, CA) Assay-on Demand Gene Expression protocol as previously described [13]. In brief, cDNA was amplified by real time PCR where a target cDNA (IL-1β, IL-6, MHC II, TLR2, or IDO) and a reference cDNA (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) were amplified simultaneously using an oligonucleotide probe with a 5' fluorescent reporter dye (6-FAM) and a 3' quencher dye (NFQ). Fluorescence was determined on an ABI PRISM 7300-sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, CA). Data were analyzed using the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method and results are expressed as fold difference.<br><br>Experimental protocols
For the cell culture studies, minocycline was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and BV-2 cells were washed and replenished with growth mediumsupplemented with 0, 25, 50, 100, 200, or 400 μg/ml minocycline. After 30 min, LPS at 10 ng/ml was added to the culture medium. Supernatants were collected 4 h later and IL-6 and IL-1β concentrations were determined by ELISA. Total proteins were determined from cell culture homogenates by the Bio-Rad Dc protein assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad Lboratories, Hercules, CA). Each treatment was replicated a minimum of four times. Cell viability was confirmed by the MTS cell proliferation assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI).
For all <span class="yellow">mouse</span> studies, minocycline (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in sterile water and sonicated to ensure complete solubilization. In the first <span class="yellow">mouse</span> study, adult male BALB/c <span class="blue">mice</span> received an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of vehicle or minocycline (50 mg/kg) for three consecutive days. On the 3rd day, <span class="blue">mice</span> were also injected i.p. with saline or <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span> LPS (0.33 mg/kg; serotype 0127:B8, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation 24 h later (n = 6). The LPS dosage was selected because it elicits a proinflammatory cytokine response in the brain resulting in mild transient sickness behavior in adult <span class="blue">mice</span> [13,53]. Macrophage/microglial cells were isolated from whole brain homogenates and TLR2 and MHC II surface expression were determined by flow cytometry. The minocycline injection regimen and dosage was selected because a repeated pretreatment course with minocycline is necessary to attenuate neuroinflammation [41-43,45].
In the second study, adult male BALB/c <span class="blue">mice</span> received an i.p. injection with vehicle or minocycline for three consecutive days. On the third day, motivation to engage in social behavior was determined immediately before i.p. injection of saline or LPS (0.33 mg/kg) and again 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h later (n = 8). Body weight and food intake were measured at each time point over the 24 h period. In a related, but separate study, adult <span class="blue">mice</span> were treated with minocycline and LPS as described and anhedonia was assessed 24–39 h following i.p. injection of saline or LPS (0.33 mg/kg) (n = 15). Body weight, food intake, water intake, and sucrose intake were determined over the testing period.
In the third study, adult BALB/c <span class="blue">mice</span> were treated with minocycline and then LPS as described. <span class="yellow">Mice</span> were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation 4 later. Brains were removed and dissected to collect different brain regions. Brain regions were stored at -20°C in RNAlater (Qiagen, CA). Total RNA was isolated from brain samples and assayed using quantitative PCR (n = 8). Plasma was also collected and stored (-80°C) until assaying.
In a final study, adult (3–4 month old) or aged (20–22 month old) male BALB/c <span class="blue">mice</span> were treated with minocycline and LPS as described and euthanized 4 h later. Brains were dissected to collect different brain regions and were stored at -20°C in RNAlater (Qiagen, CA). Total RNA was isolated from the hippocampus and assayed using quantitative PCR (n = 8).<br><br>Statistical analysis
All data were analyzed using Statistical Analysis Systems (SAS) General Linear Model procedures. Data were subjected to one, two- (Mino × LPS, Age × LPS, Mino × Age) or three-way (Mino × LPS × Time, Mino × LPS × Age) ANOVA to determine significant main effects and interactions between main factors. When appropriate, differences between treatment means were evaluated by an F-protected t-test using the Least-Significant Difference procedure of SAS. All data are expressed as treatment means ± standard error of the mean (SEM).<br><br>
Results
Minocycline attenuates LPS-induced cytokine production in BV-2 microglia
Minocycline is a tetracycline-type antibiotic that has anti-inflammatory properties in the CNS [41-43,45]. To determine the degree to which minocycline suppresses microglia activation, BV-2 microglia-derived cell lines were used. In the first experiment, BV-2 cells were treated with LPS and IL-6 production was determined 4 h later. Fig. 1A shows that LPS increased IL-6 production in a dose dependent manner F(5, 23) = 101, P < 0.001). In the second experiment, BV-2 cells were incubated with DMSO or minocycline and then stimulated with LPS. Minocycline reduced LPS-induced IL-6 secretion in a dose dependent manner (Mino × LPS interaction, F(4, 23) = 16.87, P < 0.001, Fig. 1B). Minocycline pretreatment had a similar anti-inflammatory effect on LPS-stimulated IL-1β secretion (Fig. 1C). In a third experiment, minocycline suppressed LPS-induced MHC II, TLR2, IL-1β, and IL-6 mRNA levels (P < 0.05, for each, Fig. 1D). The MTS assay verified that neither cell survival nor proliferation was affected by the experimental treatments (data not shown).<br><br>LPS-induced TLR2 surface expression on microglia is reduced by minocycline
Because minocycline attenuated LPS-induced cytokine secretion and TLR2 mRNA expression in BV-2 cells we next sought to determine if minocycline suppresses markers of microglial activation in the brain of <span class="blue">mice</span>. <span class="yellow">Mice</span> were injected i.p. with vehicle or minocycline for 3 consecutive days then challenged with saline or LPS i.p. Markers of activation, TLR2 and MHC II, were determined on microglia collected 24 h later. The representative bivariate density plot in Fig. 2A shows that there were two populations of CD11b/CD45 positive cells and that more cells stained CD11b+/CD45low (microglia) than CD11b+/CD45high (CNS macrophages). ANOVA revealed that LPS injection increased TLR2 surface expression on microglia (F(1, 20) = 17.6, P < 0.004, Fig. 2B&D), but this induction was abrogated by minocycline pretreatment (Tendency for Mino × LPS interaction, F(1, 20) = 2.66, P = 0.10, Fig. 2C&D). It is important to note that because minocycline and saline controls did not differ in their TLR2 expression, these data were grouped together as the Control group (Fig. 2B&C). In addition, neither minocycline nor LPS treatment had a significant main effect on MHC class II surface expression on microglia (data not shown). These data indicate that minocycline attenuated LPS-induced TLR2 expression on microglia.<br><br>Minocycline facilitates the recovery from LPS-induced sickness behavior
CNS macrophages and microglia produce inflammatory cytokines and secondary messengers that modulate behavioral responses. Therefore, we next investigated if minocycline reduced the sickness response associated with peripheral LPS injection. In this experiment, adult <span class="blue">mice</span> were treated with minocycline and LPS as described. Social exploratory behavior was measured before i.p. LPS injection and again 2, 4, 8, and 24 h later. Fig. 3A shows that LPS injection caused a reduction in social exploratory behavior (F(1,57) = 218, P < 0.001) that was time dependent (F(4,57) = 66.5, P < 0.001). Moreover, the LPS-associated reduction in social exploration was attenuated by minocycline (Mino × LPS interaction, F(1,57) = 7.5, P < 0.007). For example, at 8 h post LPS, social exploration was reduced by 35% in minocycline pretreated <span class="blue">mice</span> given LPS compared to a 67% reduction in vehicle pretreated <span class="blue">mice</span> given LPS (P < 0.001). While minocycline administration alone reduced food intake and body weight in control <span class="blue">mice</span> (P < 0.05, for each), it also protected against LPS-associated anorexia (Mino × LPS interaction, F(1, 60) = 70.0, P < 0.001, Fig. 3B) and weight loss (Mino × LPS interaction, F(1, 60) = 29.7, P < 0.001, Fig. 3C).
Because sickness can also be associated with longer lasting changes in motivation [38], we next sought to determine if minocycline abrogated LPS-induced anhedonia [54,55]. In this experiment, <span class="blue">mice</span> were subjected to the same minocycline injection regimen and LPS challenge as above and sucrose preference was assessed 24–39 h post LPS injection. By 24 h post LPS injection, food and water intake returned to baseline and LPS treated <span class="blue">mice</span> still exhibited a marked reduction in sucrose preference from 24–39 h (F(1,59) = 14.3, P < 0.003). Moreover, this LPS-dependent reduction in sucrose preference was prevented by minocycline pretreatment (Mino × LPS interaction, F(1, 59) = 9.9, P < 0.004, Fig. 4). For example, minocycline pretreated <span class="blue">mice</span> injected with LPS maintained the same strong preference for sucrose as saline and minocycline controls (i.e., approximately 85% preference). These data can be interpreted to indicate that minocycline blocks anhedonia associated with peripheral LPS challenge.<br><br>Minocycline reduces LPS-induced neuroinflammation
Pro-inflammatory cytokines in the CNS are partially responsible for the behavioral symptoms of sickness (e.g., anorexia, social withdrawal, and anhedonia) [1]. Therefore, we investigated the degree to which minocycline reduces neuroinflammation (IL-1β, IL-6, and IDO) after peripheral injection of LPS. In this experiment, <span class="blue">mice</span> were subjected to the minocycline injection regimen and LPS challenge as above and cytokine mRNA levels were determined in the cortex and hippocampus 4 h after LPS injection. In <span class="blue">mice</span> pretreated with vehicle, LPS markedly increased IL-1β mRNA levels in the hippocampus (F(1,31) = 62, P < 0.0001) and cortex (F(1,31) = 17.25, P < 0.0003). The LPS-induced IL-1β mRNA expression was reduced in both brain regions in <span class="blue">mice</span> receiving minocycline prior to LPS injection: (hippocampus, F(1,31) = 9.63, P < 0.01) and cortex, F(1,31) = 7.23, P = 0.08, Fig. 5A). LPS caused a similar induction of IL-6 mRNA levels in the hippocampus (F(1,31) = 37.2, P < 0.001) and cortex (F(1,31) = 22.5, P < 0.001), but minocycline pretreatment only significantly attenuated LPS-induced IL-6 mRNA levels in the hippocampus (F(1,31) = 10.27, P < 0.004, Fig. 5B).
IDO mRNA levels were determined from the same RNA pool. Fig. 6D shows that LPS injection increased IDO mRNA expression in the hippocampus (F(1,31) = 11.69, P < 0.002) and cortex (F(1,31) = 5.26, P < 0.03). This LPS-induced IDO mRNA expression was attenuated by minocycline in the hippocampus (F(1,31) = 11.69, P < 0.002) and cortex (F(1,31) = 5.26, P < 0.03). It is important to note that IDO mRNA was undetected in saline treated <span class="blue">mice</span>. Therefore, the fold IDO change was relative to the IDO mRNA levels in <span class="blue">mice</span> receiving minocycline prior to LPS.<br><br>Minocycline reduces LPS-induced IL-6, but not IL-1β, in the plasma
Because cytokine signals can be relayed from the periphery to the brain by humoral pathways [56], plasma cytokine levels of IL-6 and IL-1β were determined 4 h post LPS injection. As expected, LPS injection caused a marked increase in plasma IL-1β (F(1,36) = 52.5, P < 0.001) and IL-6 levels (F(1,36) 34.01, P < 0.01). Minocycline pretreatment reduced LPS-induced IL-6 levels in the plasma (F(1,36) 6.68, P < 0.01) but had no significant main effect on LPS-induced IL-1β levels (Fig. 6).<br><br>Minocycline attenuates LPS-induced exaggerated neuroinflammation in aged <span class="blue">mice</span>
Aged BALB/c <span class="blue">mice</span> (22–24 m) have an exaggerated neuroinflammatory response to LPS injection [10,13,14]. Therefore, we next sought to determine if the heightened inflammatory response in the brain of aged <span class="blue">mice</span> was reduced by minocycline. In this experiment, adult and aged <span class="blue">mice</span> were subjected to the minocycline injection regimen and LPS challenge as above. As we have reported previously, MHC II mRNA expression was increased by age (P < 0.03, Fig. 7A)[13,14], but MHC II levels were unaffected by either LPS or minocycline treatment (not shown). Consistent with the data presented in Fig. 2, ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of LPS injection on TLR2 mRNA expression in the hippocampus (F(1,63) = 85.5, P < 0.001). Moreover, LPS caused a greater increase in TLR2 mRNA in the hippocampus of aged <span class="blue">mice</span> compared to adults (LPS × Age interaction, F(1,63) = 12.70, P < 0.01). Furthermore, minocycline pretreatment attenuated LPS-induced TLR2 mRNA levels in both adult and aged <span class="blue">mice</span> (Mino × LPS interaction, F(1,63) = 9.02, P < 0.004).
Parallel to the results for TLR2, LPS caused a greater increase in IL-1β and IDO mRNA levels in hippocampus of aged <span class="blue">mice</span> compared to adults (Age × LPS, F(1,60) = 8.64, P < 0.01 for IL-1β and F(1,60) = 4.0, P < 0.05 for IDO). Minocycline pretreatment attenuated LPS-induced mRNA levels of IL-1β (Mino × LPS, F(1,60) = 8.76, P < 0.01, Fig. 7C) and IDO (Mino × LPS, F(1,60) = 9.7, P < 0.003, Fig. 7D). While LPS induced higher IL-6 mRNA levels in the hippocampus of both adult and aged <span class="blue">mice</span> (F(1,59) = 44.5, P < 0.001), there was not an Age × LPS interaction. Minocycline pretreatment attenuated the LPS-induced increase in hippocampal IL-6 mRNA (Mino × LPS, F(1,59) = 5.4, P < 0.02, Fig. 7E). Taken together these data indicate that minocycline pretreatment was effective in attenuating the exaggerated neuroinflammation in aged <span class="blue">mice</span>.<br><br>
Discussion
In the elderly, systemic infection is associated with an increased frequency of behavioral and cognitive complications [57,58]. We have reported that stimulation of the peripheral immune system in older (20–24 m) BALB/c <span class="blue">mice</span> causes exaggerated neuroinflammation that is paralleled by prolonged sickness [13], impaired working memory [10], and depressive-like behaviors [15]. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms that can modulate cytokine-mediated pathways in the brain. Here we show that minocycline treatment reduced LPS-induced TLR2 expression in BV-2 cells and on microglia isolated from adult <span class="blue">mice</span>. Moreover, we demonstrate that minocycline was effective in facilitating the recovery from LPS-induced sickness and preventing anhedonia in adult <span class="blue">mice</span>. Furthermore, we show that minocycline attenuated LPS-induced neuroinflammation in adults and normalized the exaggerated neuroinflammation in aged <span class="blue">mice</span>.
Our findings, using cell culture and animal experiments, support the notion that minocycline attenuates microglial activation and limits production of inflammatory mediators. For instance, minocycline pretreatment of BV-2 cultures decreased LPS-stimulated cytokine production in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 1A). In BV-2 cells, minocycline also attenuated mRNA expression of inflammatory genes including IL-6, IL-1β, MHC II, and TLR2 (Fig. 1D). These data are consistent with other studies using minocycline and LPS in BV-2 cells [44,59]. Based on these data we next investigated if microglial activation could be attenuated in the brain. Because LPS increases brain cytokine production we expected that MHC II expression would also be increased. Contrary to our predictions, neither MHC II mRNA levels (Fig. 7) in the brain nor MHC II surface expression on microglia (CD11b+/CD45low) (data not shown) were increased by LPS injection. In an EAE model, minocycline reduced microglial expression of MHC II [45], but one key difference from our study is that the induction of EAE pathology requires functional antigen presentation on MHC II [60]. It is postulated that microglia have several activation states that depend on the specific inflammatory stimulus [61]. Thus, in situations of transient peripheral innate immune stimulation, markers in the CNS such as Toll-Like receptors [6] may be indicative of microglia activation. In support of this premise, our data show that LPS injection increases TLR2 surface expression on microglia (CD11b+/CD45low), which is inhibited by minocycline pretreatment (Fig. 2). These data are consistent with other studies showing that central or peripheral LPS challenge increases TLR2 mRNA in the brain [6,14]. Taken together our findings can be interpreted to suggest that minocycline attenuates pathways associated with microglia activation following peripheral LPS challenge.
One of the important findings of this study was that reduction of neuroinflammation by minocycline was associated with facilitated recovery from LPS-induced sickness behavior. These results are akin to our previous work with the anti-oxidant, α-tocopherol [52], and an NFKB decoy inhibitor [62]. Consistent with our previous studies [52,53,62,63], reductions in neuroinflammatory cytokines (Fig. 5) did not prevent the induction of the LPS-induced sickness response (2–4 h), but rather facilitated the recovery from sickness (8–24 h) (Fig. 3A). Recovery may be a critical issue because brain cytokines and the corresponding physiological and behavioral responses are beneficial to the host [1]. The potential risk for a maladaptive response occurs when the normally transient neuroinflammatory response is amplified or protracted [64]. Therefore pharmacological agents, similar to minocycline, that attenuate neuroinflammatory responses, but do not completely inhibit them, may be important in preventing the development of more severe and long-lasting cognitive and behavioral complications.
The results of the sucrose preference experiments support the idea that limiting exposure to neuroinflammation decreases the duration of behavioral responses. For example, while minocycline did not inhibit cytokine expression (Fig. 5) or the induction of sickness (Fig. 3A), minocycline pretreatment completely reversed the reduction in sucrose preference (i.e., anhedonia) associated with LPS injection (Fig. 4). It is also important to mention that while LPS-associated sickness and anhedonia are interrelated, these behaviors can be differentiated from one another. For instance, reduced social exploration was evident 2–24 h post injection (Fig. 3A), but only decreased sucrose preference was exhibited 24 to 39 h later (Fig. 4). This separation between behaviors is consistent with other studies investigating sickness and longer-lasting changes in motivation [15,65,66].
IDO mediated TRP metabolism represents a potential connection between activation of CNS innate immune cells and longer lasting behavioral responses. IDO mediated TRP metabolism in the brain may affect behavior by impacting both serotonin and glutamate pathways [39]. We have reported that IDO induction and activity is amplified in the brain of aged <span class="blue">mice</span> and is associated with prolonged depressive-like behavior [15]. Here we show that IDO mRNA induction is blocked by minocycline in the brain of both adult and aged <span class="blue">mice</span> (Figs. 5&7). These data are consistent with a recent report showing a causal relationship between IDO activity and acute depressive effects in adult CD-1 <span class="blue">mice</span>. In this study, O'Connor et al. report that both 1-methyl tryptophan (a competitive inhibitor of IDO) and minocycline blocked IDO induction and prevented depressive-like immobility in the tail suspension and forced swimming tests [66]. Thus, in the present study, the minocycline blockade of IDO induction may explain the abrogation of LPS-induced anhedonia.
Another interesting finding was that while minocycline pretreatment in adult <span class="blue">mice</span> attenuated LPS-induced brain IL-1β at 4 h (Fig. 5), it had no effect on plasma IL-1β levels (Fig. 6). Because IL-1β signals can be relayed from the periphery to the brain by humoral pathways [5], these findings suggest that minocycline has anti-inflammatory properties within the brain. These data are consistent with related findings that minocycline readily crosses the blood brain barrier to elicit an anti-inflammatory effect [41-43]. With regard to IL-6, minocycline pretreatment attenuated both brain and plasma levels at 4 h post LPS injection. Because circulating IL-6 levels can be increased by CNS mediated pathways including activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis [67] and the sympathetic nervous system [68], the specific reduction in plasma IL-6 by minocycline may reflect the reduction in brain inflammation at 4 h (Fig. 5). In support of this notion, we and others have reported that i.c.v. injection of LPS or IL-1β increase plasma IL-6 levels, but not IL-1β levels [14,68,69].
The final critical finding of this study was that minocycline was effective in attenuating neuroinflammation independent of age. Consistent with other aging and neuroinflammation studies, our data show that LPS caused exaggerated neuroinflammation in aged <span class="blue">mice</span> compared to adults [10,13-15]. It is important to mention that while there was an age-related difference in MHC II expression in the hippocampus of saline treated <span class="blue">mice</span> (Fig. 7A) there was not an age-related difference in IL-1β and IL-6 mRNA levels. These data differ from a previous report using BALB/c <span class="blue">mice</span> showing an increase in IL-6 in older <span class="blue">mice</span> [70]. This may be because the <span class="blue">mice</span> used in the present study were approximately 4 months younger than the <span class="blue">mice</span> used previously. Nonetheless, microglia can be primed or reactive with increased MHC II expression, but do not necessarily produce inflammatory cytokines in this state [19]. The key results are that peripheral LPS injection causes a greater induction of TLR2, IL-1β, and IDO mRNA in the aged brain than in the adult brain and that minocycline pretreatment normalizes this age-related exaggerated neuroinflammation (Fig. 7). These findings are also important because an amplified neuroinflammatory response in the aged brain is a precursor to complications including deficits in working memory, memory consolidation, and depressive-like behavior [9,10,15]. Based on the biochemical and behavioral data obtained from this study, we predict that minocycline will abrogate the prolonged LPS-induced sickness [13] and depressive-like behavior exhibited by aged BALB/c <span class="blue">mice</span> [15]. We acknowledge, however, that future studies are necessary to test these predictions.<br><br>Conclusion
The present study demonstrates that minocycline reduces LPS-induced microglial activation, CNS cytokine production, and behavioral symptoms of sickness (e.g., social withdrawal and anhedonia). These findings are potentially important because they indicate that minocycline can be used to mitigate cytokine expression in the brain and have a beneficial affect on behavioral responses. Taken together, these data support the idea that pharmacological strategies aimed at decreasing neuroinflammation associated with microglial activation are important for improving recovery from sickness and reducing the frequency of neurobehavioral complications.<br><br>List of abbreviations

<h3>pmcA2556924</h3>Are there sensitive subgroups for the effects of airborne particles?
Abstract
Recent studies have shown that particulate air pollution is a risk factor for hospitalization for heart and lung disease; however, little is known about what subpopulations are most sensitive to this pollutant. We analyzed Medicare hospital admissions for heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders (COPD) and pneumonia in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois, between 1985 and 1994. We examined whether previous admissions or secondary diagnoses for selected conditions predisposed <span class="yellow">persons</span> to having a greater risk from air pollution. We also considered effect modification by age, sex, and race. We found that the air-pollution-associated increase in hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases was almost doubled in subjects with concurrent respiratory infections. The risk was also increased by a previous admission for conduction disorders. For COPD and pneumonia admissions, diagnosis of conduction disorders or dysrhythmias increased the risk of particulate matter < 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM(10))-associated admissions. <span class="yellow">Persons</span> with asthma had twice the risk of a PM(10)-associated pneumonia admission and <span class="yellow">persons</span> with heart failure had twice the risk of PM(10)-induced COPD admissions. The PM(10) effect did not vary by sex, age, and race. These results suggest that <span class="yellow">patients</span> with acute respiratory infections or defects in the electrical control of the heart are a risk group for particulate matter effects.

These associations are now well documented but little is known, as yet, of the characteristics of <span class="yellow">persons</span> that put them at increased risk of adverse events related to particulate air pollution. This has been identified as a key data gap (16). Schwartz and Dockery (17) reported that <span class="yellow">persons</span> older than 65 years of age had a somewhat increased risk of death, and this has been confirmed in other studies (18). A more detailed examination of particulate matter-related risk by deciles of age (19) showed the risk beginning to increase at approximately 40 years of age and reaching its maximum for those 75 years of age and older. In addition to age, several studies suggest that <span class="yellow">persons</span> with respiratory illness are at increased risk for cardiovascular effects associated with air pollution. An examination of death certificates on high- and low-air pollution days reported a substantial difference in the proportion of deaths from cardiovascular causes that had respiratory disease as a contributing cause of death (19). A recent follow-up study of a cohort of <span class="yellow">persons</span> with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Barcelona, Spain, found an association between particulate air pollution and all-cause mortality in the cohort (20). The magnitude of the risk per microgram per cubic meter of exposure was substantially greater than that for the general population. Environmental Health Perspectives <br><br> Controlled exposure of animals with chronic bronchitis and control animals to concentrated air particles also demonstrated a potentiating effect of chronic lung disease in the response to airborne particles (21). This has led to the hypothesis that the cardiovascular effects of air pollution are predominantly in <span class="yellow">persons</span> with chronic lung disease. There has been even less done to examine potential modifiers of the effects of airborne particles on hospital admissions. The existing literature on comorbidity shows that comorbidity per se seems to increase the risk of adverse outcomes (22�30). Little is known about the role of these comorbidities as effect modifiers for the effects of air pollution. This study uses data from the Medicare system to examine potential short-term and long-term medical conditions that may increase a <span class="yellow">person</span>'s risk of hospital admissions associated with particulate air pollution. In addition, we examine potential effect modification by age, race, and sex. <br><br> Materials and Methods Health data. The Health Care Financing Administration (Baltimore, MD) maintains records of every hospital admission for Medicare <span class="yellow">participants</span> in the United States. <span class="yellow">Persons</span> in this database have a unique identifier. Using this identifier, we traced every hospital admission for heart and lung disease for each <span class="yellow">person</span> in Cook County, Illinois, between 1985 and 1994. We chose Cook County because it is the most populous <br><br> county in the United States with daily monitoring for particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 10 �m (PM10). The data were then analyzed to look at effect modification by concurrent and preexisting conditions as well as by age, race, and sex. To establish a baseline risk, we computed daily counts of hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease (CVD) [International Classification of Disease, 9th edition, World Health Organization, Geneva (ICD-9) code 390�429], pneumonia (ICD-9 code 480�487), and COPD (ICD-9 code 490�496, excluding 493). The association between these daily counts and PM10 was examined for the years 1988�1994, when daily PM10 monitoring data were available in Chicago. Once our baseline risks were established, we examined three classes of potential effect modifiers. First, we looked at whether previous admissions for selected conditions predisposed <span class="yellow">persons</span> to having a greater risk from air pollution. For each of the three admission categories (CVD, pneumonia, and COPD), we considered 10 causes (defined by a previous admission) as effect modifiers: COPD (ICD-9 code 490�496 except 493), asthma (ICD-9 code 493), acute bronchitis (ICD-9 code 466), acute respiratory illness (ICD-9 code 460�466), pneumonia (ICD-9 code 480�487), CVD (ICD-9 code 390�429), myocardial infarction (ICD-9 code 410), congestive heart failure (ICD-9 code 428), conduction disorders (ICD-9 code 426), and dysrhythmias (ICD9 code 427). To test the hypothesis that <span class="yellow">persons</span> with these conditions had higher risks of subsequent PM10-related admissions, we computed separate daily counts of admissions for our three target causes, stratified by whether or not the <span class="yellow">person</span> admitted had been previously admitted for the hypothesized predisposing condition. Separate analyses were then performed within each strata to see if the effects of PM10 differed by strata. Address correspondence to A.

These could represent the presence of a chronic condition (e.g., COPD) that has not resulted in a previous hospital admission. They could also represent acute conditions that may have increased the subjects' sensitivity to air pollution. For example, if respiratory infections modified the effect of particulate matter on the cardiovascular health of <span class="yellow">persons</span> with underlying heart disease, then the risk of a hospital admission for heart disease might be different in <span class="yellow">persons</span> with infections. If this were true, then the risk ratio of a 10-�g/m3 increase of PM10 on cardiovascular admissions of <span class="yellow">persons</span> with a concurrent respiratory infection would be different from the ratio in <span class="yellow">persons</span> without respiratory infection. To test these hypotheses, we computed separate daily counts of admissions for events with and without the concurrent conditions hypothesized to increase sensitivity to air pollution. These were taken as the same 10 conditions in the first analysis with certain exclusions for pairing that would be illogical. That is, the concurrent diagnosis of a specific cardiac condition was not treated as an effect modifier for admissions for any cardiovascular condition. Likewise, pneumonia and COPD were not possible concurrent conditions for each other. The third set of predisposing conditions considered was being older than 75 years of age, nonwhite, and female. These were examined for all three outcomes. We obtained weather data for O'Hare Airport from the EarthInfo CD-ROM (EarthInfo CD NCDC Surface Airways, EarthInfo Inc., Boulder, CO), and we obtained air pollution data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Aerometric Information Retrieval System network (31). <br><br> running-line smoother, loess (35), was chosen to estimate the smooth function. To control for weather variables and day of the week, we chose the smoothing parameter that minimized the Akaike's information criterion (36). To model seasonality we chose the smoothing parameter that minimized the sum of the autocorrelation of the residuals while removing seasonal patterns. Two autoregressive terms (37) were added in the model to eliminate the remaining serial correlation from the residuals. We used the mean of PM10 on the day of the admission and the day before the admission as our exposure variable. This gives results that are similar to those obtained fitting a full distributed lag model (38). PM10 was treated linearly. Our baseline models used the daily counts of CVD, pneumonia, and COPD admissions as outcomes. We then subdivided those counts by the presence or absence of the potential effect modifier and reestimated our regressions on those subgroups. We considered effect modification to be indicated when the estimates of PM10 in the group with the condition was outside of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the effect estimate in <span class="yellow">persons</span> without the condition. <br><br> Results Table 1 shows the mean daily admissions for COPD, cardiovascular, and pneumonia both overall and in the presence of the potential effect modifiers. For some effect modifiers such as conduction disorders or myocardial infarctions, the counts in conjunction with our respiratory outcomes are <br><br> low, which limits power. In general, the numbers are lower for examining effect modification by previous admissions than for effect modification by concurrent diagnosis. This is as expected because many clinically relevant comorbidities may never have resulted in a hospital admission. Table 2 shows the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile values for the environmental variables. The mean value for PM10 is 33 �g/m3. The daily values for PM10 were computed as the average of 10 monitors, two of which measured PM10 almost every day and the others less frequently (38). Table 3 shows the mean daily counts of CVD, COPD, and pneumonia by sex, age groups, and race. The distribution by sex is almost even, although the counts of admissions for males are generally lower (approximately 10%) than for females, particularly for cardiovascular diseases. The counts of CVD, COPD, and pneumonia admissions were similar for <span class="yellow">people</span> 65�75 or 75 years of age and older. Tables 4�6 show the results for the effect PM10 overall and stratifying by concurrent diagnosis and previous admissions. These are expressed as the percentage increase for 10 �g/m3 PM10. Table 4 shows the results for CVD. A 10-�g/m3 increase in PM10 was associated with a 1.31% (5% CI, 0.97%; 95% CI, 1.66%) increase in hospital admissions for heart disease in all elderly <span class="yellow">persons</span>. A concurrent (not previous) diagnosis of COPD modified the risk of PM10-associated admissions for heart disease. However, significant associations were still seen between PM10 <br><br> Table 1.

A significant association was also seen in <span class="yellow">persons</span> without any respiratory disease as a concurrent diagnosis, although the risk is much lower than in <span class="yellow">persons</span> with respiratory disease. However, the risk associated with PM10 was roughly doubled in subjects with concurrent respiratory infections and the risk estimates in those subjects were outside the 95% CI of the risk in <span class="yellow">patients</span> without concurrent respiratory infections. A previous admission for conduction disorders (e.g., heart block) increased the risk of a PM10-related subsequent admission for any heart condition, and a weaker indication of effect modification was seen for <span class="yellow">persons</span> with previous admission for dysrhythmias. In contrast heart failure and previous myocardial infarctions were highly insignificant as effect modifiers. Table 5 shows the results for COPD. Overall, there is a 1.89% (95% CI, 0.8�3.0) increase in COPD admissions for a 10�g/m3 increase in PM10. The results of the stratified analysis suggest that preexisting heart disease modifies Table 4.

Previous admissions for any cardiovascular disease increased the risk of a PM10associated COPD admission approximately 2.5-fold. A previous heart failure admission caused an even more striking increase in the PM10 effect. Previous admissions for dysrhythmias and conduction defects were rare (Table 1) with no power to examine effect modifications. Listings as concurrent diagnoses were more common and here they joined heart failure in increasing the risk of PM 10 -associated COPD admissions. For COPD there was also some indication that concurrent pneumonia or an acute respiratory infection admission in the last year increased risk. The low numbers made these estimates less precise, however. The percentage increase in pneumonia admission (Table 6) for 10 �g/m3 PM10 is higher than for COPD or CVD with an increase of 2.34% (95% CI, 1.66�3.0). As with COPD, <span class="yellow">persons</span> with heart disease appeared at higher risk of pneumonia hospital admissions associated with particulate air pollution. Here diagnoses suggestive of impaired autonomic control of the heart, such as conduction disorders or dysrhythmias, were associated with increased risk for PM 10 effects on pneumonia admissions. Unlike COPD, no difference was seen for congestive heart failure. <span class="yellow">Persons</span> with asthma Table 5.

Table 7 shows the results by sex, age, and race. None of the effect size estimates for any of the stratification variables were outside of the 95% CI for the opposite strata. There was a tendency for the effect of PM10 on CVD admissions to be higher for females, whereas the effect on pneumonia admissions was higher for males. In general, we found somewhat larger effects on whites compared to nonwhites, and for <span class="yellow">persons</span> older than 75 years of age compared to younger <span class="yellow">persons</span>. <br><br> Discussion In this analysis we examined whether the effect of PM10 on the risk of hospital admission for heart and lung disease was different depending on the presence of comorbidities. We found that PM10 was associated with hospital admissions for all three causes (CVD, COPD, and pneumonia) and we found not a general increase in PM10 related risk with comorbidities, but a specific pattern that is suggestive of potential mechanisms and consistent with other recent epidemiologic and toxicologic findings. One major finding of this study is that preexisting cardiovascular disease, particularly impaired autonomic control (conduction defects and dysrhythmias) and heart failure, substantially increased the risk of respiratory admissions associated with airborne particles. In fact, recent <span class="yellow">human</span> studies have shown that exposure to particulate air pollution is a risk factor for reduced heart rate variability (39�41). Reduced heart rate variability is an adverse response and a risk factor for arrhythmia. A new study of defibrillator discharges in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with implanted cardioverter defibrillators found that discharges were associated with air pollution (42).

This is the first study to suggest <span class="yellow">persons</span> with defects in the electrical control of the heart are also at higher risk of respiratory illness after exposure to airborne particles. These data also suggest that <span class="yellow">persons</span> admitted to hospitals for pneumonia during an air pollution episode may be at high risk for clinically significant conduction disorders during that hospital admission. <span class="yellow">Patients</span> with congestive heart failure were at greater risk of hospital admissions for COPD in association with airborne particles. Heart failure and COPD is not an uncommon combination. The finding that these <span class="yellow">patients</span> are at higher risk for admissions associated with particulate air pollution is new but is also consistent with several other recent reports. The spontaneous hypertensive <span class="yellow">rat</span> develops a model of heart failure, and recent studies have reported greater sensitivity to particulate air pollution in these <span class="yellow">rats</span>. These include both electrocardiogram abnormalities (44) and pulmonary toxicity (45,46). Similarly, in an epidemiologic study, Hoek et al. (47), found a higher relative risk of death with an increase in PM10 for congestive heart failure deaths than other deaths. The potential role of COPD in those heart failure deaths was not examined. Another consistent pattern in our data is of acute respiratory infections increasing susceptibility to airborne particles. Acute bronchitis, or more generally acute upper respiratory illnesses, as well as pneumonia, increased susceptibility to particle-associated admissions for CVD and COPD. The notion that air pollution exacerbates acute respiratory infections is well supported by studies which report associations between airborne particles and hospital admissions for respiratory infections (48,49). Zelikoff et al. (50) exposed <span class="yellow">rats</span> infected with streptococcus to concentrated air particles and reported a significant increase in bacterial burdens and in the extent of pneumonia compared to animals exposed to filtrated air. This suggests an impaired immune response. Similarly, exposure to combustion <br><br> particles enhances influenza infections in <span class="blue">mice</span> (51). An impaired defense to respiratory infection is a major reason that <span class="yellow">persons</span> with COPD require hospital admission. If airborne particles result in further impairment the effect modification we observe makes good sense. The effect modification for heart disease admissions is more relevant. This modification is consistent with the earlier report of Schwartz (19), who found greater reports of respiratory complications on death certificates with an underlying cause of heart disease if the death occurred on a day with high levels of airborne particles. Although airborne particle exposure has been associated with increased exacerbation of asthma (2,12,48,52�59), this paper is the first to suggest that asthmatics are more susceptible to PM10-induced pneumonia exacerbation or to cardiovascular effects. The effects on pneumonia admissions are plausible, given the impaired ability to fight off infections in asthmatics with mucus plugs and the evidence the airborne particles impair the lungs' ability to fight off bacterial and viral infections, as noted earlier. The increased cardiovascular sensitivity, albeit weaker, is interesting. If airborne particles affect the cardiovascular system via the role of the lung in autonomic control, it is possible that asthmatics would be more sensitive to those effects. Animal models of asthma showed that combustion particles enhance the asthmatic response to aeroallergen challenges (59). This suggests an enhancement of pulmonary response in asthmatics. On the other hand, the diagnosis of asthma is problematic in the elderly, and crossover with COPD is possible. The possibility that this explains our results is reduced by our failure to find previous hospital admission for COPD was an effect modifier for the effect of particles on cardiovascular admissions. We must acknowledge several potential limitations of this study. First, we considered only previous admissions that occurred within Cook County. Hence <span class="yellow">persons</span> with previous admissions elsewhere would be misclassified to our reference group. The effect of this would be to reduce the difference in PM 10 effect between the two groups. VOLUME <br><br> Nevertheless, we identified some interesting interactions. We cannot exclude the possibility that there are areas we missed for this reason. We also examined interactions in a log relative risk model, which is inherently multiplicative. Although we believe this is justified because doubling the population exposed would be expected to double the pollution associated admissions, it results in a more conservative definition of interaction than would an additive risk model. Finally, our exposure is clearly measured with error. Most of this error is Berkson error (60) and hence will introduce no bias, and Zeger et al. (60) showed that the remaining error would have to have pathologic correlations with other variables to result in an upward bias. Another important result from this study, of course, is an estimate of the magnitude of the effect of airborne particles on public health. The PM10 concentrations in Chicago during this period were associated with approximately 1,600 additional admissions per year for heart disease, 740 additional admissions per year for pneumonia, and 170 additional admissions per year for COPD. These are not trivial increases in serious morbidity. The results of our study should be replicated in additional cities, although they do begin to fill in some missing information about the effects of airborne particles on health. More generally airborne particles have been associated with a broad range of systemic changes including heart rate variability (39�41), increased peripheral neutrophils (61�63), increased plasma viscosity (64), an increase in blood pressure (65), and the outcomes mentioned previously. The role of these systemic changes as potential sources of the specific effect modifications we have seen should be an area of fruitful research in the future. REFERENCES AND NOTES 1.

Abstract
Introduction
MUC1 is an oncoprotein whose overexpression correlates with aggressiveness of tumors and poor survival of cancer <span class="yellow">patients</span>. Many of the oncogenic effects of MUC1 are believed to occur through interaction of its cytoplasmic tail with signaling molecules. As expected for a protein with oncogenic functions, MUC1 is linked to regulation of proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and transcription.<br><br>Methods
To clarify the role of MUC1 in cancer, we transfected two breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-468 and BT-20) with small interfering (si)RNA directed against MUC1 and analyzed transcriptional responses and oncogenic events (proliferation, apoptosis and invasion).<br><br>Results
Transcription of several genes was altered after transfection of MUC1 siRNA, including decreased MAP2K1 (MEK1), JUN, PDGFA, CDC25A, VEGF and ITGAV (integrin αv), and increased TNF, RAF1, and MMP2. Additional changes were seen at the protein level, such as increased expression of c-Myc, heightened phosphorylation of AKT, and decreased activation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. These were correlated with cellular events, as MUC1 siRNA in the MDA-MB-468 line decreased proliferation and invasion, and increased stress-induced apoptosis. Intriguingly, BT-20 cells displayed similar levels of apoptosis regardless of siRNA, and actually increased proliferation after MUC1 siRNA.<br><br>Conclusion
These results further the growing knowledge of the role of MUC1 in transcription, and suggest that the regulation of MUC1 in breast cancer may be more complex than previously appreciated. The differences between these two cell lines emphasize the importance of understanding the context of cell-specific signaling events when analyzing the oncogenic functions of MUC1, and caution against generalizing the results of individual cell lines without adequate confirmation in intact biological systems.<br><br><br><br>Introduction
MUC1 is the founding member of the mucin family: proteins characterized by heavy O-glycosylation centering around a variable number of tandem repeats that are rich in serine and threonine residues [1,2]. MUC1 is a transmembrane heterodimer with one subunit solely extracellular (MUC1-EX), and the other subunit composed of a short extracellular stem, a single transmembrane domain, and the cytoplasmic tail (together called the MUC1-CT). MUC1 possesses both pro- and anti-adhesive capacities, as the MUC1-EX provides binding sites for a variety of adhesion proteins, while its large size and extended structure prevents cell-cell contact [3-5].
Initially described as a tumor antigen overexpressed in >90% of breast cancers, MUC1 is now known to be an oncogene with roles in both tumor formation and progression [1,6]. <span class="yellow">Mouse</span> studies have been integral to the current understanding of MUC1 in cancer. Muc1 knockout <span class="blue">mice</span> (Muc1-/-; MUC1 is <span class="yellow">human</span>; Muc1 is <span class="yellow">mouse</span>) show a reduction in tumorigenic phenotype when crossed onto <span class="blue">mice</span> overexpressing the Wnt-1 [7] or polyomavirus middle T antigen [8] oncogenes in the mammary gland. In contrast, MUC1 overexpression in the mammary gland drives tumor formation [9], indicating that MUC1 is a true oncogene.
Many of the oncogenic effects of MUC1 stem from its cytoplasmic tail, which binds to several proteins implicated in cancer, including c-Src [10,11] and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family [12,13]. MUC1 stimulates mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling through the extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERK1/2) [12,14]; this can occur through MUC1 association with Grb2 and son of sevenless to activate Ras [15]. ERK1/2 signaling is commonly stimulated by the Ras-Raf-MEK (MAPK and ERK kinase) cascade downstream of mitogens such as EGFR [16], and regulates transcription via factors like the activator protein-1 complex. Loss of MUC1 can reduce EGFR expression [17], providing another means of affecting MAPK signaling. Our results describe a novel mechanism by which MUC1 regulates the ERK1/2 pathway, through modulating transcription of the genes encoding MEK1, Raf-1, and c-Jun.
MUC1 expression correlates with increased survival in response to cytotoxic or oxidative agents [18-21], and can activate the phosphoinositol-3 kinase-AKT pathway as part of an anti-apoptotic response [18]. MUC1 has also recently been linked to transcription, as the MUC1-CT localizes to the nucleus [22] and affects transcription by β-catenin [22,23], FOXO3a [21], p53 [24], and estrogen receptor α [25]. However, there are indications that the role of MUC1 in oncogenesis is regulated by cell type and signaling context. For example, MUC1 can stimulate Fas-mediated apoptosis [26], while Muc1 is specifically down-regulated in c-neu-induced mammary tumors [27]. This report emphasizes the complexity of MUC1 signaling in breast cancer by contrasting results from two established breast cancer cell lines.
To understand MUC1 function in cells with high endogenous expression, that is, cells likely to have evolved with active MUC1 signaling, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to knock down MUC1 in MDA-MB-468 and BT-20 cells. We then analyzed transcription of 84 genes involved in cancer, as well as the effects upon cellular events linked to oncogenesis, such as apoptosis and proliferation. Though the cell lines show some similarity in transcriptional alterations after transfection with MUC1 siRNA, their phenotypes are quite dissimilar: MDA-MB-468 increases apoptosis and reduces proliferation and invasion, while BT-20 proliferates more rapidly after loss of MUC1. This last may reflect the striking amount of active AKT in BT-20; AKT activity is increased in both cell lines after MUC1 siRNA, which agrees with a previous study of MUC1 siRNA [21], but disagrees with results from 3Y1 fibroblasts [18]. Recent studies have emphasized the complex and context-specific regulation of even such classic oncogenes as AKT [28]. The differences between the two breast cancer cell lines in this study suggest that MUC1 oncogenic functions are also subject to cell-specific regulation, and stress the need for understanding the cellular signaling context when interpreting results.<br><br>Materials and methods
Cell culture and siRNA transfection
MDA-MB-468 and BT-20 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) plus 10% fetal <span class="yellow">calf</span> serum, 1% Glutamax (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Stable cell lines (468.Neo and 468.MUC1Δ8) were selected with 0.5 mg/ml G418. For epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation, MDA-MB-468 cells were serum-starved overnight and treated for 10 minutes at 37°C with 100 ng/ml EGF. Transient siRNA transfection was performed with Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) and 100 nM siRNA oligonucleotides. The commercially available siRNA constructs (all from Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, USA) were scrambled (siCONTROL non-targeting siRNA #1), or directed against firefly luciferase (siCONTROL non-targeting siRNA #2) or MUC1 (siGENOME smartpool). The independent oligonucleotides designed in our laboratory target sequences beginning at MUC1 codons 882 and 956, and have been described previously [29]. The scrambled siRNA construct was used only in BT-20 cells as it causes a non-specific knockdown of MUC1 in the MDA-MB-468 line.<br><br>Cloning of MUC1 WT vector and stable transfection
Two silent mutations (G891A and T894C) were introduced into the MUC1 cDNA (called MUC1Δ8) to make it resistant to the 882 siRNA that targets that region of the mRNA. The mutant cDNA was cloned into the pLNCX.1 vector with neomycin resistance (gift of Joseph Loftus, Mayo Clinic, Arizona, USA). Stable transfection was performed with Lipofectamine2000; cells were selected beginning 24 hours post-transfection and maintained as a polyclonal population.<br><br>Western blots and antibodies
Cells were lysed in buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 150 mM sodium chloride, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA) with commercial protease (Complete inhibitor cocktail, Roche, Pleasanton, CA, USA) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mM sodium fluoride, 2 mM sodium vanadate, 50 μM ammonium molybdate). Protein concentration was determined by BCA (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA); 50 μg of lysate were loaded on SDS-PAGE gels for each experiment, except for the pMEK1/2 blot in MDA-MB-468, where 150 μg were used. Non-commercial antibodies used were: BC2, a <span class="yellow">mouse</span> monoclonal to the MUC1-EX (gift of Dr McGuckin, Queensland University, Queensland, Australia), and CT2, an <span class="yellow">Armenian hamster</span> monoclonal to the MUC1-CT developed in our lab [12]. Antibodies to pMEK1/2, MEK1/2, ERK1/2, Myc, pAKT, AKT, β-tubulin (all Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), β-actin and dpERK1/2 (both Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) were used according to manufacturers' recommendations. All antibodies except β-actin (1:2,500) and dpERK1/2 (1:10,000) were used at 1:1,000 dilution for western blots. Flow cytometric analysis of MUC1 was done with HMPV-FITC, which recognizes the core peptide of the MUC1-EX tandem repeats (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) staining was performed with a fluorescently conjugated antibody to BrdU (BrdU-PE, BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) as described below. Densitometry was performed using the public domain ImageJ program (developed at the NIH and available at [30]. Each band was measured in three places; the results were averaged and normalized to tubulin to control for loading.<br><br>Transwell invasion assays
Cells were serum-starved beginning 24 hours post-siRNA transfection. Cells were re-plated in serum-free medium 48 hours post-transfection at 50,000 cells per insert (sized for 24-well plates), with serum-containing medium in the bottom of the growth well as an attractant. Transwell inserts (BD Biosciences) pre-coated with laminin, fibronectin, collagen IV, or control (no matrix) were used, and cells were permitted to invade for 48 hours. At this point (96 hours post-transfection), visual inspection of the growth wells confirmed that negligible numbers of cells went through to the bottom of the plate. Non-invaded cells were swabbed from the tops of half of the inserts ('samples', containing only invaded cells), and retained in the others ('controls', all cells). Inserts were stained for 10 minutes with crystal violet (0.5% in 20% methanol) and washed with water. Membranes were cut out and destained for 10 minutes in 10% acetic acid in a 96-well plate; membranes were removed and absorbance was read at 570 nm. Percent invasion is defined as (absorbance of samples/absorbance of controls) × 100.<br><br>[3H]Thymidine incorporation assays
Cells were re-plated in quadruplicate 24 hours post-siRNA transfection at 15,000 cells/well (96-well plate) with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well), then incubated in normal conditions for 24 hours. At this time (48 hours post-siRNA transfection) excess radioactivity was washed off and the cells were harvested and read on a TopCount plate reader. Statistical analysis was performed using JMP 5.1.2 software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA); the student's t test was used to determine p values and significance was confirmed with Wilcoxon rank sum and Pearson chi squared analyses.<br><br>BrdU incorporation
BrdU (50 μM) was given to cells 48 hours post-siRNA transfection and permitted to incorporate for 1.5 hours. Cells were then washed with PBS, trypsinized, and washed again. BrdU staining was performed according to an adaptation of the manufacturer's protocol: cells were re-suspended in PBS, mixed 1:1 with -20°C neat ethanol, and incubated 1 hour at -20°C to fix. Fixed cells were then washed gently and denatured in 2 M HCl for 20 minutes at room temperature. Following washing and 2 minute's incubation with 0.1 M Tris to neutralize the acid, cells were re-suspended in FACS buffer (0.5% fetal <span class="yellow">calf</span> serum in PBS) and stained with Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-BrdU according to the manufacturer's protocol for flow cytometry analysis on a FACScan instrument.<br><br>Apoptosis and trypan blue staining
Apoptosis was measured using a kit (BD Biosciences) containing propidium iodide (PI) and FITC-conjugated annexin V. Cells were stained according to the manufacturer's protocol and the level of apoptosis determined by flow cytometry. Quadrants are: early apoptosis (annexin V+/PI-, lower right) late apoptosis (annexin V+/PI+, upper right) and non-apoptotic cell death (annexin V-/PI+, upper left). Treatments for the stress panel were: no treatment (control); DMSO as a control for celecoxib; 20 mM celecoxib, brand name Celebrex™ (dissolved in DMSO) [31]; 0.2 mM H2O2 [32]; or 1 mg/mL G418 (Pfizer, New York, NY, USA).<br><br>Real-time PCR arrays
Transcriptional analysis using Cancer PathwayFinder RT2 profiler arrays (SuperArray, Frederick, MD, USA) was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA); 1 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed with the cDNA synthesis kit (SuperArray) and cDNA was subjected to real-time PCR using SYBR green to detect product. Arrays were performed independently at least twice for each cell line; all PCR products were checked on agarose gels. Values were obtained for the threshold cycle (Ct) for each gene and normalized using the average of four housekeeping genes on the same array (HPRT1, RPL13A, GAPD, ACTB). Ct values for housekeeping genes and a dilution series of ACTB were monitored for consistency between arrays. Change (ΔCt) between MUC1 siRNA and control siRNA was found by:
ΔCt = Ct(MUC1 siRNA) - Ct(control siRNA)
and fold change by:
Fold change = 2(-ΔCt)
Values are given as fold change; only genes showing two-fold or greater change were considered. Both luciferase and scrambled siRNA controls were used in BT-20; only genes showing consistent alteration with both controls were included in the results reported here. The scrambled siRNA could be not used in MDA-MB-468 as these cells decrease MUC1 expression in response to this construct.<br><br>
Results
siRNA transfection decreases MUC1 expression in breast cancer cell lines
Two <span class="yellow">human</span> breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-468 and BT-20, were transiently transfected with a pool of four siRNA oligonucleotides directed against the MUC1 mRNA (468.siMUC1 and BT.siMUC1), or a control oligonucleotide directed against luciferase (468.siLuc and BT.siLuc). Both cell lines express high levels of MUC1, making them promising targets for this analysis. Western blots (Figure 1a) show successful knockdown of both the extracellular domain and cytoplasmic tail fragments of MUC1; luciferase siRNA does not substantially change the level of MUC1 compared to parental cells. 468.siMUC1 show a substantial decrease in the amount of MUC1-CT, while BT.siMUC1 show slightly less knockdown of MUC1-CT. Both MDA-MB-468 and BT-20 display a less dramatic decrease of MUC1 extracellular domain compared to MUC1-CT (Figure 1a); this likely represents protein synthesized prior to transfection, and may reflect differences in the turnover rates of the two subunits.
Analysis of the MUC1 extracellular domain by flow cytometry confirms that both cell lines substantially decrease MUC1 expression after siRNA (Figure 1b). By flow cytometry, 468.siMUC1 averaged 75% knockdown of MUC1 compared to 468.siLuc; and BT.siMUC1 averaged 50% knockdown relative to BT.siLuc. These effects could be titrated with the concentration of siRNA, were seen as early as 24 hours post-transfection (data not shown) and lasted to at least 96 h post-transfection (Figure 1b). All experiments were conducted within 48 to 96 hours after siRNA transfection. Similar results were obtained using two independent oligonucleotides designed in our lab (data not shown), designated '882' and '956' for the initial codon recognized by each.<br><br>Transcriptional changes are seen after MUC1 siRNA
Recent work indicates that MUC1 may affect transcription both directly via interaction with transcription factors and indirectly (for example, through modulating signaling). To study the effects of MUC1 knockdown in breast cancer cell lines, real-time PCR arrays were used to analyze transcription of 84 genes implicated in cancer. Only genes with greater than two-fold change were considered. Three genes (MAP2K1, VEGF, PDGFA) were altered two-fold or more after MUC1 siRNA in both MDA-MB-468 and BT-20 cells (Figure 2); two genes (ITGAV, MMP2) changed only in 468.siMUC1; and five genes (TIMP3, RAF1, JUN, TNF, CDC25A) only in BT.siMUC1. This list represents all genes affected greater than two-fold after MUC1 siRNA, rather than a select group. Three genes whose transcription was changed by less than two-fold are shown, two of which (PDGFB and ITGB1) are listed because they relate closely to genes altered by two-fold (PDGFA and ITGAV). The third, MYC, is included because western blots confirmed a substantial change at the protein level (Figure 3a) that may reflect both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation.
Interestingly, transcription of MAP2K1 was decreased in both cell lines after MUC1 siRNA. This gene encodes MEK1, one of the primary regulators of the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway [33], a network that has been linked several times to MUC1 [12,34-36]. We examined MEK1 and MEK2 levels by western blot to confirm decreased protein in MUC1 siRNA-treated cells (Figure 3a), and found that not only were total MEK1/2 levels lower in 468.siMUC1 and BT.siMUC1 compared to controls (0.48 and 0.68 relative to siLuc, respectively), but so were the basal amounts of active (phosphorylated) MEK1/2 (pMEK1/2; 0.12 and 0.42 relative to siLuc, respectively). Both 468.siMUC1 and BT.siMUC1 also showed reduced activation of ERK1/2 (dpERK1/2; 0.21 and 0.27 relative to siLuc, respectively), as would be expected with diminished signaling through MEK1/2; total ERK1/2 levels remain unchanged.
As both lines have high levels of EGFR and thus activate the MEK-ERK cascade intensely when stimulated with EGF [37], siRNA-transfected cells were treated with EGF. Notably, MUC1 siRNA impairs this important oncogenic pathway in MDA-MB-468 cells, as 468.siMUC1 display less pMEK1/2 in response to EGF than do 468.siLuc (Figure 3b). Interestingly, EGF treatment of BT-20 cells results in slightly higher pMEK1/2 levels in BT.siMUC1 compared to BT.siLuc. Though this result seems paradoxical in light of decreased MAP2K1 transcription in BT.siMUC1, it likely results from differential functions of Raf isoforms in combination with the increased RAF1 transcription (Figure 2) and protein level (Figure 3a) in these cells. Specifically, B-Raf is thought to be the main activator of MEK under normal conditions; Raf-1 activates MEK in response to stimulus [38]. Thus, it appears that basal pMEK1/2 levels are not greatly affected by Raf-1 overexpression in BT.siMUC1 cells, likely because MEK is regulated primarily by B-Raf under normal growth conditions. In contrast, when the cells are stimulated (EGF), increased Raf-1 levels in BT.siMUC1 leads to heightened pMEK1/2 (Figure 3b).<br><br>MUC1 siRNA increases apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 but not BT-20
We next examined whether MUC1 knockdown and its associated transcriptional alterations would affect overall cellular events. As several of the genes shown in Figure 2 are important in regulating proliferation and survival, and because of the recently described role of MUC1 in modulating apoptosis in response to cellular stresses [20,21,24], we first analyzed whether MUC1 siRNA would alter apoptosis in these lines. Although there was no change in basal apoptosis in either line (Figure 4a), we observed that the cell lines responded differently when trypsinized for re-plating 24 hours after transfection (Figure 4b). Interestingly, 468.siMUC1 cells show greater apoptosis after trypsinization than do 468.siLuc (49.8% versus 34.0%, respectively), while BT-20 cells from both siRNA treatments display similar levels of apoptosis (around 22%).
To examine whether this phenomenon is specific to trypsin treatment or part of a general stress response involving MUC1, we subjected cells to a panel of stresses and measured cell death. In agreement with the patterns seen with trypsinization, BT.siLuc and BT.siMUC1 respond similarly to all treatments (data not shown), while 468.siMUC1 die more readily than 468.siLuc in response to trypsin, G418, hydrogen peroxide, or celecoxib, a chemotherapeutic that targets the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathway (Figure 4c); these data were confirmed with two independent siRNA constructs (data not shown).
Like the MAPK pathway, AKT signaling has been linked to MUC1 in cancer. Although transcription of AKT was not altered in MUC1 siRNA-treated cells, the results of our apoptosis studies prompted us to investigate levels of AKT further. As expected, the total AKT protein level is not greatly changed after MUC1 siRNA in either cell line, though the active form (pAKT) is increased in both 468.siMUC1 and BT.siMUC1 compared to controls (Figure 3a). This result disagrees with MUC1 activation of the AKT pathway in <span class="yellow">rat</span> 3Y1 cells [18], and may reflect regulation more appropriate to breast cancer cells; this is supported by activation of AKT in response to MUC1 siRNA in other lines [21]. In addition, there is a striking difference in the relative amounts of AKT and pAKT in the two cell lines (Figure 4d). When lysates from both lines are exposed to film for the same length of time (overexposure masks the differences between BT.siLuc and BT.siMUC1 that are apparent in Figure 3a), it is clear that pAKT levels are much higher in BT-20 than in MDA-MB-468, despite lower total AKT expression. This difference in AKT activation between MDA-MB-468 and BT-20 likely contributes to the disparity in their sensitivity to the increased apoptosis expected with loss of MUC1.<br><br>MUC1 siRNA alters proliferation and invasion
As MUC1 is involved in apoptosis, we next analyzed its effects on proliferation. BrdU and [3H]thymidine incorporation were used to analyze proliferation after MUC1 siRNA. 468.siMUC1 cells show a significant decrease in [3H]thymidine incorporation compared to 468.siLuc, while intriguingly, BT.siMUC1 cells show a significant increase in proliferation (Figure 5a). Growth curves mirror these results, as do experiments with the two independent MUC1 siRNA oligonucleotides (data not shown). Note that these assays require trypsinizing cells 24 hours post-transfection; therefore, the results in the MDA-MB-468 line could stem from the changes in apoptosis described in the previous section, rather than a true effect on proliferation. To control for this, we incubated non-trypsinized, siRNA-transfected cells at similar confluence with BrdU to measure incorporation. The 'clumped' profile of cells (contrast to Figure 4b) is likely a result of the acid denaturation (recommended by the antibody manufacturer), as it occurs uniformly in these experiments. BrdU incorporation (Figure 5b) confirms that the [3H]thymidine results are not solely due to alterations in apoptosis, as 468.siMUC1 cells incorporate less BrdU than 468.siLuc; once again, BT.siMUC1 cells show increased proliferation over BT.siLuc.
Given the role of MUC1 in adhesion, we examined whether MUC1 siRNA affects cellular invasion. In transwell assays, BT-20 cells invaded poorly, regardless of the siRNA used (data not shown). However, MDA-MB-468 cells invade more readily, and were analyzed on a panel of three different extracellular matrix proteins. Interestingly, 468.siMUC1 cells display somewhat decreased invasion on collagen IV, laminin, and fibronectin matrices, and on a no-matrix control (Figure 5c), which is in agreement with the trend towards decreased metastasis observed in Muc1-/- × <span class="yellow">MMTV</span>-PyV MT <span class="blue">mice</span> [8].<br><br>Transfection of MUC1 rescues the 468.siMUC1 phenotype
To determine if the above effects are specific to MUC1, we created stable transfectants of the MDA-MB-468 line using empty vector (468.Neo) or a full-length MUC1 construct (468.MUC1Δ8) that is resistant to one of the independent MUC1-directed oligonucleotides ('882'). These cells were maintained in G418-containing medium to retain transgene selection. As expected, 468.MUC1Δ8 cells show higher levels of both the MUC1 extracellular domain and the MUC1-CT than do 468.Neo (Figure 6a). Note that 468.Neo have MUC1 expression comparable to parental MDA-MB-468; the exposures in Figure 6a are lighter than those in Figure 1a, in order to clearly show the relative levels of MUC1 in the stable transfectants. After MUC1 siRNA, 468.MUC1Δ8 lose some MUC1 (likely endogenous protein, which is not siRNA-resistant) but retain high-level expression, while 468.Neo show a decrease in MUC1 levels similar to parental 468.siMUC1 cells (Figures 6a,b). The difference in the amount of MUC1 knockdown between 468.Neo and 468.MUC1Δ8 is highlighted by the purple shading in Figure 6b.
BrdU incorporation (Figure 6c) indicates that 468.Neo show decreased nucleotide incorporation after MUC1 siRNA compared to control (3.3% versus 25.0%, respectively); this is not seen in 468.MUC1Δ8 cells, which show similar levels of BrdU incorporation regardless of the siRNA used (21.5% for luciferase, 23.9% for MUC1). 468.Neo cells display a more dramatic decrease in BrdU incorporation after MUC1 siRNA than what is seen in parental 468.siMUC1 cells, which may reflect the additional stress of being maintained in G418-containing medium. Similarly, analysis of apoptosis in trypsinized cells indicates that the increased apoptosis seen in parental 468.siMUC1 cells is also present in the 468.Neo line after MUC1 siRNA (Figure 6d; 43.6% in control versus 59.6% in MUC1 siRNA). However, in 468.MUC1Δ8 cells, the level of apoptosis after luciferase siRNA (34.1%) is lower than that in 468.Neo cells; MUC1 siRNA increases the amount of apoptosis slightly (42.8%), restoring it to a level similar to that seen in luciferase siRNA-treated 468.Neo cells. Together, these studies suggest that the above-described results are specific to MUC1, as stable transfection of an siRNA-resistant MUC1 rescues the phenotype seen in 468.siMUC1 cells.<br><br>
Discussion
This report describes both the transcriptional alterations seen after transfection with MUC1 siRNA in <span class="yellow">human</span> breast cancer cells and the effects on events such as apoptosis and proliferation. The two cell lines used (MDA-MB-468 and BT-20) were chosen for high expression of MUC1 and a substantial (50% to 75%), consistent decrease in MUC1 expression after siRNA. Both lines have epithelial morphology, form tumors slowly in <span class="yellow">nude mice</span> [37], have mutant p53 [39,40], express EGFR [37], and lack estrogen receptor α [41]. One striking difference between these lines, however, is their response to MUC1 siRNA. MDA-MB-468 cells behave as expected for loss of an oncogene: MUC1 siRNA correlates with increased apoptosis in response to stress, decreased proliferation, and reduced invasion. In contrast, BT.siMUC1 cells proliferate more rapidly than BT.siLuc cells with little effect on apoptosis.
Much of the phenotype of these cells can be understood in light of protein levels and transcriptional activity after MUC1 siRNA. As mentioned, both MDA-MB-468 and BT-20 display increased pAKT after MUC1 siRNA, but the ratio of active to total AKT is considerably higher in the BT-20 line, which may help these cells resist the increased apoptosis expected with loss of MUC1. Myc levels are also higher in both cell lines after MUC1 siRNA, although the ability of Myc to promote proliferation and apoptosis in different cellular contexts [42] complicates the interpretation of this finding.
Both cell lines show reduced transcription of VEGF, PDGFA, PDGFB, and MAP2K1 (MEK1) after MUC1 siRNA. The genes encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the A and B chains of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-A and PDGF-B) are interesting as these proteins have been heavily implicated in angiogenesis, suggesting a novel function for MUC1 in regulating this process. Vascular endothelial growth factor expression in cancer is linked to tumor growth and metastasis [43,44]; platelet-derived growth factor is also angiogenic, but has an additional role in stimulating desmoplasia [45]. Reduced transcription of these genes after MUC1 siRNA suggests that MUC1 may foster angiogenesis and stromal proliferation, although this must be confirmed in a more appropriate model system.
Decreased MAP2K1 (MEK1) transcription after MUC1 siRNA provides a novel mechanism by which MUC1 can affect the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway. MUC1 has often been linked to the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade [12,34-36,46], and at least two mechanisms by which MUC1 can alter MAPK signaling have been described: MUC1 interaction with and phosphorylation by the EGFR family [12,13], and MUC1 binding to the Grb2/Sos complex that activates Ras [46]. Reduction of MEK1 levels after MUC1 siRNA agrees with the role of MUC1 in strengthening MAPK signaling, and indicates that MUC1 can regulate both the transcription and activity of members of this pathway.
Two additional MAPK pathway members are altered specifically in BT.siMUC1, with no corresponding change in 468.siMUC1 cells. These genes are RAF1 and JUN which are increased and decreased, respectively, after MUC1 siRNA. Raf-1 and c-Jun both function outside of the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway, which may explain the seeming paradox of increased RAF1 transcription with simultaneous decreases in MAP2K1 and JUN. Specifically, Raf-1 can inhibit ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulated kinase 1) upstream of p38 and JNK (Jun N-terminal kinase) [38]. ASK1 phosphorylates JNK in response to stress, resulting in activation of c-Jun and stimulation of apoptosis [47], indicating that the coordinate up-regulation of RAF1 and down-regulation of JUN may provide a potent anti-apoptotic effect in BT.siMUC1.
Regulation of life and death is also a hallmark of the CDC25A and TNF gene products. CDC25A is a phosphatase that stimulates cell cycle progression [48], thus the effects of its decrease in BT.siMUC1 are unclear in light of the increased proliferation of these cells. However, the CDC25 proteins (A, B, and C) were recently shown to have greater functional overlap than was previously thought [49], suggesting that the other two isoforms may compensate for reduced CDC25A levels. TNF encodes tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, known for its potent, cell type-specific control of life and death. In tumor cells, TNFα expression can promote proliferation and inhibit apoptosis [50], suggesting that increased TNF transcription in BT.siMUC1 could contribute to the increased proliferation seen in these cells.
Interestingly, the increase in TNF is accompanied by decreased transcription of TIMP3, encoding tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)3. The TIMP family disrupts the function of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), generally resulting in decreased invasion [51]. TIMP3 is unique in that it can also inhibit TNFα converting enzyme (TACE), which activates TNFα by cleaving it from the cell surface [50]. Reduced expression of TIMP3 would, therefore, foster signaling through TNFα by releasing inhibition of TNFα converting enzyme. In agreement with this, TIMP3 can promote apoptosis [52]; thus, its down-regulation in BT.siMUC1 provides another mechanism by which these cells are able to resist the increased apoptosis expected with loss of MUC1.
Another TIMP target responds to MUC1 siRNA, as 468.siMUC1 cells show significantly increased expression of MMP2 (encoding MMP-2/gelatinase A), the product of which degrades type IV collagen [52]. In breast cancer, the ratio of active to latent MMP-2 increases with tumor progression; MMP-2 may facilitate both angiogenesis and metastasis [52]. Its increase after loss of MUC1 is, therefore, unexpected, but at least two factors may clarify this result. First, though MMP-2 levels are increased in <span class="yellow">mouse</span> mammary tumors, its expression is confined to the stroma [53], suggesting that increased MMP2 transcription after loss of the epithelium-specific MUC1 might reflect a shift towards a more mesenchymal phenotype. Second, MMP-2 levels are increased by overexpression of erbB2 [52]; previous studies have shown that erbB2 and Muc1 expression are mutually exclusive in mammary tumors [27], implying that MMP2 might be part of a transcriptional profile linked to low MUC1 levels.
It is intriguing that, despite increased MMP2 transcription, invasion is decreased in 468.siMUC1 cells, even on collagen IV. This may reflect insufficient activation of MMP-2, as the precursor protein must be cleaved for enzymatic function [52]. Alternatively, the slowed invasion of these cells may relate to impaired adhesion resulting from decreased transcription of ITGAV and ITGB1 (αv and β1 integrins, respectively). Integrin signaling is tied to life-or-death decisions in epithelial cells, and integrin expression is vital for processes from wound healing to metastasis [54]. Integrin αvβ3 is implicated in facilitating metastasis of breast cancer cells to bone [55]; decreased transcription of ITGAV after MUC1 siRNA may, therefore, suggest that MUC1 is involved in this lethal process as well.
The MUC1 oncogene has been linked to apoptosis [18,20,26], proliferation [17], and transcription [21,23-25] in cancer. However, the two cell lines chosen for our study display very different responses to MUC1 siRNA, indicating that regulation of MUC1 in breast cancer is likely quite complex and cautioning against over-generalization of results from individual cell lines. Previous reports suggest that, though most studies outline a clearly oncogenic role for MUC1 in breast cancer, the exact details may vary depending on factors such as cell type and signaling context. For example, MUC1 stimulates Fas-mediated apoptosis in CHO cells [26], quite unlike the inhibition of apoptosis seen in other cell lines. Similarly, though MUC1 drives mammary oncogenesis in its own right [9] and facilitates tumorigenesis driven by other oncogenes [7,8], Muc1 is selectively down-regulated in c-neu-induced <span class="yellow">mouse</span> mammary tumors [27], indicating that the context of oncogenic signaling is vital to understanding the function of MUC1.
Thus, it is important to consider the relative levels of knockdown of MUC1 in the two cell lines: BT-20 cells reduce MUC1 expression after siRNA less strongly than do MDA-MB-468 (50% versus 75% knockdown, respectively). As MUC1 serves as a scaffold [11], overexpression of MUC1 relative to its associated signaling proteins might create a dilution effect, sequestering signal transducers away from each other; this would be relieved by MUC1 siRNA. Thus, enough MUC1 may be retained in BT.siMUC1 cells for its oncogenic effects, while signaling complex formation would be enhanced by lowering the amount of MUC1 relative to other signaling proteins.<br><br>Conclusion
The contrast between the MDA-MB-468 and BT-20 lines in response to MUC1 siRNA serves as a reminder that simplified models such as cell lines fail to encompass the complexity of intact biological systems. This report describes transcriptional alterations seen after MUC1 knockdown: decreased transcription of MAP2K1, VEGF, PDGFA, ITGAV, TIMP3, CDC25A, and JUN, and increased transcription of MMP2, TNF, and RAF1. The alterations in MAP2K1, RAF1, and JUN represent a novel means by which MUC1 can affect ERK1/2 signaling: transcriptional regulation of MAPK pathway members. Oncogenic events are also altered in both cell lines after MUC1 siRNA. These results strengthen the growing ties linking MUC1 and transcriptional regulation, and suggest that the role of MUC1 in breast cancer may be more complex than a direct correlation between MUC1 level and oncogenic function.<br><br>Abbreviations

<h3>pmcA2435603</h3>Potentiation of Nerve Growth Factor-Induced Neurite Outgrowth by Fluvoxamine: Role of Sigma-1 Receptors, IP3 Receptors and Cellular Signaling Pathways
Abstract
Background
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been widely used and are a major therapeutic advance in psychopharmacology. However, their pharmacology is quite heterogeneous. The SSRI fluvoxamine, with sigma-1 receptor agonism, is shown to potentiate nerve-growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite outgrowth in PC 12 cells. However, the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying potentiation by fluvoxamine are not fully understood. In this study, we examined the roles of cellular signaling pathways in the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by fluvoxamine and sigma-1 receptor agonists.<br><br>Methods and Findings
The effects of three SSRIs (fluvoxamine, sertraline, paroxetine) and three sigma-1 receptor agonists (SA4503, 4-phenyl-1-(4-phenylbutyl) piperidine (PPBP), and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-sulfate) on NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells were examined. Also examined were the effects of the sigma-1 receptor antagonist NE-100, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptor antagonist, and specific inhibitors of signaling pathways in the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by selective sigma-1 receptor agonist SA4503. Fluvoxamine (but not sertraline or paroxetine) and the sigma-1 receptor agonists SA4503, PPBP, and DHEA-sulfate significantly potentiated NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The potentiation by fluvoxamine and the three sigma-1 receptor agonists was blocked by co-administration of the selective sigma-1 receptor antagonist NE-100, suggesting that sigma-1 receptors play a role in blocking the enhancement of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Moreover, the potentiation by SA4503 was blocked by co-administration of the IP3 receptor antagonist xestospongin C. In addition, the specific inhibitors of phospholipase C (PLC-γ), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), p38MAPK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways blocked the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503.<br><br>Conclusion
These findings suggest that stimulation of sigma-1 receptors and subsequent interaction with IP3 receptors, PLC-γ, PI3K, p38MAPK, JNK, and the Ras/Raf/MAPK signaling pathways are involved in the mechanisms of action of sigma-1 receptor agonists such as fluvoxamine and SA4503.<br><br><br><br>Introduction
Selective serotonin (5-HT; 5-hydroxytryptamine) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have emerged as a major therapeutic advance in psychopharmacology. SSRIs are the treatment of choice for many indications, including major depressive disorder, dysthymia, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. In contrast, it is well known that their pharmacology is quite heterogeneous, although all of them block 5-HT transporters, thus increasing 5-HT levels throughout the central nervous system (CNS) [1]–[9].
Accumulating evidence suggests that sigma-1 receptors, which are intracellular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins, are involved in both the neuroplasticity and pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric diseases such as major depressive disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease [10]–[18]. Previously, we reported that some SSRIs possess high to moderate affinities for sigma-1 receptors in the <span class="yellow">rat</span> brain. The rank order of SSRIs affinities for sigma-1 receptors is fluvoxamine (Ki = 36 nM)>sertraline (Ki = 57 nM)>>paroxetine (Ki = 1893 nM) [19]. Recently, we reported that fluvoxamine, but not paroxetine, significantly ameliorated cognitive deficits in <span class="blue">mice</span> after repeated phencyclidine administration, and that the effects of fluvoxamine were antagonized by co-administration of the selective sigma-1 receptor antagonist NE-100 [20], suggesting that sigma-1 receptors are involved in the mechanism of action of fluvoxamine [9]. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that sigma-1 receptor agonists including fluvoxamine could potentiate nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, and that NE-100 blocked the potentiation by sigma-1 receptor agonists, suggesting sigma-1 receptors are involved in neuroplasticity [21]. However, the precise cellular mechanisms underlying the potentiation by sigma-1 receptor agonists are not fully understood [13], [21].
It is therefore of great interest to study the precise cellular mechanisms underlying the enhancement by fluvoxamine on NGF-induced neurite sprouting in PC12 cells. In the present study, we examined the effects of three SSRIs (fluvoxamine, sertraline, paroxetine), as well as the effects of a sigma-1 receptor agonist (4-phenyl-1-(4-phenylbutyl) piperidine (PPBP), dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEA)-sulfate) [9], [22]–[28] and the selective sigma-1 receptor agonist SA4503 [29], [30], on NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Furthermore, it is also known that sigma-1 receptors have been shown to interact with IP3 receptors (17,18). Therefore, we examined the effects of NE-100 and xestospongin C (a selective inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptor antagonist) [31] in order to investigate the roles of sigma-1 receptors and IP3 receptors in the mechanisms underlying the enhancement of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503. Moreover, we examined the effects of specific inhibitors of several cellular signaling targets on the enhancement of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503, since several signal transduction molecules have been implicated in NGF-induced neurite outgrowth [32].<br><br>Materials and Methods
Drugs
The drugs were obtained from the following sources: fluvoxamine maleate (Solvay Seiyaku K.K., Tokyo, Japan); paroxetine hydrochloride, dehydroepiandosterone-sulfate (DHEA-sulfate), LY294002 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA); sertraline (Toronto Research Chemicals Inc., North York, ON, Canada); SA4503 (M's Science Corporation, Kobe, Japan); NGF (Promega, Madison, WI); xestospongin C, lovastatin, PD98059, GW5074, SB203580, MEK 1/2 inhibitor (SL327), and SP600125 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem, San Diego, CA). The selective sigma-1 receptor antagonists NE-100 and 4-phenyl-1-(4-phenylbutyl) piperidine (PPBP) were synthesized in our laboratory. Other drugs were purchased from commercial sources.<br><br>Cell culture
PC12 sells (RIKEN Cell Bank, Tsukuba, Japan) were cultured at 37°C, 5% CO2 with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal <span class="yellow">bovine</span> serum (FBS), 10% heat-inactivated <span class="yellow">horse</span> serum, and 1% penicillin. The medium was changed two or three times a week. PC12 cells were plated onto 24-well tissue culture plates coated with poly-D-lysine/laminin. Cells were plated at relatively low density (0.25×104 cells/cm2) in DMEM medium containing 0.5% FBS, 1% penicillin streptomycin. Medium containing a minimal level of serum (0.5% FBS) was used, since serum is known to contain steroid hormones that bind to sigma-1 receptors [21]. First, we examined the optimal concentration of NGF for NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. NGF (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40 ng/ml) increased the number of cells with neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 1). In the subsequent studies, 2.5 ng/ml of NGF was used to study the potentiating effects of sigma-1 receptor agonists on NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Twenty-four hours after plating, the medium was replaced with DMEM medium containing 0.5% FBS and 1% penicillin streptomycin with NGF (2.5 ng/ml) with or without several drugs.<br><br>Quantification of neurite sprouting
Five days after incubation with NGF (2.5 ng/ml) with or without the several drugs, morphometric analysis was performed on digitized images of live cells taken under phase-contrast illumination with an inverted microscope linked to a camera. Images of three fields per well were taken, with an average of 100 cells per field. Differentiated cells were counted by visual examination of the field; only cells that had at least one neurite with a length equal to the cell body diameter were counted, and were then expressed as a percentage of the total cells in the field. The counting was performed in a blinded manner.<br><br>Immunocytochemistry
Cells were fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton and blocked with 1.5% normal <span class="yellow">goat</span> serum, 0.1% <span class="yellow">bovine</span> serum albumin (BSA) in 0.1 M phosphate-buffer saline for 1 h to reduce nonspecific binding. Cells were incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) antibodies (1∶1000 dilution in blocking solution, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA, USA). The immunolabeling was visualized with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa-488 (1∶1000; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). MAP-2 immuncytochemistry was visualized with a fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 200, Carl Zeiss, Oberkocken, Germany).<br><br>Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as means±S.E.M. Statistical analysis was performed by using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the post hoc Bonferroni/Dunn test. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.<br><br>
Results
Effects of SSRIs on NGF-induced neurite outgrowth
Fluvoxamine (0.1, 1.0, or 10 µM) significantly increased the number of cells with neurite outgrowth by NGF (2.5 ng/ml) in PC12 cells, in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 2 and 4). In contrast, sertraline (0.1, 1.0, or 10 µM) and paroxetine (0.1, 1.0, or 10 µM) did not increase the number of cells with neurite outgrowth by NGF (2.5 ng/ml). A higher concentration (10 µM) of paroxetine and sertraline significantly decreased the number of cells with NGF-induced neurite outgrowth, suggesting the cellular toxicity of these drugs in PC12 cells (Figure 2).<br><br>Role of sigma-1 receptors in the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by fluvoxamine and SA4503
The selective and potent sigma-1 receptor agonist SA4503 (0.01, 0.1, or 1.0 µM) significantly increased the number of cells with neurite outgrowth by NGF (2.5 ng/ml) in PC12 cells, in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 3 and 4). In addition, other sigma-1 receptor agonists–PPBP (0.1, 1.0, or 10 µM) [22]–[26] and DHEA-sulphate (0.1, 1.0, or 10 µM) [9], [27], [28]–significantly increased the number of such cells, also in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 3). In the absence of NGF, sigma-1 receptor agonists did not produce neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (data not shown).
To investigate the role of sigma-1 receptors, we examined the effects of NE-100 (a selective sigma-1 receptor antagonist) on the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by fluvoxamine, SA4503, PPBP, and DHEA-sulphate. Co-administration of NE-100 (1.0 µM) significantly blocked such potentiation by fluvoxamine (10 µM), SA4503 (1.0 µM), PPBP (10 µM), or DHEA-sulphate (10 µM) (Figure 2 and 3). Furthermore, administration of NE-100 (1.0 µM) alone did not alter NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (Figure 2).<br><br>Role of IP3 receptors in the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503
Sigma-1 receptors have been shown to interact with IP3 receptors (17,18,33–35). To investigate the role of IP3 receptors in the effects of SA4503 on NGF-induced neurite outgrowth, we examined the effects of xestospongin C (a selective, reversible, and membrane-permeable inhibitor of IP3 receptors) [31] on the effects of SA4503 on NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Co-administration of xestospongin C (1.0 µM) significantly blocked the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503 (1.0 µM) (Figure 5). Furthermore, administration of xestospongin C (1.0 µM) alone did not alter NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (Figure 5).<br><br>Role of signaling molecules proximal to TrkA in the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503
Next, we examined the effects of the specific inhibitors of PLC-γ, PI3K, p38 MAPK, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), since these signaling molecules are activated upon the addition of NGF [36]. The PLC-γ inhibitor (U73122; 1.0 µM), PI3K inhibitor (LY294002; 1.0 µM), p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580; 1.0 µM), and JNK inhibitor (SP600125; 1.0 µM) significantly blocked the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503 (1.0 µM) (Figure 6). In contrast, these inhibitors alone did not alter NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (Figure 6).<br><br>Role of Raf/Ras/ERK/MAPK pathway in the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503
The Raf/Ras/ERK/MAPK pathway is known to be involved in NGF-induced outgrowth [32]. Therefore, we examined the effects of this pathway's specific inhibitors. The Ras inhibitor (GW5074; 1.0 µM), Raf inhibitor (lovastatin; 1.0 µM), MEK1/2 inhibitor (SL327; 1.0 µM), and MAPK inhibitor (PD98059; 1.0 µM) significantly blocked the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503 (1.0 µM) (Figure 7). In contrast, these inhibitors alone did not alter NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (Figure 7).<br><br>
Discussion
In the present study, we found that fluvoxamine (but not sertraline or paroxetine) and the sigma-1 receptor agonists (SA4503, PPBP, DHEA-sulfate) could potentiate NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, and that the effects of these drugs were blocked by co-incubation with the selective sigma-1 receptor antagonist NE-100. These findings suggest that agonism at sigma-1 receptors for these drugs is involved in the mechanisms underlying the drugs' potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth.
As shown in Figure 1, NGF increased the number of cells with neurite outgrowth in PC12, in a concentration dependent manner. To examine whether or not the NGF levels are altered by incubation with sigma-1 receptor agonists, we measured the levels of NGF in PC12 cells with or without sigma-1 receptor agonist SA4503. No differences of NGF levels were shown in the between control group and SA4503-treated group (data not shown). It is, therefore, unlikely that the potentaition of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by sigma-1 receptor agonists might be due to increased levels of NGF.
Unlike fluvoxamine, sertraline, which has a moderate affinity for sigma-1 receptors, did not alter NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. The reasons underlying this discrepancy between these two SSRIs are currently unclear. One possibility may involve the difference in pharmacological actions (agonist vs. antagonist) between these SSRIs at sigma-1 receptors. Interestingly, we recently found that, in a novel object recognition test, phencyclidine-induced cognitive deficits could be significantly improved by subsequent subchronic (14 days) administration of fluvoxamine, but not of sertraline, suggesting that sigma-1 receptor agonism is involved in fluvoxamine's mechanism of action [9], Ishima et al., submitted. Taken together, these findings suggest that fluvoxamine and sertraline may function as an agonist and an antagonist at sigma-1 receptors, respectively, although further study is necessary. Another possibility may be that other pharmacological activities of sertraline mask the effects of sigma-1 receptor agonism. In this study, we also found that high concentration (10 µM) of paroxetine and sertraline, but not fluvoxamine, showed cytotoxicity in PC12 cells, suggesting that fluvoxamine may be a safe drug than paroxetine and sertraline.
Sigma-1 receptors have been shown to affect intracellular Ca2+ signaling, although the precise molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this effect are unknown. Sigma-1 receptors bind to IP3 receptors in ER, and sigma-1 receptors regulate Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ storage sites [12]. Very recently, Hayashi and Su [17] reported that sigma-1 receptors function as novel ligand-operated chaperones that specifically target mitochondrion-associated ER membrane. Furthermore, sigma-1 receptors form Ca2+-sensitive chaperone machinery with another chaperone, BiP, and prolong Ca2+ signaling from ER into mitochondria by stabilizing IP3 receptors at mitochondrion-associated ER membrane [17]. In this study, we found that the IP3 receptor antagonist xestospongin C significantly blocked the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503, suggesting the role of IP3 receptors on sigma-1 receptor-mediated potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Therefore, it is likely that stimulation at sigma-1 receptors by sigma-1 receptor agonists and subsequent interaction with IP3 receptors are involved in the mechanism underlying the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by sigma-1 receptor agonists.
NGF binds to the high-affinity tyrosine receptor TrkA, initiating several signaling pathways affecting both morphological and transcriptional targets [32], [36], [37]. The signaling molecules, including PLC-γ, PI3K, p38 MAPK, and JNK, are activated upon the addition of NGF [38]. PLC-γ catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3). DAG activates protein kinase C, and IP3 promotes transient release of Ca2+ from the ER [39]. The pathway via PLC-γ is responsible for NGF-induced cell differentiation [40] and neurite outgrowth [41]. Furthermore, stimulation of PI3K is reported to be involved in the promotion of neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells [42]. In this study, we found that the PLC-γ inhibitor U73122 and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 significantly blocked the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503. Moreover, we found that both the p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 significantly blocked the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503. In addition, it is also interesting that neurite outgrowth induced by low concentration (2.5 ng/ml) of NGF was not blocked by these inihibitors, consistent with a previous report [43], [44], suggesting the existence of novel pathway(s) for NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. These findings suggest that the PLC-γ, PI3K, p38MAPK, and JNK signaling pathways are involved in the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by sigma-1 receptor agonists (Figure 8). In addition, we found that the specific inhibitors for the Raf/Ras/MEK/MAPK pathways significantly blocked the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503, suggesting that these pathways are involved in the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by sigma-1 receptor agonists (Figure 8).
Our recent positron emission tomography (PET) study demonstrated that, after a single oral administration, fluvoxamine bound to sigma-1 receptors in the living <span class="yellow">human</span> brain [45]. This finding suggests that sigma-1 receptors are involved in the mechanism of action of fluvoxamine in the <span class="yellow">human</span> brain [45]. Taken together, the past and present findings suggest that, unlike paroxetine and sertraline, the SSRI fluvoxamine, with its sigma-1 receptor agonistic activity, might be a unique therapeutic drug for neuropsychiatric diseases.
In conclusion, the present results suggest that, as a sigma-1 receptor agonist, fluvoxamine could potentiate the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Furthermore, it is likely that interaction with IP3 receptors and several subsequent signaling molecules are involved in the mechanism underlying the pharmacological action of sigma-1 receptor agonists. Therefore, it is likely that sigma-1 receptor agonists such as fluvoxamine and DHEA-sulfate, which are available around the world, would be unique therapeutic drugs for neuropsychiatric diseases.<br><br>
<h3>pmcA2518116</h3>CHEK2 Mutations Affecting Kinase Activity Together With Mutations in TP53 Indicate a Functional Pathway Associated with Resistance to Epirubicin in Primary Breast Cancer
Abstract
Background
Chemoresistance is the main obstacle to cure in most malignant diseases. Anthracyclines are among the main drugs used for breast cancer therapy and in many other malignant conditions. Single parameter analysis or global gene expression profiles have failed to identify mechanisms causing in vivo resistance to anthracyclines. While we previously found TP53 mutations in the L2/L3 domains to be associated with drug resistance, some tumors harboring wild-type TP53 were also therapy resistant. The aim of this study was; 1) To explore alterations in the TP53 gene with respect to resistance to a regular dose epirubicin regimen (90 mg/m2 every 3 week) in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with primary, locally advanced breast cancer; 2) Identify critical mechanisms activating p53 in response to DNA damage in breast cancer; 3) Evaluate in vitro function of Chk2 and p14 proteins corresponding to identified mutations in the CHEK2 and p14(ARF) genes; and 4) Explore potential CHEK2 or p14(ARF) germline mutations with respect to family cancer incidence.<br><br>Methods and Findings
Snap-frozen biopsies from 109 <span class="yellow">patients</span> collected prior to epirubicin (as preoperative therapy were investigated for TP53, CHEK2 and p14(ARF) mutations by sequencing the coding region and p14(ARF) promoter methylations. TP53 mutastions were associated with chemoresistance, defined as progressive disease on therapy (p = 0.0358; p = 0.0136 for mutations affecting p53 loop domains L2/L3). Germline CHEK2 mutations (n = 3) were associated with therapy resistance (p = 0.0226). Combined, mutations affecting either CHEK2 or TP53 strongly predicted therapy resistance (p = 0.0101; TP53 mutations restricted to the L2/L3 domains: p = 0.0032). Two <span class="yellow">patients</span> progressing on therapy harbored the CHEK2 mutation, Arg95Ter, completely abrogating Chk2 protein dimerization and kinase activity. One <span class="yellow">patient</span> (Epi132) revealed family cancer occurrence resembling families harboring CHEK2 mutations in general, the other <span class="yellow">patient</span> (epi203) was non-conclusive. No mutation or promoter hypermethylation in p14(ARF) were detected.<br><br>Conclusion
This study is the first reporting an association between CHEK2 mutations and therapy resistance in <span class="yellow">human</span> cancers and to document mutations in two genes acting direct up/down-stream to each other to cause therapy failure, emphasizing the need to investigate functional cascades in future studies.<br><br><br><br>Introduction
Chemoresistance is the main obstacle to cure in most malignancies, including breast cancer. While adjuvant chemotherapy may reduce the hazard rate of relapse by about one third in breast cancer <span class="yellow">patients</span> [1], the majority among <span class="yellow">patients</span> harboring micro- metastases are not cured by today's standards. Considering <span class="yellow">patients</span> harboring distant metastases, resistance and therapy failure inevitably occurs, in general over a time period of less than one year for each individual regimen [2].
Despite extensive experimental research [3], little data are available considering chemoresistance in vivo. For anthracycline therapy in breast cancer, topoisomerase-II amplifications have been associated with a dose-responsiveness different from what is observed in non-amplified tumors 4, 5. Several studies have tried to generate “prediction profiles” based on gene expression microarrays [6], [7], [8], however, none of the different profiles generated expressed a sensitivity suitable for clinical applications, or have been successfully reproduced by others (see references to original works in [9] and [10]).
p53 (the protein encoded by the TP53 gene) plays a key role in executing DNA-damage induced apoptosis and growth arrest [11]. Previously, our group reported mutations in the zink-binding domains L2 (codons 163–195) and L3 (codons 236–251) of p53 critical to DNA binding [12] to be associated with but not fully predictive for resistance to chemotherapy with a low-dose weekly anthracycline [13] or a mitomycin plus 5-fluoro-uracil containing [14] regimen. Similar findings were reported by another group [15]. In contrast, others reported TP53 mutations to predict sensitivity to a dose-dense epirubicin-cyclophosphamide regimen [16].
The finding that some tumors harboring wild-type TP53 may be resistant to anthracycline therapy lead us to postulate that other genes involved in the p53 pathway could be mutated in these tumors [3]. p53 is activated by post-translational modifications, and the protein is phosphorylated at multiple amino acids [17]. Phosphorylation at Ser 20 (Ser 23 in <span class="blue">mice</span>) by the Chk2 protein (coded by the CHEK2 gene) in response to DNA damage activates p53 by inhibiting binding to, and deactivation by, the MDM2 (<span class="yellow">Mouse</span> Minute 2 homolog; HDM2) protein [18], [19], [20]. While experimental studies have suggested a critical role of Chk2 in activating p53 apoptotic response to genotoxic stress [21], [22], others claim Chk2 to be dispensable for p53 activation with respect to apoptosis as well as growth arrest [23]. Following an initial report of a CHEK2 germline mutation in a family filling the characteristics of a Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) [24], recent papers have suggested germline mutations in CHEK2 to be associated with a moderately increased risk of breast and colon cancers (see references in [25]). Recently, we discovered a somatic, nonsense CHEK2 mutation in a single <span class="yellow">patient</span> expressing resistance to doxorubicin low dose therapy [26].
A second mechanism of p53 activation is through p14(ARF) (p19 in <span class="blue">mice</span>) function. p14(ARF) does not phosphorylate p53, but inhibits MDM2 dependent p53 degradation through direct MDM2 binding. While p14(ARF)-mediated p53 activation has been linked to oncogene-induced p53 activation and, in general, considered not involved in response to DNA damage (see references in [27]), p14(ARF) may be activated through the E2F1/retinoblastoma pathway [28]. Importantly, two recent studies revealed lack of p19 (<span class="yellow">mouse</span> homologue of <span class="yellow">human</span> p14(ARF)) function in <span class="blue">mice</span> to inhibit p53 tumor suppressor function in response to ionizing radiation as well as DNA damaging agents [29], [30].
The aim of this study was 1) to explore alterations in the TP53 gene with respect to resistance to a regular dose epirubicin regimen (90 mg/m2 body surface every 3 week) in <span class="yellow">patient</span> with primary, locally advanced, breast cancer; 2) To explore defects in potential mechanisms activating p53 in response to DNA damage in breast cancer as a cause of drug resistance in wild-type tumors. To do so, we sequenced the complete coding regions for the CHEK2 and p14(ARF) genes and analyzed for p14(ARF) promoter hypermetylations; 3) Evaluate in vitro function of potential Chk2 and p14(ARF) protein translates corresponding to identified mutations in the CHEK2 and p14(ARF) genes; 4) Identify potential TP53, CHEK2 and p14(ARF) mutations to be germline, explore the incidence of different cancers among affected relatives with respect to specific mutations. By comparing in vitro characteristics of specific mutations to drug sensitivity and family cancer risk syndromes, this may add to our understanding of the importance of these gene cascades executing response to DNA damage versus tumor suppression activity.
Analyzing tumor samples from a total of 109 primary locally advanced breast cancer <span class="yellow">patients</span> treated with epirubicin 90mg/3 weekly, we found TP53 mutations affecting the L2/L3 domains or protein dimerization, as well as non-functional CHEK2 mutations abrogating dimerization and phosphorylation, to be associated with therapy resistance; no mutation or promoter hypermethylations of the p14(ARF) gene was discovered. Our findings suggest a critical role for Chk2 with respect to DNA-damage-dependent p53 activation and resistance to anthracycline therapy in <span class="yellow">human</span> breast cancer.<br><br>Materials and Methods
<span class="yellow">Patients</span>
A total of 223 <span class="yellow">patients</span> with locally advanced non-inflammatory breast cancer (T3-4 and/or N2) were randomly allocated to primary treatment either with epirubicin 90 mg/m2 or paclitaxel 200 mg/m2. The primary aim of the study was identification of markers predicting drug resistance to the regimens. Thus, the reason for randomizing <span class="yellow">patients</span> was not for effect comparison, but to achieve similar <span class="yellow">patient</span> cohorts in the two arms. Based on the findings of a clinical lack of cross-resistance between anthracyclines and taxane therapies in breast cancer [31], we hypothesized the mechanisms of resistance to be different between the two compounds. While the analysis of tumor samples from the paclitaxel is ongoing, we here report our findings from the <span class="yellow">patients</span> allocated to the epirubicin arm.
The epirubicin arm included a total of 109 <span class="yellow">patients</span> (age 28 to 70 years, median 51 years). Two <span class="yellow">patients</span> were analyzed for gene mutations but omitted from statistical analysis as protocol violators; histopathological examination revealed one <span class="yellow">patient</span> (Epi089) to harbor a sarcomatoid tumor, while one <span class="yellow">patient</span> Epi232 was erroneously enrolled with stage II disease.
The study protocol was approved by the Regional Ethical Committee (Norwegian Health Region III), including formal Biobank registration in accordance to Norwegian law. The study and protocol is registered under the Norwegian Social Science Data services ((www.nsd/uib/personvern/database/), University of Bergen project no 16297 and Helse Bergen project no 13025). Each <span class="yellow">patient</span> gave written informed consent.<br><br>Tissue Sampling
Before commencing chemotherapy, each <span class="yellow">patient</span> had an incisional tumor biopsy as described previously [14]. All tissue samples were snap-frozen immediately on removal in the theatre.<br><br>Treatment Regime and Staging
Primary treatment consisted of epirubicin (90 mg/m2) administered as a 3-weekly schedule. Treatment was scheduled for four cycles unless progression occurred at an earlier stage. Clinical response was assessed before each treatment cycle, and the final response evaluated 3 weeks after the 4th cycle for overall response classification. Because the protocol was implemented by October 1997 with <span class="yellow">patients</span> enrolled between November 1997 and December 2003, responses were consistently graded by the UICC system [32] and not the more recently implemented “RECIST” criteria [33]. Thus, responses were classified as CR (Complete Response, complete disappearance of all tumor lesions), PR (Partial Response, reduction ≥50% in the sum of all tumor lesions, calculated for each as the product of the largest diameter and the one perpendicular to it), PD (Progressive Disease, increase in the diameter product of any individual tumor lesion by ≥25%), and SD (Stable Disease, anything between PR and PD). To analyze for the predictive value of the different parameters, similar to our previous studies [13], [14] we compared PD tumors (non responders) with the combined group of tumors classified as SD/PR/CR (responders); the reason for this approach is discussed in detail elsewhere [34]. Median follow-up time was defined from <span class="yellow">patient</span> inclusion in the study up to October 31, 2006. Deaths attributable to causes other than breast cancer were treated as censored observations.
All <span class="yellow">patient</span> records were subject to central audit for response classification (by E.L., B.Ø. and P.E.L.). Response classifications were completed and approved without any knowledge about result from laboratory analysis.<br><br>RNA Purification
Total RNA was purified by Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) extraction from snap-frozen tissue samples according to manufacturer's instructions. After extraction, the RNA was dissolved in 100 µl of DEPC treated ddH2O. cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using Transcriptor reverse transcriptase (Roche), according to the manufacturer's protocol.<br><br>DNA Purification
Genomic DNA from tumor biopsies and blood lymphocytes was isolated using QIAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.<br><br>Mutation Analysis
All mutational analysis was performed blinded to clinical data. Mutations in TP53, CHEK2 and p14(ARF) genes were analyzed by PCR (or nested PCR) amplification and sequencing of PCR product, or by cloning of PCR products and sequencing of the resulting plasmids (all primers described in Table 1). Cloning was performed using the TOPO TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen). Sequencing of clones was performed until at least 10 different sequences covered all parts of the CHEK2 coding sequence. DNA sequencing was carried out directly on 1 µl PCR product or plasmid using Big Dye terminator mix (Applied Biosystems). Capillary gel electrophoresis, data collection, and sequence analysis were done on an automated DNA sequencer (ABI 3700). When a mutation was detected, the relevant exon was amplified by PCR from genomic tumor DNA and DNA from blood lymphocytes and sequenced for verification and germline detection. (Primers described in Table 1).<br><br>Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)
Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in tumors with mutations in CHEK2 was assessed using the microsatellite marker, D22S275, which maps to intron 4 of CHEK2. LOH in tumors with mutation in TP53 was assessed using two markers, one variable number tandem repeat in intron 1 [35] and a CA repeat close to the TP53 gene [36]. Fluorescently end-labeled primers were used in the PCR, and the PCR products were analyzed on an ABI 3700. LOH was evaluated by comparing the allele peak-height ratios from blood DNA and tumor DNA. A sample was scored as having AI (Allelic Imbalance) when a reduction in peak height of one allele in tumor sample was at least 18% compared with that of blood DNA from the same <span class="yellow">patient</span> [37].<br><br>Analysis of p14(ARF) promoter methylation
Genomic DNA was subjected to bisulphate conversion using the CpGenome DNA Modification Kit (Intergen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Both the unmethylated- and methylated-specific PCRs were performed in 50 µl reaction mixes containing 2.5 U AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase (Applied Biosystems), 1× PCR buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 0.2 µM of each primer (Table 1) and 2 µl of modified genomic DNA. Thermocycling conditions for both the unmethylated- and methylated-specific PCRs were an initial step of 5 minutes at 95°C followed by 35 cycles of 30 sec. at 94°C, 30 sec. at 60.5°C and 60 sec. at 72°C before a final elongation step at 72°C for 7 min.<br><br>Chk2 Dimerisation
Chk2 mutant's ability to form dimers with the wild-type protein was investigated by immunoprecipitation. U-2-OS cells were co-transfected with expression vectors expressing wild-type Chk2 with N-terminal Xpr-tag (pcDNA4/HisMax, Invitrogen) and mutated Chk2 forms with C-terminal V5-tag (pcDNA3.1/V5-His, Invitrogen). Transfection was performed using FuGene 6.0 transfection reagent (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested in lysisbuffer (50 mM TrisHCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40, 5 mM EDTA pH 8.0) 48 hours after transfection. An aliquote of the cell lysate was harvested for subsequent Chk2-mutant-V5 transfection verification. Samples were further incubated with A/G Pluss Agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4°C for 25 minutes before the beads were removed by centrifugation at 5000g for 4 minutes and the samples were incubated with 1.5 µg anti-V5 (Invitrogen) at 4°C for 90 minutes. Fresh A/G Pluss Agarose beads were added and the samples were incubated for another 90 minutes at 4°C. The beads were washed three times with 1×PBS, before being separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and blotted on to a nitrocellulose membrane. Chk2-wild-type-Xpr co-precipitated with Chk2-mutant-V5 was detected through incubations with anti-Xpr antibody (Invitrogen), HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL detection reagent (GE Healthcare).<br><br>Kinase Activity
Chk2 mutant's ability to function as kinases was investigated through an in vitro kinase assay. The V5 expression vectors used for the dimerisation study were also used to express Chk2 mutants in the kinase assay. U-2-OS cells were transfected using the FuGene 6.0 transfection reagent (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were then incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 and humidified atmosphere. After 24 hours doxorubicin (Nycomed Pharma) was added to the media to a final concentration of 50ng/ml and the cells were further incubated for 24 hours before harvest. 75 cm2 of 90% confluent cells were harvested in 500 µl lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EDTA), and the cytosol was incubated for 90 minutes at 4°C with 50 µl 50% Glutathione Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) linked to anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen). The beads were then washed twice with lysisbuffer containing 500 mM NaCl and twice with kinase assay buffer (50 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM MnCl2, 2.5 mM EGTA). The beads received 30 µl kinase assay buffer with 7.5 µM cold ATP, 10 µCi 32P-gamma-ATP (GE Healthcare) and 2 µg isolated Cdc25C peptide, and was incubated at 30°C for 30 minutes. Samples were separated on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel and blotted on to a nitrocellulose membrane. A radiosensitive imaging plate was exposed to the membrane and the plate was read in a FLA200 imager (Fuji).
The kinase assay described above was also used to determine the Chk2 mutants' kinase activity after co-transfection of each Chk2 mutant and wild-type Chk2 in equal amounts.<br><br>Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the Primer of Biostatistics system, version 5.0 [38]. The differences in the distribution of TP53 and CHEK2 mutations among <span class="yellow">patients</span> revealing a PD and the responders were analyzed with use of Fisher's exact test. P-values are reported as accumulated two-sided. Because of the limited time of the follow-up, no formal statistical assessment of overall survival was performed. Relapse-free survival was analyzed by the log-rank test. Details regarding outcome in individual <span class="yellow">patients</span> with mutations are shown in Table 2 and 3 to make them available to the reader.<br><br>
Results
TP53 Mutations and Response to Therapy
The TP53 mutations identified in the tumors of the <span class="yellow">patients</span> treated with epirubicin together with the clinical response to therapy and follow-up data are presented in Table 2. Somatic TP53 mutations were identified in 23 (21.5%) of the <span class="yellow">patients</span>. Normal tissue (WBC) was available from 18 of these for germline characterization, revealing none of the mutations identified to be germline alterations. Of the 23 mutations detected, 20 were missense and 3 were nonsense. One mutation (del483CAT) has not been reported previously either in breast cancer or in any other tumor type (IARC database: http://www.iarc.fr/p53/). Twelve of the mutations directly or indirectly affected the L2/L3 domains of the p53 protein (Table 2) previous found to predict a poor prognosis [39] and drug resistance [14], [40]. For statistical comparison, mutation Gly325Ter (<span class="yellow">patient</span> Epi215) located to the tetramerization domain is grouped together with the mutations affecting the L2/L3 domain, since this mutation leads to truncation of the protein and with loss of tetramerization and functional defects similar to L2/L3 mutations [41].
There was a statistical significant correlation between TP53 mutation status and lack of treatment response (PD) (Table 4; p = 0.0358; Fisher exact test). When tumors harboring TP53 mutations affecting the p53 L2/L3 DNA-binding domains were compared to those with wild-type TP53 or TP53 mutations outside the L2/L3 domains, this correlation was further strengthened (p = 0.0136).
The previously described TP53 polymorphism, Arg72Pro [42] was detected in 31 (29%) of our <span class="yellow">patients</span>. No correlation was found between this polymorphism and lack of treatment response (p = 0.2750; Fisher exact test) or TP53 mutational status (p = 0.2024).<br><br>CHEK2 Mutations and Response to Therapy
Table 3 presents the <span class="yellow">patients</span> with detected CHEK2 mutations together with a description of the clinical response and follow up-data. CHEK2 mutations were identified in three out of the 109 <span class="yellow">patients</span> (2.8%). Notably, each of the CHEK2 mutations identified was also present in <span class="yellow">patient</span> lymphocyte DNA, confirming a germline origin. The Arg95Ter (C283T) mutation is novel. This mutation was present in two <span class="yellow">patients</span> (Epi132 and Epi203) living in different parts of Norway with no known family relationship. However, linkage analysis using microsatellite markers (D22S275, D22S272, D22S1172 and D22S423) suggested a common founder mutation (data not shown). The C283T transition generates a novel stop codon in exon 1 of CHEK2, leading to truncation of the Chk2 protein. LOH analysis indicated loss of the wild-type CHEK2 allele in the both tumors from the two <span class="yellow">patients</span> harboring this mutation (Epi132 and Epi203). Both these tumors were non-responsive to epirubicin therapy (PD). In contrast, the third <span class="yellow">patient</span> with a germline CHEK2 mutation (<span class="yellow">patient</span> Epi151; point mutation at T1091C, Ile364Thr) had a partial response to epirubicin therapy. This tumor was non-informative with respect to LOH. Taking all CHEK2 mutations together, they predicted resistance to epirubicin (p = 0.0226).
The previously described silent Glu84Glu (A252G) polymorphism [24], [43] in exon 1 was detected in two (1.9%) <span class="yellow">patients</span>. No association between this polymorphism and treatment response was recorded.
One of the tumors (Epi203) harboring the C283T substitution (Arg95Ter) also harbored a somatic TP53 mutation in codon 175, Arg175His, located in the L2 domain of p53 (Table 2). This mutation was detected in another four of our <span class="yellow">patients</span> treated with epirubicin (Table 2). In addition, TP53 Arg175His mutation was recorded in one <span class="yellow">patient</span> of our previous study evaluating response to doxorubicin [13]. The fact that none of the Arg175His <span class="yellow">patients</span> presented here or in our previous study revealed resistance to therapy (PD) suggests this mutation may not cause resistance to anthracyclines in breast cancers in vivo. Omitting the tumor harboring both a CHEK2 and a TP53 mutation (<span class="yellow">patient</span> Epi203) from statistical analysis, Chk2 mutations (n = 2) were non-significantly associated with therapy resistance (p = 0.1633). In a previous study [26], however, we analyzed for CHEK2 mutation status in relation to therapy outcome in a cohort of <span class="yellow">patients</span> from doxorubicin study [13]. In that study [26], we detected the previously identified mutation Ile157Thr. In addition, we detected a novel nonsense somatic mutation (1368InsA). This mutation was associated with lack of function in vitro; moreover, it was associated with drug resistance in vivo. Analyzing our material and this cohort [26] together, (n = 160), CHEK2 mutations (n = 5 in total) predicted for resistance to doxorubicin and epirubicin therapy (p = 0.0123). Even though, excluding <span class="yellow">patient</span> Epi203 (harboring TP53 Arg175His and Arg95Ter CHEK2 mutation) as well as other <span class="yellow">patients</span> harboring TP53 L2/L3 mutations (n = 129), CHEK2 mutations (n = 4 in total) predicted for resistance to doxorubicin and epirubicin therapy (p = 0.030).<br><br>TP53 and CHEK2 Mutations Combined and Response to Therapy
Assuming that TP53 and CHEK2 mutations may substitute for each other, we analyzed for the predictive effect of mutations in both genes. The occurrence of a mutation affecting either CHEK2 or TP53 strongly predicted therapy resistance (p = 0.0101; Fisher exact test). When tumors harboring TP53-L2/L3 mutations and CHEK2 mutations were compared with those wild-type or TP53 mutations outside the L2/L3 domain, the correlation was further strengthened (p = 0.0032; Fisher exact test). The significance was preserved when comparing <span class="yellow">patients</span> with a PD to objective responders (CR and PR) excluding <span class="yellow">patients</span> with stable disease (SD) from the statistical analysis (Table 4).<br><br>p14(ARF) Mutations and Promoter Methylations
Neither mutations nor polymorphisms in the coding region of p14(ARF) were observed among the 107 <span class="yellow">patients</span> analyzed. Likewise, no promoter methylations were detected.<br><br>Influence of CHEK2 and TP53 Mutation Status on Relapse-Free Survival
Because of the limited time of the follow-up, no formal statistical assessment of overall survival was performed. Details regarding outcome for individual <span class="yellow">patients</span> with mutations are described in Table 2 and 3 to make these data available to the reader. Relapse-free survival is depicted in (Figure 1). Figure 1A shows relapse-free survival for the <span class="yellow">patients</span> with TP53 and CHEK2 mutations (all mutations found) compared to <span class="yellow">patients</span> without any TP53 or CHEK2 mutations, no difference in relapse-free survival was observed. Similar, no difference was seen when grouping TP53 mutations outside L2/L3 and CHEK2 mutation not affecting kinase function (Ile364Thr) as wild-type (Figure 1B). Grouping tumors harboring a mutation in L2/L3 together with CHEK2 mutations affecting kinase domain (Arg95Ter) in one group, mutations outside TP53 L2/L3 and Ile364Thr as one group and tumors without any found mutations in TP53 and CHEK2 separately, again no noticeably difference in relapse-free survival were seen (Figure 1C). Notably, in addition to a short median follow-up time, a total of 35 <span class="yellow">patients</span> with a sub-optimal response to epirubicin received subsequent treatment with paclitaxel, which may have influenced the outcome.<br><br>CHEK2 Mutant's Capability to Form Dimers
To investigate whether the identified CHEK2 mutations affect the ability of the Chk2 protein to form dimers, co-transfection and immunopresipitation of V5-tagged mutants and Xpress-tagged wild-type Chk2 were performed using CHEK2 low-expressing U-2-OS cells. As we identified the previously characterized CHEK2 germline mutants variants Arg117His (n = 2 and Ile157Thr (n = 1) among <span class="yellow">patients</span> allocated to primary treatment with paclitaxel in our ongoing study, these mutants were evaluated together with Arg95Ter and Ile364Thr. The results presented in Figure 2 show that all Chk2 variants carrying a point mutation were able to form dimers with wild-type Chk2, whereas the Arg95Ter variant was not.<br><br>Kinase Activity of CHEK2 Mutants
To investigate whether the identified CHEK2 mutants retained the wild-type kinase activity, an in vitro Chk2 kinase assay with respect to Chk2 autophosphorylation and Cdc25 substrate phosphorylation was performed. The U-2-OS cells were preferred for this assay because they were previously found to express only low levels of endogenous Chk2 [44]. This was confirmed by us using an antibody recognizing endogenous protein (data not shown). These cells have previously been used by other investigators to study Chk2 kinase activity [44], [45], [46].
The two mutants Arg117Gly and Ile157Thr were previously tested for in vitro kinase activity [47], but were both included here, together with wild-type CHEK2 as controls. Compared to wild-type Chk2, the Ile157Thr mutant retained wild-type kinase activity. The mutant Ile364Thr showed partially reduced kinase activity both in term of Cdc25-phosphorylation and autophosphorylation (Figure 3). In contrast, the mutant Arg117Gly showed strongly reduced kinase activity while the Arg95Ter mutant was totally devoid of any Chk2 kinase activity. The activity recorded for Ile157Thr and Arg117Gly was consistent with previously reported results for these two mutants [47]. Notably, there was an internal consistency with respect to percentage activity reduction comparing individual mutants with respect to autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of Cdc25 (Figure 3).
Since enzymatically active Chk2 exists as dimers, it was important to determine the effect of Chk2 mutants on wild-type/mutant heterodimer kinase activity. The effect on Chk2 kinase activities (Chk2 autophosphorylation and Cdc25 substrate phosphorylation) of the individual mutants were therefore determined after co-transfection with wild-type Chk2 as described in Materials and Methods. The results from this co-transfection-kinase assay (Figure 4) were similar to those of the single-transfection assay (Figure 3) except in the case of the Arg117Gly mutant, which expressed a substantial kinase activity when complexed with wild-type Chk2. This is consistent with previous data indicating that the Arg117Gly mutant has neglectable kinase activity itself but dimerizes efficiently to Chk2 wild-type without strongly affecting the wild-type Chk2 activity. Hence, the activity detected is probably caused by the co-transfected and co-precipitated wild-type protein.
To rule out the possibility that endogenously expressed wild-type Chk2 contributed to observed Arg117Gly kinase activity shown in Figure 4, we compared the Arg117Gly variant activity in the presence or absence of co-transfected wild-type Chk2 to the activities of Arg95Ter under the same conditions. The Arg95Ter variant does not form dimers with wild-type Chk2. As seen in Figure 5, Arg117Gly, which forms dimers with Chk2 wild-type, allows increased activity when co-transfected with wild-type as compared to the corresponding activity for the Arg95Ter mutant. The fact that Arg117Gly, when transfected alone, displays very similar activity as Arg95Ter or negative control (background levels), strongly indicates that the contribution of endogenous Chk2, which, similarly to exogenously expressed wild-type Chk2 co-precipitate with Arg117Gly is non-significant.<br><br>Family Cancer Incidence in Relation to CHEK2 Germline Mutations
Following an initial report of a family with a CHEK2 germline mutation expressing an increased cancer incidence resembling the Li-Fraumeni syndrome [24], recent studies have revealed the more common CHEK2 mutations to be associated with a moderately increased risk of breast and colorectal cancers. We hypothesized that CHEK2 mutations having a detrimental effect on drug sensitivity could be associated with a more aggressive, Li-Fraumeni or a Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) cancer syndrome [48]. Except from the <span class="yellow">patient</span> harboring the Ile364Thr mutation who did not have any known congestion of cancer disease in the family, a detailed assessment of family cancer history was performed for each <span class="yellow">patient</span> harboring a germline CHEK2 mutation. The family cancer pedigrees are depicted in Figure 6.
While <span class="yellow">patients</span> harboring CHEK2 germline mutations revealed different types of cancers (mainly breast and tumors of the gastrointestinal area) in their family, surprisingly, no distinct pattern discriminating families harboring the Arg95Ter mutation from the other CHEK2 mutated families could be identified. One of them (Epi203), who inherited the mutation from her father's side of the family, had no accumulation of either breast or colorectal cancer on that side. It should be noted, however, that two brothers of her fathers mother had prostate cancer, and two siblings of his father having hepatocellular carcinoma and bladder cancer, respectively), while the other expressed a disease pattern resembling what has been seen with the more common CHEK2 mutations, like del1100C [25].<br><br>
Discussion
TP53 plays a key role as a tumor suppressor gene. Its protein product activates processes such as growth arrest, DNA repair, apoptosis and/or senescence in response to genotoxic damage as well as oncogene activity [49], [50]. Despite being extensively studied, critical issues regarding regulation of the p53 protein remain poorly understood, and conflicting evidence obtained in different experimental systems make the clinical relevance of experimental data questionable.
Chemoresistance is the main obstacle to cancer cure in most malignancies, including breast cancer. Previously, we found TP53 mutations affecting the L2/L3 DNA binding domain to be associated with lack of responsiveness to doxorubicin monotherapy [13] as well as mitomycin and 5-fluoro-uracil in concert [14]. However, some tumors revealed therapy resistance despite harboring wild-type TP53. Postulating that these tumors may harbor genetic disturbances in genes playing a key role in the p53 pathway, we here sequenced TP53 along with CHEK2 and p14(ARF), the latter two known to play a critical role as p53 activators, in tumors from 109 <span class="yellow">patients</span> treated with epirubicin monotherapy. Our results confirm TP53 mutations, in particular those affecting the L2/L3 domains, to be associated with drug resistance. Most importantly, we also found CHEK2 mutations generating a non-functional protein in our in vitro assays to be associated with drug resistance. In contrast, none of our tumors harbored either mutations or expressed promoter hypermethylations affecting the p14.
Based on in vitro assays, we were able to classify the different Chk2 mutants with respect to dimerization capability as well as kinase activity (Chk2 autophosphorylation and Cdc25 substrate phosphorylation). In addition, the kinase activities of the Chk2 wild-type/mutant complexes were monitored in co-transfection experiments. Notably, each point mutation (except for Arg117Gly) revealed similar relative kinase efficacy whether co-transfected with wild-type Chk2 or not (Figure 3 and 4). Cells co-transfected with Arg117Gly and wild-type Chk2 revealed kinase activity, probably due to the contribution of the wild type protein in Chk2 mutant – wild-type heterodimers. In contrast, cells transfected with Arg95Ter revealed no kinase activity whether co-transfected with wild-type Chk2 or not, clearly distinguishing this mutation from the others (Figure 3 and 5).
All in vitro assays were based on transfection of the U-2-OS cell line, a cell line known to express wild-type Chk2 at low levels, and previously used by other investigators to study Chk2 activity [44], [45], [46]. Since we were not able to obtain satisfactory technical quality of the kinase assay in cell lines negative for Chk2 (HCT 15 and HCT 116), we assessed potential background kinase activity due to endogenous Chk2 by performing western blot analysis revealing the endogenous levels of Chk2 in U-2-OS cells to be non-significant compared to the exogenously expressed Chk2 levels (data not shown). We also performed a separate kinase assay, directly comparing the effect of binding partners for the dimerizing Arg117Gly and the non-dimerizing Arg95Ter. This assay also revealed the contribution of endogenous Chk2 to be non-significant (Figure 5).
Taking our in vitro findings together with in vivo observations, our present data confirm that the functionally defective CHEK2 Arg95Ter mutation, together with LOH, is associated with resistance to anthracycline therapy. In contrast, the <span class="yellow">patient</span> harboring the Ile364Thr mutation, moderately reducing phosphorylation activity, responded well to therapy. The other missense mutations; Arg117Gly and Ile157Thr were observed among <span class="yellow">patients</span> receiving paclitaxel therapy only; thus, their influence on anthracycline sensitivity in vivo could not be addressed. Yet, based on the finding that the Arg117Gly mutant expressed no intrinsic activity, but readily dimerized to the wild-type protein without abolishing its activity, we hypothesize that this mutation and, probably, other yet unidentified CHEK2 mutations with a similar lack of intrinsic kinase activity, may cause resistance to anthracycline therapy if combined with LOH in breast cancer.
Our present findings have two major implications. First, we confirm that mutations in genes encoding proteins located within the same functional pathway may substitute for each other with respect to drug sensitivity, revealing for the first time a functional pathway critical to chemotherapy response in vivo. Second, the identification of mutations in the CHEK2 but not in the p14(ARF) gene in resistant tumors suggests that Chk2 mediated phosphorylation of p53 is a critical event in executing anti-tumor effect as a response to DNA damaging agents in breast cancer. This adds to our understanding not only of the function of p53 but Chk2 as well. p53 undergoes phosphorylation at multiple sites by different kinases, including Chk2 [51]. While activation of the ATM leading to direct (Ser 15) and Chk2-mediated (Ser 20) phosphorylation of p53 is considered an important mechanism for triggering p53 activation in response to DNA damage [52], some reports suggest ATM [53] and even Chk2 [23] to be redundant to this function. Importantly, Chk2 has been shown capable of inducing ATM-independent apoptosis in vitro [21]. While Chk2 phosphorylates p53 at Ser 20, thereby stabilizing p53 by preventing MDM2 binding [19], Chk2 also phosphorylates p53 at six additional sites, including Ser 313 and Ser 314 located in the nuclear localization signal domain of p53 [51]. In addition, Chk2 phosphorylates other important targets like BRCA1, Cdc25A and Cdc25C involved in DNA repair, G1 and G2 arrest, respectively [54]. Despite the wide range of known Chk2 substrates relevant for DNA repair and cell cycle control, our present findings that CHEK2 mutations leading to non-functional Chk2 protein may substitute for p53 mutations strongly advocate a role for Chk2 with respect to drug sensitivity executed through p53 activation.
Notably, one of the tumors (Epi203) with the Arg95Ter CHEK2 mutation in addition harbored a somatic TP53 mutation, Arg175His, with allelic imbalance for the TP53 gene (Table 2). Importantly, among another four <span class="yellow">patients</span> in this study (Epi063, Epi071, Epi087, Epi153) and one <span class="yellow">patient</span> from our previous doxorubicin protocol [13] harboring the Arg175His mutation together with allelic imbalance for TP53, all five of these <span class="yellow">patients</span> responded to anthracycline therapy either with a partial response or stable disease. In contrast, Epi132 and the only <span class="yellow">patient</span> for whom we previously identified a non-functional CHEK2 mutation (1368InsA; coding for a non-functional protein translate with cytoplasmic location [26]) expressed resistance to epirubicin and doxorubicin, respectively. Arg175His is a p53 “hot-spot” structural mutation reported to have defects with respect to transcriptional activation and also to negatively interact with wild-type p53 [55]. While this mutation has been shown to enhance chemoresistance upon transfection into p53 null Saos-2 cells [56], these osteosarcoma-derived cells may not necessarily be representative for breast cancers in vivo. Recent evidence strongly support p53 to be involved also in non-transcriptional mediated apoptosis by interacting with the Bcl-2/Bax system [57], and transcription-defect structural p53 mutants have been shown to execute non-transcriptional apoptosis in experimental systems [58]. Concomitant inactivation of Chk2 and p53 in breast cancer has been recorded by others [59], and the finding that a somatic mutation may generate a “growth advantage” in tumor cells already harboring a germline CHEK2 mutation may not implicate an effect on drug sensitivity in tumors not yet exposed to cytotoxic compounds. Rather, it may indicate a growth advantage, probably related to loss of p21 function. Notably, in a previous study we found the p21 polymorphism G251A to be associated with an increased risk of developing large breast cancers but to have no effect on drug sensitivity [60], indicating that growth rate and drug resistance may be regulated independently. Taken together, we believe our findings advocate a role for Chk2 in executing cellular response to anthracycline-induced DNA damage.
As mentioned above, removing TP53 mutated tumors including the double-mutated Epi203 from statistical analysis, CHEK2 mutation status still predicted for resistance to anthracycline therapy. In addition, removing the tumors harboring the Arg175His mutation from the p53 “L2/L3” group strengthened the correlation to lack of treatment response to epirubicin (p = 0.0005).
Comparing the effects of mutations in the CHEK2 gene to TP53 mutations indirectly underlines the importance of the role of Chk2 to chemoresistance. Our present findings as well as results from our previous studies [13], [14] revealed that about 50% of the <span class="yellow">patients</span> with tumors harboring TP53 L2/L3 mutations to be non-responders to primary therapy. In contrast, all our three <span class="yellow">patients</span> harboring a non-functional CHEK2 mutation (the two Arg95Ter mutated <span class="yellow">patients</span> here and our previous <span class="yellow">patient</span> harboring the 1368InsA) expressed primary resistance to therapy. We previously hypothesized that therapy response in tumors harboring TP53 L2/L3 mutations could be due to redundant pathways acting in concert [3]. Although no definite conclusion should be drawn from a limited number of observation, the fact that Chk2 not only phosphorylates p53 but also phosphorylates other substrates such as Cdc25A and Cdc25C [54] and E2F1 in response to etoposide-induced DNA damage [61] may indicate that inactivation of redundant pathways could take place in parallel.
The literature remains inconsistent with respect to whether the border amino acids 163, 195, 236 and 251 should be included in the p53 L2 and L3 domains [12]. Taking a conservative approach, we classified <span class="yellow">patient</span> Epi56, harboring a mutation in codon 163, as a L2/L3 mutant. The <span class="yellow">patient</span> harboring this mutation responded to therapy (PR). If this mutation was classified as outside the L2 domain, our p-value had been strengthened from p = 0.0136 to p = 0.0096.
Germline mutations in TP53 cause the Li-Fraumeni and Li-Fraumeni-like cancer disposition syndromes. However, while the germline and somatic mutations associated with these syndromes reveal a preference for the same codons [48], TP53 mutations affecting the DNA-binding domains seem associated with a poor prognosis [62], [63], [64] and, in particular, drug resistance [14], [40] in breast cancer. Thus, tumor suppression and tumor cell response to chemotherapeutics may involve different parts of p53 protein function. Following an initial report identifying a CHEK2 mutation in a family expressing characteristics of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome [65], recent evidence has linked CHEK2 founder mutations to a moderately increased risk of breast- and colorectal cancers with some additional disposition for other malignancies as well [66]. However, cancer incidence and phenotypes did not reveal an aggressive Li-Fraumeni or Li-Fraumeni-like tumor pattern. Similar to the two <span class="yellow">patients</span> in our paclitaxel treatment arm harboring the rare but previously characterized mutation Arg117Gly and the <span class="yellow">patient</span> with the Ile157Thr mutation, they expressed a moderately increased risk of breast and gastrointestinal cancers (Fig. 6). Thus, CHEK2 resembles TP53 in as much as there seems to be no direct correlation between effects of individual mutations with respect to tumor suppression and drug resistance.
Our finding that TP53 mutations located to the DNA-binding domains predicts drug resistance may indicate transcriptional mechanisms to be involved in drug-induced cell death. p53 induced apoptosis has been associated with transcriptional induction of genes including Puma and Noxa as well as Bax in experimental systems [55], [67], [68]. Yet, recent evidence has revealed p53 to induce apoptosis through non-transcriptional mechanisms by direct protein interactions with members of the Bcl-2/Bax system and mitochondrial release of cytochrom c [57], [69]. In deed, there is evidence that the DNA-binding domains, in particular the L3 part of the protein, may be critical also to transcriptional-independent apoptosis [70]. Of particular note is the finding that Chk2 may regulate transcriptional-independent p53-mediated apoptosis in response to DNA-damage created through ionizing irradiation [71]. Interestingly, Krajewski et al [72] reported low expression of Bax assessed by immunostaining to be associated with a low response to chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer. Although no conclusion should be drawn at this stage, together these findings are consistent with the challenging hypothesis that transcription-independent activation of Bax following Chk2-phosphorylation may represent a key pathway in p53 dependent cell death in breast cancer in vivo.
p14 acts by releasing p53 from MDM2 binding, and has been related to oncogene-induced p53 activation [73]. Recently, p14 was shown to affect p53 by additional mechanisms, including acetylations [74], response to ionizing radiation in <span class="yellow">human</span> fibroblasts [75], and tumor-suppression following ionizing radiation in <span class="blue">mice</span> [76], [77]. These findings further links the retinoblastoma and p53 pathways [28]. As such, we believe the negative finding with respect to its role in chemoresistance adds important information.
Contrasting earlier findings by us and others [15], a recent study revealed TP53 mutations to be associated with increased likelihood of having a complete response to chemotherapy [16]. These results may not necessarily be at conflict. In the latter study, <span class="yellow">patients</span> received treatment with a “dose-dense” chemotherapy regimen; if confirmed, the combined data may outline a therapeutic indication for aggressive dose-dense therapy based on tumor TP53/CHEK2 status.
So far attempts to identify single markers and, more recently, gene expression arrays predicting chemoresistance have not proved successful (see refs in [9], [10]). The findings presented here reveal for the first time defects in a functional gene cascade to be associated with drug resistance in a <span class="yellow">human</span> cancer in vivo. Moreover, the findings are made in breast cancer, the most frequent malignant disease among <span class="yellow">women</span> in the industrialized world, and relate to resistance to anthracyclines, the type of cytotoxic compounds most frequently employed for this malignancy.
While the only study we are aware of comparing TP53 mutation status in primaries and their distant metastases suggested an increasing fraction of tumors to express mutated TP53 during progression [78], we do not know the potential contribution of either TP53 or CHEK2 mutations to drug resistance in micrometastases or in metastatic disease. Yet the finding that one of our non-functional CHEK2 mutations associated with chemoresistance (1368InsA) occurred as a somatic, not germline mutation, suggest such mutations may be selected for during tumor progression. We propose the findings presented here provide important beacons identifying a functional pathway [3] likely to be disturbed through different mechanisms in relation to therapy resistance in advanced disease.
In conclusion, we believe our findings here that mutations in the TP53 and CHEK2 genes each may cause resistance to anthracycline therapy in primary tumors to have wide implications to future research in this area. While results from experimental systems are mandatory generating hypotheses, conflicting data from in vitro studies underlines the pivotal role of identifying defects associated with therapy resistance in vivo. Either through mutations of the genes themselves, or inactivation of this functional cascade through co-factors, we believe identification of the Chk2 – p53 axis as critical to anthracycline therapy response provides a functional clue for further investigations in this area.<br><br>
<h3>pmcA2562362</h3>Host immunity in the protective response to vaccination with heat-killed <span class="yellow">Burkholderia mallei</span>
Abstract
Background
We performed initial cell, cytokine and complement depletion studies to investigate the possible role of these effectors in response to vaccination with heat-killed <span class="yellow">Burkholderia mallei</span> in a susceptible BALB/c <span class="yellow">mouse</span> model of infection.<br><br>Results
While protection with heat-killed bacilli did not result in sterilizing immunity, limited protection was afforded against an otherwise lethal infection and provided insight into potential host protective mechanisms. Our results demonstrated that <span class="blue">mice</span> depleted of either B cells, TNF-α or IFN-γ exhibited decreased survival rates, indicating a role for these effectors in obtaining partial protection from a lethal challenge by the intraperitoneal route. Additionally, complement depletion had no effect on immunoglobulin production when compared to non-complement depleted controls infected intranasally.<br><br>Conclusion
The data provide a basis for future studies of protection via vaccination using either subunit or whole-organism vaccine preparations from lethal infection in the experimental BALB/c <span class="yellow">mouse</span> model. The results of this study demonstrate participation of B220+ cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α in protection following HK vaccination.<br><br><br><br>Background
<span class="yellow">Burkholderia mallei</span>, the etiologic agent of glanders, is a gram-negative, capsulated, non-motile, facultative intracelluar bacterium. Most known members of the Burkholderiaceae are resident in the soil; however, <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> is thought to be an obligate mammalian pathogen. <span class="yellow">Horses</span> are highly susceptible to infection and considered the natural reservoir for infection, although <span class="yellow">mules</span> and <span class="yellow">donkeys</span> are also susceptible [1]. Clinically, glanders in solipeds can present as either a chronic (<span class="yellow">horses</span>) or acute (<span class="yellow">mules</span> and <span class="yellow">donkeys</span>) form. Naturally acquired <span class="yellow">human</span> infection with <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span>, although not seen in the United States since 1945, has occurred rarely and sporadically among laboratory workers and those in direct contact with infected animals [2]. However, glanders is endemic among domestic animals in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Central and South America. The course of infection is dependent on the route of exposure. Direct contact with the skin can lead to a systemic infection. Inhalation of aerosol or dust containing <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> can lead to septicemic, pulmonary, or chronic infections of the muscle, liver and spleen. The disease has a 95% case fatality rate for untreated septicemic infections and a 50% case fatality rate in antibiotic-treated individuals [3].
There is no <span class="yellow">human</span> or animal vaccine available for glanders, and development of a partial or fully protective adaptive host response to the organism has not been well-defined. Previous studies with <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> and the host response have shown that a mixed immune response consisting of both Th1 and Th2-associated cytokines with a predominant IgG1 subclass does not correlate with protection [4]. Additional studies with passive transfer of monoclonal antibodies specific for <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> have correlated with early protection from infection [5]. Recent studies have also shown the Th1 cytokine IL-12 to mediate partial protection to non-viable <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span>-vaccinated <span class="blue">mice</span> [6]. Thus, full correlates of protection mediated by the adaptive immune system against <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> remain to be fully elucidated.
In this series of studies, we sought to address the impact of depletion of the major effector lymphoid cell populations (B220+ B cells, CD4+ or CD8+ T cells) and key pro-inflammatory/Type 1 cytokines (IFN-γ or TNF-α) on survival in BALB/c <span class="blue">mice</span> vaccinated with heat killed (HK) bacilli followed by an intraperitoneal (i.p.) challenge with live organism. In addition, studies investigating the effect of complement on opsonization of organism and antibody production were assessed. Heat killed bacteria were used as a model of vaccination to allow evaluation of <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> specific immune responses. The results of this study demonstrate participation of B220+ cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α in protection following HK vaccination.<br><br>Results
Heat-killed <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> vaccination mediates partial protection from lethal challenge
To begin to address this issue in an animal model of acute infection, we established that immunologically naive BALB/c <span class="blue">mice</span> challenged i.p. with 2 × 107 CFU resulted in death by day 4–6, while i.p. immunization with 1 × 105 heat killed (HK) bacteria provided partial protection against a subsequent challenge. Two independent experiments resulted in similar findings of 40% survival for HK-vaccinated <span class="blue">mice</span> with a mean survival time (MST) of 8 days versus 4 days in naïve <span class="blue">mice</span> (Fig. 1). The administration of vaccines for <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> during an outbreak would mandate relatively rapid onset of protection for <span class="yellow">human</span> or veterinary use. Based on non-routine use and vaccine implementation in the course of an outbreak, a 14 day window was chosen for assessment of protection. Our results indicate that HK vaccination can afford partial protection to an otherwise lethal challenge of <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> by the i.p. route.<br><br>Effects of cell depletion on HK-vaccinated survival
To dissect the cellular basis for protection mediated by HK vaccination, 13 days after immunization with HK bacteria (day -1), and at day of challenge, <span class="blue">mice</span> were dosed with antibodies to deplete CD4+, CD8+ or B220+ cells. Antibody depletion of CD4+, CD8+, or B220+ cells in these <span class="blue">mice</span> was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis with depletion efficiencies for CD4, CD8, and B220 populations at 99.7%, 96%, and 95%, respectively, relative to <span class="blue">mice</span> treated with isotype control monoclonal antibodies (data not shown). Our results demonstrated decreased survival rates in B220 (p = 0.3418), CD4+ (p = 0.5417) and CD8+ (p = 0.4684) antibody depleted <span class="blue">mice</span>, compared to isotype control antibody, a finding that indicated a possible role for vaccine induced antibody production. When challenged with 2 × 107 CFU/<span class="yellow">mouse</span> by the i.p. route, loss of T cells resulted in reduced survival (50%) relative to the non-specific isotype control (Fig. 2). In contrast to the loss of T cells, depletion of B220+ cells resulted in 100% mortality relative to the non-specific isotype control (Fig. 2). To further evaluate the necessity of these effector cells in providing protection following HK vaccination, relatively resistant C57BL/6 <span class="blue">mice</span>, deficient in mature B-cells (μMT), CD4 T-cells (CD4-/-) or CD8 T-cells (CD8-/-) were subjected to an identical HK vaccination and challenge regimen. Mature, B-cell-deficient <span class="blue">mice</span> demonstrated a 50% decreased survival (p = 0.0888) compared to the wild-type <span class="blue">mice</span> with an MST of 35.5 days (Fig. 3). CD4-/- and CD8-/- <span class="blue">mice</span> exhibited a 60% (p = 0.1343) and 0% reduced survival, respectively (Fig. 3).<br><br>Effects of cytokine depletion on HK vaccination
Similar studies were performed to determine the role of IFN-γ or TNF-α in acute infection in BALB/c <span class="blue">mice</span> immunized with HK bacteria. Six hours before challenge, <span class="blue">mice</span> were dosed with antibodies that neutralize IFN-γ or TNF-α. Individual depletion of either TNF-α (p = 0.0145) or IFN-γ (p = 0.0446) resulted in 100% mortality with an MST of 3 and 2 days, respectively, compared to the HK-vaccinated isotype control <span class="blue">mice</span> (Fig. 4). In contrast, 40% of HK-vaccinated, isotype control <span class="blue">mice</span> survived to at least 12 days post-challenge (Fig 4). To further evaluate the host TNF-α response during an established <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> chronic infection, we infected 12 BALB/c <span class="blue">mice</span> by the i.p. route with 1 × 106 CFU <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span>. One animal was terminally ill on day 37 post-infection. On day 42 post-infection, the remaining 11 <span class="blue">mice</span> were dosed with either anti-TNF-α (n = 6), or control mAb (AFRC Mac 49) (n = 5). No further deaths were observed in the control mAb-treated <span class="blue">mice</span>. Rapid mortality was observed in the anti-TNF-α-treated group, with all <span class="blue">mice</span> dying within 7 days of treatment (p = 0.0023) relative to the isotype-treated controls (Fig. 5).<br><br>J774A.1 uptake of serum treated <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span>
Complement mediated uptake assays were performed to evaluate opsonization. Results indicated enhanced bacterial uptake in J774A.1 phagocytes inoculated with serum treated <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> (p = .0082), compared to <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> alone, while heat-inactivated serum produced uptake percentages similar to those prior to serum addition (Fig. 6). Taken together, these results imply an active role for complement components in the uptake of organism by macrophages.<br><br>Immunoglobulin production in HK vaccinated BALB/c <span class="blue">mice</span>
We further characterized the ability of HK vaccination to induce a predominant IgG isotype by determining IgG2a/IgG1 ratios in i.p. and i.n. vaccinated BALB/c <span class="blue">mice</span>. Pre (day 14 post vaccination) and post (day 2 post infection) exposure serum samples were obtained and evaluated for IgG isotype concentrations (Table 1). No appreciable differences in IgG pre-exposure levels were seen when comparing i.n. to i.p. vaccination. In addition, cobra venom factor-treated animals showed no significant differences to non-cobra venom factor-treated animals in IgG pre-exposure (challenge) levels. Conversely, isotype switching in the cobra venom factor treated animals was enhanced in post-exposure serum IgG2a (Table 1).<br><br>
Discussion
Recent studies have shown a key role in protection from lethal challenge for IFN-γ in non-vaccinated <span class="blue">mice</span> from either NK and/or NKT cells following experimental exposure to <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> and <span class="yellow">B. pseudomallei</span> [7,8]. A similar protective role in the innate response to infection has been demonstrated for TNF-α in <span class="yellow">B. pseudomallei</span> infection [8]. The studies presented here are consistent with the essential role of these factors in the relative levels of protection conferred by vaccination with heat-killed <span class="yellow">B. pseudomallei</span> and would appear to be viable early markers for protection from lethal acute infection [9]. Currently, there are no fully protective vaccines against <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> or <span class="yellow">B. pseudomallei</span> in a <span class="yellow">murine</span> model, particularly for the sensitive BALB/c versus C57BL6 models. Previous studies have also demonstrated that both the humoral and cell-mediated arms are essential for protection from <span class="yellow">B. pseudomallei</span> infection [10]. Thus, loss or reduction of TNF-α and IFN-γ levels result in significantly reduced survival rates, substantiating previous reports of the role of these factors in protection against <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> [7]. Moreover, we demonstrate a role for sustained TNF-α production in the maintenance of host survival throughout the course of <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> infection. <span class="yellow">Mice</span> with an established <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> chronic infection rapidly lost the ability to control the growth of the bacillus upon neutralization of TNF-α. This would suggest a potential role for TNF-α in the maintenance of productive granulomas which may limit the spread of bacteria in chronically infected hosts, or, alternatively, in direct or indirect microbicidal or bacteriostatic activities at the sites of infection. Additional studies are underway to determine more precisely the role of TNF-α in host protection to <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span>.
Multiple innate and adaptive cell types may contribute to the production of IFN-γ in response to infection with <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> following vaccination. Our results with individual depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells suggests that both cell types may compensate for the functional loss of the other effector cell type in the production of this key cytokine. The effector role for IFN-γ in mediating protection against <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> may include both immunoregulatory and non-regulatory functions. Regardless, the requirement of IFN-γ, as demonstrated by administration of neutralizing antibody prior to infection, indicates that stimulation of IFN-γ response is a desirable goal for a <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> vaccine.
Similarly, B220-positive cells appear to play a role in protection following vaccination with heat-killed <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span>. Interestingly, this protective immunity, occurring in other intracellular pathogens, is not exclusively dependent on B cells [11]. Passive protection has been demonstrated against acute Burkholderia infection by monoclonal antibodies [5,12]. Protection against <span class="yellow">B. pseudomallei</span> infection by anti-LPS, capsular polysaccharide and proteins has been short-lived, suggesting that antibody production offers limited protection in the initial stages of infection by an as-yet-undefined mechanism [12]. We have shown that following depletion of B220+ cells, survival rates decreased as much as 100% relative to non-depleted controls and individual CD4/CD8-depleted <span class="blue">mice</span> via the intraperitoneal route. Results from C57BL/6 <span class="blue">mice</span> deficient in mature B-cells (μMT), CD4 T-cells (CD4-/-) or CD8 T-cells (CD8-/-) substantiate the requirement for B-cell involvement by evidence of μMT and CD4-/- decreased survival. The lack of an effective CTL response to vaccination did not appear to alter survival in what would appear to be a CD4/B-cell (humoral)-driven response. In CD4-deficient <span class="blue">mice</span>, we have the additional potential variable that a CD4-dependent antibody response might also be inhibited during the vaccination phase relative to <span class="blue">mice</span> treated with antibody immediately prior to and during the early phases of infection. Although not statistically significant, we did observe a decrease in survival in μMT (mature B cell) deficient <span class="blue">mice</span> as early as day 9 post challenge, whereas CD4-deficient <span class="blue">mice</span> produced similar results at day 32 post challenge, indicating a role for B cells independent of CD4 T cell help, perhaps through a T-independent mechanism of antibody production. Although CD8-/- C57BL/6 demonstrated no decreased survival in our HK-vaccinated model, a lack of potential endogenous protein production by HK <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> may have contributed to limited MHC-I presentation.
Complement associated studies revealed increased J774A.1 uptake of serum-treated <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span>. Complement-mediated uptake studies of <span class="yellow">B. pseudomallei</span> by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) suggest that capsule production contributes to resistance of phagocytosis by reducing C3b bacterial deposition [13]. Previous studies have demonstrated that a polysaccharide capsule is present in <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span>, [14,15] although in the present study enhanced uptake with serum-treated <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> was observed. Intracellular survival assays of complement mediated uptake of organisms were not performed in the present study, thus, the role of complement opsonization on intracellular survival is not fully resolved. Previous reports have demonstrated the ability of <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> to survive within macrophage without the aid of serum coating organisms [16]. Conversely, the idea of antibody mediated opsonization to facilitate macrophage activation and clearance of intracellular organisms may offer support to the role of B cells in an effective immune response. A possible protective mechanism may include HK vaccination induced production of opsonizing antibodies which may aid in complement mediated uptake, thereby limiting the initial bacterial threshold below a lethal level.
Immunoglobulin responses to HK vaccination resulted in modest levels of IgG1 following 2 weeks post vaccination, while post-exposure levels were indicative of efficient class switching to a favorable IgG2a isotype. Importantly, cobra venom factor treatment of animals at time of vaccination did not alter their ability to produce immunoglobulin. In fact, cobra venom factor treated animals resulted in higher IgG2a levels when compared to non-treated. Complement activation can modulate both the primary and secondary immune responses and has been shown to enhance secondary immune responses to vaccination [17]. The current results suggest that cobra venom factor treatment may affect the modulation of the immune response to <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> infection through B cell activation and/or memory B cell generation.<br><br>Conclusion
In summary, our results provide a basis for future studies of protection via vaccination using either subunit or whole-organism vaccine preparations from lethal infection in the experimental BALB/c <span class="yellow">mouse</span> model. Understanding and defining the role of B cells in adaptive <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> immunity will likely be fundamental to the design of an efficacious vaccine and important goals of future research.<br><br>Methods
Bacterial strain and <span class="blue">mice</span>
<span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> strain ATCC 23344 (China 7) was cultured on Luria-Bertani agar supplemented with 4% glycerol (LB+4%G) agar plates for 48 h at 37°C. Isolated colonies were sub-cultured to LB+4%G broth, and cultures were incubated at 37°C until optical density readings at 600 nm (OD600) reached an exponential phase of growth. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation, washed and re-suspended in sterile 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) to obtain the desired CFU/ml. To obtain HK inoculums, bacterial suspensions were incubated at 85°C for 3 h and stored at 4°C until use. The absence of live <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> organisms in the HK preparations was confirmed after plating 10% of the total inoculums (v/v) and incubating these at 37°C for 48 h. All procedures were performed under a class II biosafety cabinet in a biosafety level 3 laboratory. Female, 6- to 8-week-old, BALB/c <span class="blue">mice</span> (n = 5–7) were obtained from Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc. (Indianapolis, Indiana). Female, 6- to 8-week-old, C57BL/6 <span class="blue">mice</span> deficient in mature B-cells (μMT), CD4 T-cells (CD4-/-) and CD8 T-cells (CD8-/-) and wild-type <span class="blue">mice</span> were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine).<br><br>Vaccination and challenge
BALB/c and C57BL/6 <span class="blue">mice</span> were grouped and vaccinated with 0.5 μg of HK <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> (without adjuvant) by i.p. injection using a 25-gauge syringe. Two weeks post HK vaccination <span class="blue">mice</span> were injected i.p. with 2 × 107 CFU/100 μl of live <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> (~20 LD50) [18]. Complement depleted animals were challenged with 2.5 × 104 CFU/50 μl (~0.25 LD50) by intranasal (i.n.) route. Aliquots from the inoculums were plated to confirm the infecting dose. All procedures and animal protocols used in this study were approved by the Biosafety and IACUC committees at UTMB and conducted in either BSL-3 or ABSL-3 laboratories.<br><br>Cell and cytokine depletions
Acute in vivo cell/cytokine depletion was performed with monoclonal <span class="yellow">rat</span> anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> CD4 (GK1.5), CD8α (53-6.7) or B220 (RA3-6B2) obtained from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN) by methods similar to those we have previously described [19]. Functional grade purified <span class="yellow">rat</span> anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> interferon-gamma (IFN-γ, AN-18) was obtained from eBioscience (San Diego, CA) and purified anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α, MP6-XT3) from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). IFN-γ and TNF-α antibodies were injected i.p. 6 h prior to challenge, 200 μg per <span class="yellow">mouse</span> in 200 μl PBS or at later time points as indicated. <span class="yellow">Rat</span> IgG isotype control was obtained from Southern Biotech (Birmingham, AL) and administered i.p. on day of challenge, 200 μg/<span class="yellow">mouse</span>. <span class="yellow">Rat</span> anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> CD4, CD8α and B220 were injected i.p. twice, 1 day prior to challenge and on day of challenge, with an equivalent dosage sufficient to deplete T or B cells from 6 × 108 bone marrow cells per injection. The efficiency of depletion at time of infection for CD4+, CD8+, and B220+ cells was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis immediately prior to infection.<br><br>Complement depletion with cobra venom factor
<span class="yellow">Mice</span>, six to seven per group, were vaccinated i.p. with 1 × 105 CFU of nonviable <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> cell preparation in a total volume of 0.1 ml. Two weeks later, 24 h and 1 h before challenge, complement depleted <span class="blue">mice</span> were treated i.p. with 12.5 units total cobra venom factor (Quidel Corporation Speciality Products, San Diego, CA) in 0.1 ml of PBS. Complement depletion was confirmed prior to challenge by micro-titer hemolytic complement activity (CH50) assay as previously described [20].<br><br><span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> J774A.1 uptake assays
J774A.1 cells were seeded (5 × 105) onto Corning costar 24 well plates (Corning, NY) with DMEM and incubated overnight at 37°C with 5% CO2. Bacterial suspensions were incubated at 37°C for 45 minutes supplemented with 2% <span class="yellow">mouse</span> serum from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO.), heat inactivated <span class="yellow">mouse</span> serum (56°C 30 minutes), or bacteria alone and then added at an MOI of 10:1 to J774A.1 cells in triplicate. Inoculated wells were centrifuged at 800 g for 2 minutes and incubated for 2 hours at 37°C with 5% CO2 followed by a PBS wash (×2) and 2 hour incubation with 250 μg/ml kanamycin. Wells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by serial 10-fold dilutions plated on LBG plates and incubated at 37°C for 2 days. Colony forming units were enumerated and uptake expressed as a percentage of initial inoculating dose ± SEM.<br><br>Antibodies and flow cytometry
Flow cytometric analysis was performed on 0.1-ml blood samples transferred to micro centrifuge tubes containing 90 μl of acid citrate dextrose (ACD) solution. Red blood cells were lysed using ACK-lysing buffer (Biosource International, Inc., Camarillo, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Antibodies used for analysis of surface markers included: FITC-conjugated <span class="yellow">rat</span> anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> CD45R/B220 (RA3-6B2, BD Pharmingen San Diego, CA) for B cells; FITC-conjugated <span class="yellow">rat</span> anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> CD8α (53-6.7) and CD4 (GK1.5, BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) for CD8+ or CD4+ cells, respectively. Samples evaluated for CD4+ and CD8α+ cells were also incubated with biotin-conjugated <span class="yellow">hamster</span> anti-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> CD3e (145-2C11) monoclonal antibody (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) and subsequently with streptavidin APC Cy7. Isotype-matched, non-specific controls were assayed in parallel (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Surface staining was performed according to previously published protocols [21]. Following cell staining, the samples were fixed with 2% buffered paraformaldehyde overnight prior to analysis by flow cytometry. Samples were analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer with BD CellQuest Pro software.<br><br>Antibody assays
Immunoglobulin subclass IgG1 and IgG2a titers in <span class="blue">mice</span> were determined by a whole bacterial cell ELISA performed in 96-well, Immulon 2 HB, round-bottom plates (Dynex Technologies). <span class="yellow">B. mallei</span> antigen was diluted in 0.1 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.5) and 50 μl of diluted cells placed into wells. Plates were stored overnight at 4°C. The plates were washed with washing solution (1× PBS, 0.05% Tween 20), and incubated with 100 μl of blocking solution (1× PBS, 1% <span class="yellow">bovine</span> serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at 37°C. Dilutions of <span class="yellow">mouse</span> sera were made with blocking solution in duplicate and plates were incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Following incubation, plates were washed and 50 μl of anti-Ig-<span class="yellow">horseradish</span> peroxidase subclass conjugate, diluted accordingly to manufacturer's instructions (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc. Birmingham, Ala.), was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. After washing, 50 μl of 2,2'-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzthizoline)-6-sulfonate (ABTS) peroxidase substrate (KPL, Inc., Gaithersburg, Maryland) was added to each well and plates incubated for 25 min at room temperature. The amount of bound antibody was determined colorimetrically by absorbance at 405 nm.<br><br>Statistical analysis
Survival curves were calculated by Kaplan Meier survival analysis with log-rank tests between groups using GraphPad Prism (V.4.03 for windows). Statistical analysis was generally performed with the paired Student's t-test. P value ≤ 0.05 was considered significant.<br><br>
