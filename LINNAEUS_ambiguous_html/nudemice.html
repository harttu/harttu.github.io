Abstract
This study was undertaken to evaluate the role of IL-5 in eosinophil migration and in the maintenance of eosinophilia in a <span class="yellow">guinea-pig</span> model of visceral larva migrans syndrome. The results show that the infection of animals with <span class="yellow">Toxocara canis</span> induced an early increase in serum IL-5 levels that might be essential for eosinophil differentiation and proliferation and for the development of eosinophilia. When infected <span class="yellow">guinea-pigs</span> were treated with mAb anti-IL-5 (TRFK-5) given at the same time or 1 or 3 days after infection, there was a high percentage of reduction of eosinophil counts 18 days after infection. However, when the mAb was administered during the peak of eosinophilia, there was high inhibition in blood, no inhibition in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) or peritoneum and an increase in eosinophil numbers in bone marrow. Thus, a basic level of IL-5 may be essential to drive eosinophils from bone marrow to blood and tissues, and for the maintenance of eosinophilia in infected animals. We may also conclude that when eosinophils have already migrated to the lungs, TRFK-5 has no power to inhibit eosinophilia, which is also under control of local lung cells producing IL-5. In this way, only one later TRFK-5 treatment may not be sufficient to modify the lung parenchyma microenvironment, since <span class="yellow">T. canis</span> antigens had already stimulated some cell populations to produce IL-5.

In <span class="yellow">humans</span>, VLMS results from the ingestion of embryonated eggs of <span class="yellow">T. canis</span>, that eclode in the small intesfine. The infective larvae invade the mucosa, move into the liver via the portal circulation, and from there to the lungs. 2 Beaver et al., 3 who were the first to describe this syndrome, noted the intense eosinophilia which reaches more than 90% of total leucocyte counts. However, there are few studies regarding the mechanisms involved in the blood and tissue eosinophilia obseeeed in VLMS. Several investigators have suggested a direct correlation between eosinophilia and interleukin5 (IL-5) in <span class="yellow">human</span> helminth infections4'5 and in experimental animal models. 67 Inhibition of eosinophilia has been demonstrated by anti-IL-5 24 Mediators of Inflammation Vol 5 <br><br> brasiliensis, 8 $chistosoma mansoni, <span class="yellow">Toxocara canis</span>7 and <span class="yellow">Heligmosomoidespolygyrus</span>. 1 IL-5 has also been shown to support the terminal differentiation, proliferation of eosinophil precursors 11'12 and eosinophil activation. 13 Although IL-5 does not demonstrate eosinophil chemotactic activity in vivo14 there is some evidence suggesting that this cytokine may modulate a selective eosinophil accumulation at the site of inflammation. Moreover, Sehmi et a/.15 reported that IL-5 has a selective priming effect on eosinophil migratory response to nonselective chemoattractant mediators in vitro. Also, Moser et a/. 16 have demonstrated that in order to acquire the ability to transmigrate, eosinophils must be primed with IL-5, IL-3 and GM-CSF. Thus, the involvement of IL-5 in eosinophilia is not fully understood. In the present study we have used a <span class="yellow">guinea-pig</span> model of VLMS to investigate the involvement of IL-5 in eosinophil migration and in the maintenance of eosinophilia in blood, bone marrow, lung and peritoneal cavity.

Determination oflL-5 in serum: The IL-5 level in the serum of <span class="yellow">guinea-pigs</span> was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Briefly, ELISA plates (96-well Immunoplate MaxiSorp, Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with IL-5-specific monoclonal antibody (TRFK-5, 5 lag/ml in phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4, PBS, 100 l.tl/well). After 2 h of incubation at 37C, the wells were washed four times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T). Then, 100 btl of samples or recombinant <span class="yellow">murine</span> IL-5 standards (0.15-200ng/ml) in PBS-T and 2% BSA (PBSTBSA) were added to each well. After incubation for l h at 37C, the wells were washed three times and 100 l.tl of biotinylated <span class="yellow">rat</span> anti-<span class="yellow">murine</span> IL-5 (biotinylated-TRFK-5, 1 lag/ml in PBS-TBSA) was added. After incubation for 1 h at 37C, the wells were washed again three times and 100 of peroxidase-labelled streptavidin (1/1000, Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories Inc., Maryland, USA) were added to each well. Following incubation for l h at 37C and further washing, the enzyme was developed using the TMB substrate peroxidase for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 501.tl of 2.0 N HCl, and the optical densities were read at 490nm using an automated plate reader. The sensitivity of the assay was 0.15 ng/ml and the upper limit 100ng/ml. <br><br> the animal house of Ribeiro Preto, Uni<br><br> Infection of animals: <span class="yellow">T. canis</span> eggs were obtained by the methods of Olson and Schulz, 17 with minor modifications. Briefly, gravid female <span class="yellow">worms</span> were recovered from <span class="yellow">dogs</span>, and the eggs were rescued from the uterus, washed and allowed to develop to the infective stage in shallow dishes containing 0.5% formalin at 37C. Under light ether anaesthesia, the animals were infected with I ml saline containing 500 <span class="yellow">T. canis</span> eggs, by gastric intubation using a metal cannula. Blood cell counts: <span class="yellow">Guinea-pigs</span> were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone (30mg/kg, i.v.) and blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture with 10% EDTA. Total cell counts were carried out using diluting fluid in a Neubauer chamber.

The <span class="yellow">guinea-pigs</span> were killed by an overdose of sodium pentobarbitone and 5ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% sodium citrate (PBS/SC), at room temperature, were instilled through a polyethylene cannula introduced into the trachea. The cells present in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were recovered immediately. The procedure was repeated once. The leucocyte counts in the BAI_ were determined as described above, Peritoneal cells: The cells from the peritoneal cavities were harvested by injection of 10ml of PBS/SC into the peritoneum.

Data obtained from five animals. <br><br> drastically reduced, even when determined 18 days after infection (Table 1). No inhibition of eosinophil counts was observed when the animals were inoculated with the irrelevant antibody at the time of infection (Table 1). Fig. 4 shows the comparative results of eosinophilia obtained when the antibody was given 3 days or 17 days after egg inoculation. The antibody given at 3 days after infection induced a high percentage of inhibition in eosinophil counts in all the compartments analysed 18 days after infection (Fig. 4A). However, when TRFK-5 was administered to the infected animals on day 17 post-infection (thus 1 day before sacrifice), a significant inhibition in number and percentage of eosinophils was observed only in the blood (p=0.030) (Fig. 4B). A small non-significant decrease was seen in BALF (p 0.790) and peritoneum (p= 0.222). Moreover, the number of mature eosinophils in bone marrow increased by 140% (p 0.038). As demonstrated in Fig. 4B, the behaviour of eosinotShilia in BALF was completely different from that observed in blood. Thus, to better understand the eosinophilia in the lungs of infected animals, we monitored eosinophil numbers in BALF after administration of TRFK-5 at the same time, or 1, 3, 12 or 17 days after infection. The animals were sacrificed 18 days after infection. In another group, TRFK-5 was administered 18 days post-infection and the animals were sacrificed 6 days later. When the mAb was administered at the same time or 1 or 3 days postinfection there was a significant inhibition in the number of eosinophils (Fig. 5).

However, the treatment of animals with TRFK-5 at the same time of infection, or 1 day or 3 days later ted to a complete inhibition of eosinophil infiltration in the lung parenchyma (Fig. 6C). By contrast, the mononuclear cell infiltration in the lungs was not modified. When the infected <span class="yellow">guinea-pigs</span> received TRFK-5 1 day before sacrifice (or 17 days post-infection), eosinophil infiltration in the lung parenchyma was also inhibited (Fig. 6D) but not to the same extent as observed in the group receiving TRFK-5 given at the time of infection or 3 days later. Thus, the histological determination of eosinophil infiltration in these lungs corroborates a reduction but not a sizeable inhibition of eosinophil numbers as observed in the BALF of the same infected animals, <br><br> poorly defined, although T lymphocytes and mast cells appear to be involved in eosinophilia. 9'2 IL-5, a T cell-derived factor that regulates B cell functions, is an eosinophil differentiation factor11 as well as a stimulating and survival-prolonging factor specific for eosinophils in vitro. 2 Also, several investigators have demonstrated that sTstemic eosinophilia in <span class="yellow">mice</span> infected with parasites is mediated by IL-5 produced in response to the infection. 2'22 In the present study, the i.p. administration of the TRFK-5 antibody markedly inhibited the widespread eosinophilia observed in <span class="yellow">T. canis</span>-infected <span class="yellow">guinea-pigs</span>, indicating that IL5 participated in a <span class="yellow">guinea-pig</span> model of VLMS eosinophJlia. Most of the <span class="yellow">T. canis</span> larvae which penetrated the intestinal wall had migrated into the liver within 72h after inoculation as demonstrated here and elsewhere. 2 It is apparently during this interval that the worm provides the signals to cytokine-producing cells, which in turn trigger increased serum levels of specific cytokine as demonstrated here for IL-5, 24 to 72 h after infection. The signals may be provided directly by the invading parasite or by cells in response to the parasite. The cytokine pattern that develops at this early stage, probably induced by a T-cell independent pathway, may also influence the pattern of T cell differentiation into a Th2 type, which may be responsible for the second peak of IL-5 observed in our experimental model (Fig. 3), although a second cycle of larval invasion (Fig. 2) with a rapid peak of IL-5 liberation cannot be ruled out. <br><br> Discussion The results of the present study show that in our experimental model widespread eosinophilia follows the infection of <span class="yellow">guinea-pigs</span> with second stage eggs from <span class="yellow">T. canis</span>, as also noted in <span class="yellow">humans</span> and in other experimental animals. 7'7 <span class="yellow">T. canis</span> is a potent stimulus for systemic eosinophilia, since blood, BALF, peritoneum and all tissues examined (kidney, eyes, spleen, thymus, <br><br> Thus, our results suggest that the eosinophilia against helminth larvae may be initiated by the release of IL-5 when the parasites migrate from the intestine to the liver by stimulation of specific cell populations. Then, an early release of IL-5 quickly induces eosinophil recruitment, probably first from the stored mature eosinophil pool from vascular endothelium or by the mobilization of eosinophils from extravascular sites to the blood. This fact could explain why we found increased eosinophils first in blood and later in other compartments. The early IL-5 release may also serve as a signal for eosinophil differentiation and maturation in bone marrow. The time <br><br> inteeeal observed between the first peak of IL-5 release and the increase of eosinophils in blood coincides with that reported to be necessary for eosinophil differentiation and maturation in vitro. 12Increased eosinophil production and liberation into blood and other tissues occurs Mediators of Inflammation Vol 5 <br><br> 1996 <br><br> 29 <br><br> L.

Thus, early and later IL-5 release provides a necessary level of this cytokine, which is involved in the maintenance of eosinophilia. We may assume that the inhibition of the first peak of IL-5 release by TRFK-5 does not permit the subsequent T cell stimulation and differentiation. This may explain the long-lasting effect of TRFK5 treatment observed here and also reported by others. 8 In agreement with our results, there is an important observation of Svetic et al. 24 showing that a specific and highly reproducible IL-5 gene expression pattern is detectable in Peyer's patches by 6 to 12h after <span class="yellow">Heligmosomoides polygyrus</span> infection. The early increase in IL-5 gene expression after infection was probably T cell-independent, inasmuch as it was obseeeed in Peyer's patches of congenitally athymic <span class="yellow">mice</span> and of conventional <span class="yellow">mice</span> treated with anti-CD4 30 Mediators of Inflammation Vol 5 <br><br> and anti-CD8 mAb. Moreover, Kusama eta/. 25 have observed two peaks of eosinophilia in normal and athymic <span class="yellow">mice</span>, and suggested that IL-5 observed in the first peak was produced by cells other than CD4 T cells, since anti-CD4 and anti-CD3 mAb reduced only the second peak of eosinophilia in normal <span class="yellow">mice</span> and slightly reduced the first peak of eosinophilia in both normal and nu/nu <span class="yellow">mice</span>. The local lung cells producing IL-5 may also help us to explain the reason why 12, 17 or 18 days post-infection TRFK-5 treatment only partially inhibits, or does not inhibit eosinophil infiltration into the lungs, as demonstrated in Figs 5 and 6. We may suggest that when eosinophils have already migrated to the lungs, TRFK-5 has no power to inhibit eosinophilia, which is also under control of local lung cells producing IL-5. In this way, only one later TRFK<br><br> 1996 <br><br> IL-5 drives eosinophils in <span class="yellow">guinea-pig</span> <br><br> 5 treatment may not be sufficient to modify the lung parenchyma microenvironment, since <span class="yellow">T. canis</span> antigens have already stimulated some cell populations to produce IL-5, as demonstrated by Kusama et aL25These results suggest that eosinophilia in lungs is under the control of different factors when compared to that observed in blood and the peritoneal cavity. One of the most important results obtained here was the inhibition of circulating eosinophil numbers by the different mAb treatments, even when the antibody was given at the peak of blood eosinophilia, which was accompanied by an increase of mature eosinophils in bone marrow. This suggests that IL-5, apart from being required for the terminal differentiation of eosinophils in bone marrow, 26 is also likely to drive eosinophils from the bone marrow to the blood and then to the tissues, probably by upregulating VLA-4 expression in eosinophils. Moser et aL have demonstrated that in order to acquire the ability to transmigrate, eosinophils must be primed with cytokines such as IL-5, IL-3 or GM-CSF for expression of adhesion molecules such as VI-4.

Abstract
Background
p8 is a stress-induced protein with multiple functions and biochemically related to the architectural factor HMG-I/Y. We analyzed the expression and function of p8 in pancreatic cancer-derived cells.<br><br>Methods
Expression of p8 was silenced in the <span class="yellow">human</span> pancreatic cancer cell lines Panc-1 and BxPc-3 by infection with a retrovirus expressing p8 RNA in the antisense orientation. Cell growth was measured in control and p8-silenced cells. Influence on p8 expression of the induction of intracellular pathways promoting cellular growth or growth arrest was monitored.<br><br>Results
p8-silenced cells grew more rapidly than control cells transfected with the empty retrovirus. Activation of the Ras→Raf→MEK→ERK and JNK intracellular pathways down-regulated p8 expression. In addition, the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 up-regulates expression of p8. Conversely, p38 or TGFβ-1 induced p8 expression whereas the specific p38 inhibitor SB203580 down-regulated p8 expression. Finally, TGFβ-1 induction was in part mediated through p38.<br><br>Conclusions
p8 inhibits the growth of <span class="yellow">human</span> pancreatic cancer cells. p8 expression is induced through pathways involved in growth inhibition and repressed by factors that promote cell growth. These results suggest that p8 belongs to a pathway regulating the growth of pancreatic cancer cells.<br><br><br><br>Background
While studying the molecular response of the injured pancreas, we identified a new gene, called p8, whose expression is strongly induced during the acute phase of pancreatitis [1]. Further experiments have shown that p8 mRNA is activated in almost all cells in response to several stresses [2], including minimal stresses such as after routine change of the culture medium in the absence of any added substance [3], indicating that p8 is a ubiquitous protein induced by cellular stress. The p8 gene was cloned in <span class="yellow">human</span>, <span class="yellow">rat</span>, <span class="yellow">mouse</span>, and <span class="yellow">Xenopus laevis</span> [1,4-6], conceptually translated from the <span class="yellow">Drosophila melanogaster</span> genome or deduced from EST libraries (<span class="yellow">Bos taurus</span>, <span class="yellow">Xenopus tropicalis</span>, <span class="yellow">Zebrafish</span>, <span class="yellow">Orzzias latipes</span>, <span class="yellow">Bombyx mori</span> and <span class="yellow">Paralichthys olivaceous</span>). The overall degree of homology with <span class="yellow">human</span> p8 ranged from 81 to 40%. Secondary structure prediction methods indicated that within the homologous region of the eleven proteins, there is a basic Helix-Loop-Helix secondary structure motif, characteristic of some classes of transcription factors [1]. Even though a small protein such as p8 would not need a nuclear localization signal (NLS) to be transported to the nucleus, a clear NLS can be predicted for the eleven proteins comprising a bipartite domain of positively charged aminoacids. In addition, a nuclear/cytoplasmic location has been demonstrated for <span class="yellow">human</span> p8 upon overexpression of the recombinant protein and immunohistochemistry [4], and for recombinant <span class="yellow">Xenopus laevis</span> p8 fused to green fluorescent protein [6]. Homology searching in databases did not reveal significant similarity of p8 with other proteins of known function. However, biochemical properties of the mammalian p8 proteins are shared by some high mobility group proteins (HMG) [7], particularly by the HMG-I/Y family. The overall identity of <span class="yellow">human</span> p8 with <span class="yellow">human</span> HMG-I/Y is only about 35%, but the molecular mass, isoelectric point, hydrophilicity plot, the resistance to denaturation after heating at 100°C and the charge separation are very similar [8]. The p8 protein seems to bind DNA weakly, as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, without preference for DNA sequences. Finally, <span class="yellow">human</span> p8 has also been shown to be a substrate for protein kinase A in vitro and phosphorylated p8 has a higher content of secondary structure and binding to DNA is highly increased [8]. An architectural role in transcription has been proposed for this protein, in analogy with the HMG-I/Y proteins, and a recent work seems to confirm this hypothesis [9].
Functions of p8 appear to be multiple and complex. For example, p8 mRNA expression was strongly induced in 3T3 cells upon TGFβ-1 treatment which in turn enhances the Smad-transactivating function responsible for TGFβ-1 activity [10]. We also found that p8 is involved in cell cycle regulation since p8-deficient embryonic fibroblasts grew more rapidly and incorporated more [3H] thymidine and BrdU than p8-expressing cells [11]. Moreover, expression of p8 in breast cancer-derived cells seems to mediate the inhibition of cell growth induced by 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 [12]. On the contrary, we also reported that p8 may promote cell growth when overexpressed in Cos-7, AR42J and HeLa cells [1,4]. In addition, p8 seems to be involved in other intracellular functions such as apoptosis since p8-expressing fibroblasts are more sensitive than p8-deficient fibroblasts to the apoptosis induced by DNA damage. Also, p8 is required for endothelin-induced mesangial cell hypertrophy in diabetic kidney, in a mechanism involving ERK, JNK and PI3 kinase [13]. p8 seems to play a functional role in the initiation of LHβ gene expression during embryonic cell differentiation [14]. Moreover, the <span class="yellow">Drosophila melanogaster</span> p8 homologue is involved in response to starvation and might be activated to stop cell growth in case of nutrient deprivation [15]. Finally, a particularly attractive role in tumour progression was recently proposed for p8 [16]. Fibroblasts obtained from p8-expressing or p8-deficient animals were transformed with a retroviral vector expressing both the rasV12 mutated protein and the E1A adenoviral oncogene. In soft-agar assays, transformed p8-expressing cells formed colonies at high frequency, as expected, but p8-deficient transformed fibroblasts were unable to form colonies. Similarly, transformed p8-expressing cells produced tumours in all athymic <span class="blue">nude mice</span> when injected subcutaneously or intraperitoneally, whereas transformed p8-deficient fibroblasts did not. On the other hand, studies by another laboratory revealed that expression of the Com1 protein [17], which is identical to <span class="yellow">human</span> p8, mediates the growth of tumour cells after metastatic establishment in a secondary organ, indicating that activated expression of Com1/p8 in metastatic cells is required for tumour progression. These results strongly suggest that p8 is involved in the cellular pathway(s) required for tumour progression and metastasis.
Our aim is to check the relevance of p8 to cancer progression in <span class="yellow">human</span>. As a first step, we investigated in the present study the function of p8 in two cell lines derived from <span class="yellow">human</span> pancreatic cancer. We observed that inhibition of p8 expression increased the cells growth rate. In addition, activations of the Ras→Raf→MEK→ERK and JNK intracellular pathways, which promote the growth of pancreatic cells, down-regulated p8 expression, whereas activation of p38 or TGFβ-1, which inhibit cell growth, induced its expression. It was concluded that i/ p8 inhibits the growth of <span class="yellow">human</span> pancreatic cancer cell lines, ii/ p8 expression is induced through pathways involved in growth inhibition and, conversely, repressed by factors that promote cell growth.<br><br>Results
p8 is silenced in pancreatic cancer cells by infection with a retrovirus expressing p8 RNA in the antisense orientation
Panc-1 and BxPc-3 pancreatic cells were chosen for this study because, on the one hand, both cells express higher level of p8 (Figure 1) and, on the other hand, because Panc-1 is wild-type for Smad4/DPC4 and mutated for K-ras, while BxPc-3 is Smad4/DPC4 mutated and K-ras wild-type [18,19], therefore representing different mechanisms of transformation and different genetic backgrounds. K-ras and Smad4/DPC4 mutations are the major mechanisms involved in pancreatic cancer development. We inhibited p8 expression in both Panc-1 and BxPc-3 pancreatic cells by infecting cells with a retrovirus expressing the p8 asRNA (antisense RNA) and carrying the puromycin resistance. The antibiotic-selected cells were analyzed by Western blotting to evaluate the intracellular amounts of p8 protein. As shown in Figure 2, the p8 protein was clearly visible in both Panc-1 and BxPc-3 pancreatic cells infected with the empty retrovirus but almost undetectable in cells infected with the retrovirus encoding the p8 asRNA showed, indicating that our anti-sense strategy is efficient to silence p8 gene expression in pancreatic cancer cells. Preliminary studies had been conducted to select the best strategy to inhibit p8 expression. We compared the efficacy of the stable transfection of a siRNA, using a retroviral expression vector to the asRNA strategy described above. In our hands, the antisense strategy worked best, as judged from Western blot assessment of p8 protein expression (data not shown).<br><br>p8-silenced pancreatic cells grow more rapidly
We compared in the two cell lines the influence on growth parameters of blocking p8 expression with the p8 asRNA. Figure 3 shows that both Panc-1 and BxPc-3 cells in which p8 has been silenced grew more rapidly than cells infected with the empty vector suggesting that inhibition by p8 of pancreatic cancer cell growth is independent from the mechanism of transformation and genetic background.<br><br>Serum-stimulated cellular growth down-regulates p8 expression
Fetal <span class="yellow">calf</span> serum, which contains a complex mix of growth factors, can be used as inductor of cell growth. As shown in Figure 4 expression of p8 mRNA was down-regulated in both Panc-1 and BxPc-3 when the cells were shifted from culture media containing 0.1% fetal <span class="yellow">calf</span> serum to media containing 10% FCS. p8 protein showed a similar behavior. These results show that p8 expression is down-regulated in growing pancreatic cells.<br><br>The Ras→Raf→MEK→ERK pathway down-regulates p8 expression in pancreatic cancer cells
Most <span class="yellow">human</span> pancreatic cancers harbor mutations in the K-ras oncogene, which happens relatively early in pancreatic tumorigenesis [20]. The oncogenic mutation of the K-ras gene stabilizes the Ras protein in a GTP-bound form, which is constitutively active and make the cells grow more rapidly. Contrary to the activated Ras protein, p8 inhibits cell growth (Figure 3). We looked whether the Ras→Raf→MEK→ERK pathway was also involved in the regulation of p8 expression, and which step(s) were critical. Figure 5 shown that expression of a mutated form of the Ras protein (rasV12) in BxPc-3 cells, which are wild-type for ras, resulted in decreased p8 mRNA concentration and protein level suggesting that the activated ras inhibits p8 expression. Figure 6 shows that overexpression of Raf, but not of Raf301 (a negative mutant of Raf), and of ERK also inhibited the expression of the p8-CAT construct in Panc-1 as well as in BxPc-3. Finally, the MEK1/2 specific inhibitor U0126 [21] activated p8 mRNA expression in pancreatic cells whether they carry mutated ras (Panc-1) or wild-type (BxPc-3). Similar results were observed when expression of the p8 protein was monitored by Western blotting (Figure 7).<br><br>Activation of the JNK pathway down-regulates p8 expression in pancreatic cancer cells
c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) is another major MAPK pathway which converts extracellular signals into expression of specific target genes through phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors. JNK activation has been implicated in various, often opposite cellular responses, such as cell proliferation, transformation and apoptosis. As shown in Figure 8, overexpression of JNK down-regulates the gene reporter activity of the p8-CAT construct in Panc-1 cells. Similar results were found in BxPc-3 cells. Treatment of these cells with the JNK specific inhibitor SP600125 [22] up-regulates expression of the p8 mRNA and p8 protein (Figure 9). These results show that the JNK pathway is involved in the regulation of p8 expression.<br><br>The p38 pathway up-regulates p8 expression in pancreatic cancer cells
The p38 signal transduction pathway also plays an essential role in regulating several cell functions including growth, response to inflammation, differentiation and apoptosis. In fact, in pancreatic cancer cells, p38 is a strong inhibitor of proliferation [23] contrary to the Ras→Raf→MEK→ERK and JNK pathways. We therefore analyzed the putative role of the p38 pathway in regulating p8 expression in pancreatic cancer cells. Figure 10 shows that over-expression of the plasmid encoding p38 significantly increases p8-CAT activity in Panc-1 as well as in BxPc-3 cells. Then, cells were treated with SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 [24], and p8 expression was measured. p8 mRNA as well as the encoded protein were down-regulated after inhibition of the p38 activity (Figure 11). These results indicate that the p38 pathway is a positive regulator of p8 expression in pancreatic cancer cells.<br><br>TGFβ-1 up-regulates p8 expression in pancreatic cancer cells
The most prominent biological activity of TGFβ-1 is its potent inhibition of cell growth in a wide variety of cell types including pancreatic cells. TGFβ-1 signals are sent through two types of transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors. In fact, TGFβ-1 binds and brings together the type I and type II receptors. In the resulting complex, the constitutively active TGFβ-1 type II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor, which then plays a major role in transducing the signal to downstream components to affect gene expression through phosphorylation of SMAD proteins. Phosphorylated receptor-regulated SMADs then form heteromeric complexes with the common partner SMAD4. These heteromeric complexes then move to the nucleus, where SMAD4 will bind DNA and contribute to transcriptional activation. In general, pancreatic cancer cells present with defects in TGFβ-1 signaling and are resistant to TGFβ-1-mediated growth suppression. Since TGFβ-1 and p8 are inhibitors of pancreatic cell growth we analyzed whether p8 could mediate, at least in part, the effect of TGFβ-1. First, we found that treatment of Panc-1 cells with TGFβ-1 increased p8 mRNA levels and p8 protein as judged by Western blot (Figure 12). Then, to confirm that overexpression is regulated at the transcriptional level, we analyzed the effect of some constructs expressing constitutively activated type I TGFβ receptor, dominant negative type II TGFβ receptor, a dominant negative of Smad4 and the wild-type Smad4 on the p8-CAT activity. As expected, the constitutively activated type I TGFβ receptor but not the dominant negative type II TGFβ receptor increased CAT activity. Also, expression of the Smad4, contrary to that of the negative mutant, induced p8 transcription (Figure 13). Together, these results indicate that p8 is positively regulated by TGFβ-1.
Beside the Smad proteins, TGFβ-1 also activates the p38 MAPK pathway in pancreas-derived cells, which may play an important role in TGFβ-1 induced genes [25]. Therefore, we analyzed the p38-dependent effect of TGFβ-1 on p8 transcription. As shown in Figure 13, inhibition of p38 activity with the SB203580 specific inhibitor decreased about 40% the activity of TGFβ-1 on the p8 promoter indicating that the effect of TGFβ-1 on p8 promoter is mediated by both p38-dependent and p38-independent pathways.<br><br>
Discussion
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the fourth leading cause of death from malignant diseases [26]. The aggressive nature of the neoplasia, the lack of early detection, and the limited response to treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy contribute to the high mortality rate of the disease. Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular mechanism leading to pancreatic cancer remains a major goal because it may help proposing strategies for earlier diagnosis and better treatment. The most commonly altered genes in pancreatic adenocarcinoma are K-ras (75 to 100%), p16INK4a (95%), p53 (50 to 75%) and DPC4 (50%) [27-31]. Whereas K-ras is a proto-oncogene all the others are tumour suppressor genes. Additional genes have been found altered at lower frequency. Panc-1 and BxPc-3 pancreatic cells were chosen for this study because they both express high levels of p8 (Figure 1) and because they present with different mechanisms of transformation and genetic backgrounds, Panc-1 being wild-type for Smad4/DPC4 but mutated for K-ras and BxPc-3 mutated for Smad4/DPC4 and wild-type for K-ras [18,19]. This work presents evidences that p8 inhibits the growth rate of pancreatic cancer-derived cells and that the intracellular pathways promoting cell growth down-regulate p8 expression whereas those promoting growth arrest up-regulate its expression. Together, these results suggest that p8 is downstream of some cell growth regulators and therefore regulation of p8 expression or its activity could be used as a target for treating pancreatic cancer.
Silencing p8 expression was able to strongly promote cell growth in both cell types, Panc-1 and BxPc-3, suggesting that p8 may act downstream of the ras- or Smad4/DPC4-dependent ways. Also, we found that stimulating cell growth by the complex combination of growth factors contained in fetal <span class="yellow">calf</span> serum down-regulated expression of p8 whereas, on the contrary, treating the cells with TGFβ-1, which promotes cell cycle arrest, stimulates p8 expression. Therefore, p8 gene expression seems to be regulated in opposite directions by mechanisms promoting cell growth or cell cycle arrest. It is interesting to note that while p8 expression is under the control of cell growth regulatory pathways such as Ras→Raf→MEK→ERK, JNK, p38 and TGFβ-1, p8 can affect cell cycle progression, suggesting that p8 is a target for factors regulating pancreatic cell growth.
A mechanism by which p8 could regulate cell cycle progression in embryonic fibroblasts was previously proposed [11]. In fact, p8 seems to take action upstream from cyclin-dependent kinases because the intracellular levels and activities of Cdk2 and Cdk4 are decreased when p8 is expressed. Concomitantly, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 is expressed at a low level in p8-deficient cells which may explain the increased activity of Cdk2 and Cdk4. The mechanism by which p8 regulates the intracellular level of those proteins remains to be determined. However, because p8 is a transcriptional cofactor, it is possible that regulation of expression of these molecules takes place, at least in part, at the transcription level.
Interestingly, expression of p8 mRNA seems to be regulated in a cell type- and stimulus-specific manner since, for example, p38 can induce p8 expression in response to stress in fibroblasts [3] but not in renal mesangial cells treated with endothelin [13]. In pancreatic cancer-derived cells p38 seems to play a major role since it is involved in p8 activation as judged by transient transfection assays and using a specific p38 inhibitor (Figures 10 and 11). In addition, p38 is also involved in TGFβ-1-induced p8 expression because about 40% of the TGFβ-1 effect was abolished when p38 activity was specifically blocked (Figure 13). On the other hand, ERK and JNK are inducers of p8 expression in mesangial cells treated with endothelin, but not involved in the activation of p8 in response to stress in fibroblasts [3], and even repressors in pancreatic cells (Figures 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9). Finally, PI3 kinase is an inducer of p8 expression in both endothelin-mediated p8 activation in mesangial cells [13] and pancreatic cells (data not shown).
Based on these observations, overexpression of p8 could be considered a possible goal for treating pancreatic tumours, in order to limit their growth. However, we previously reported that p8 repression would prevent rasV12/E1A transformed fibroblasts from evolving as tumours in <span class="blue">nude mice</span> [16]. This apparent contradiction needs to be resolved before considering p8 as a target for treating cancer progression.<br><br>Conclusions
In conclusion (see Figure 14), we report in this paper that inhibition of p8 expression by an anti-sense strategy increases the growth rate of both Panc-1 and BxPc-3 pancreatic cancer-derived cells. Moreover, ERK- and JNK-mediated pathways down-regulate p8 expression, whereas p38 and TGFβ-1 pathways induce p8 expression. Also, cell growth triggered by expression of a RAS mutated protein or by 10% fetal <span class="yellow">calf</span> serum induces down-regulation of p8 expression. Together, these results indicate that p8 is an intracellular cell growth inhibitor and that it is oppositely regulated by growth-promoting or growth-inhibiting factors in pancreatic cancer-derived cells.<br><br>Material and Methods

Expression plamids encoding p38 (pCEFL HA p38), Erk2 (pcDNAIII HA ERK2), JNK (pcDNAIIIB HA JNK), the wild-type Raf (pcDNA RAF BXB) and the Raf dominant negative (pcDNA RAF 301 K375W) were obtained from O Coso (University of Buenos Aires). Plamids encoding the constitutively activated type I TGFβ receptor (RI ACT), the dominant negative type II TGFβ receptor (RII DN) and the Smad4 dominant negative (DPC4 1–514 a.a.) were obtained from R Urrutia (Mayo Clinic, Rochester) and the wild type Smad4 was from C Heldin (Ludwig Institute, Uppsala).<br><br>Pancreatic p8-deficient cells
To silence p8 expression in pancreatic cells, we infected these cells with a retrovirus expressing <span class="yellow">human</span> p8 in the antisense orientation. The retroviral vector was constructed as follows: <span class="yellow">human</span> p8 cDNA was subcloned in HindIII and XhoI restriction sites of the pLPC plasmid (obtained from S. Lowe) in the antisense orientation. Amphotrope <span class="yellow">human</span> p8 expressing retrovirus was then generated by transient transfection using Phoenix amphotrope packaging cells. Viral supernatant was used to infect Panc-1 and BxPc-3 pancreatic cells and the population of p8-silenced cells was isolated by selection in presence of puromycin (1 μg/ml). As control, cells were infected with the pLPC empty vector.<br><br>p8 expression in arrested and growing cells
One million of Panc-1 or BxPc-3 cells were cultivated on 10-cm Petri plates in standard conditions (with 10% FCS). After 48 h, culture media were changed for fresh media with FCS restricted to 0.1%, in order to stop growth. After 24 hours of growth arrest, culture medium was replaced either by medium with 10% fetal <span class="yellow">calf</span> serum to resume cell growth or, as control, by medium with 0.1% fetal <span class="yellow">calf</span> serum. Twenty four hours later cells were recovered and RNA and protein extracted.<br><br>p8 expression in TGFβ-1-treated Panc-1 cells
One million of Panc-1 cells were cultivated in 10-cm culture dishes for 48 hours under standard conditions before TGFβ-1 treatment. <span class="yellow">Human</span> recombinant TGFβ-1 (5 ng/ml) was added to cells, without changing the culture medium, and cells were collected 12 hours later for RNA and protein preparation.<br><br>BxPc-3 rasV12-expressing cells
pLPC-rasV12 and pLPC plasmids were obtained from S. Lowe. Phoenix amphotrope packaging cells (106) were plated in a 6-well plate, incubated for 24 hours, then transfected with PEI with 5 μg of retroviral plasmid. After 48 hours, the medium containing virus was filtered (0.45 μm filter, Millipore) to obtain the viral supernatant. Target BxPc-3 were plated at 2 × 105 cells per 35-mm dish and incubated overnight. For infections, the culture medium was replaced by an appropriate mix of the viral supernatant and culture medium (V/V), supplemented with 4 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma), and cells were incubated at 37°C. BxPc-3 rasV12-expressing cells were selected with puromycin (1 μg/ml). Cells infected with the pLPC empty vector were used as control.<br><br>Western-blot analyses
One hundred μg of total protein extracted from cells was separated with standard procedures on 15.0% SDS-PAGE using the Mini Protean System (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Sigma).

One hundred thousand cells per well were plated in a series of 35-mm culture dishes. The cell number was estimated daily in triplicate, during 1 to 5 days, in a haemocytometer. Within experiments, each point was determined at least two times.<br><br>Cell transfection and gene reporter assays
Panc-1 and BxPc-3 (105) were cultivated in 30 mm diameter culture dishes for 24 hours then transiently transfected with 0.5 μg of p8-CAT reporter plasmid and 0.5 μg of pCMV/βgal plasmid (to control transfection efficiency) using the Fugene reagent in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The p8-CAT plasmid is the previously reported p-1471/+37p8-CAT promoter construct [5]. Reporter activities were measured as previously described [5]. Briefly, cell extracts were prepared with the reporter lysis buffer (Promega) 24 hours after transfection and CAT activity was determined by the phase extraction procedure [32] and β-galactosidase assay was performed essentially as described in Sambrook et al. [33]. CAT activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Experiments were carried out in triplicate and repeated at least two times. Expression plasmids (0.5 μg) were co-transfected with p8-CAT and pCMV/βgal plasmids as indicated.<br><br>RT-PCR analysis

<h3>pmcA1779460</h3>MUC1 alters oncogenic events and transcription in <span class="yellow">human</span> breast cancer cells
Abstract
Introduction
MUC1 is an oncoprotein whose overexpression correlates with aggressiveness of tumors and poor survival of cancer <span class="yellow">patients</span>. Many of the oncogenic effects of MUC1 are believed to occur through interaction of its cytoplasmic tail with signaling molecules. As expected for a protein with oncogenic functions, MUC1 is linked to regulation of proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and transcription.<br><br>Methods
To clarify the role of MUC1 in cancer, we transfected two breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-468 and BT-20) with small interfering (si)RNA directed against MUC1 and analyzed transcriptional responses and oncogenic events (proliferation, apoptosis and invasion).<br><br>Results
Transcription of several genes was altered after transfection of MUC1 siRNA, including decreased MAP2K1 (MEK1), JUN, PDGFA, CDC25A, VEGF and ITGAV (integrin αv), and increased TNF, RAF1, and MMP2. Additional changes were seen at the protein level, such as increased expression of c-Myc, heightened phosphorylation of AKT, and decreased activation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. These were correlated with cellular events, as MUC1 siRNA in the MDA-MB-468 line decreased proliferation and invasion, and increased stress-induced apoptosis. Intriguingly, BT-20 cells displayed similar levels of apoptosis regardless of siRNA, and actually increased proliferation after MUC1 siRNA.<br><br>Conclusion
These results further the growing knowledge of the role of MUC1 in transcription, and suggest that the regulation of MUC1 in breast cancer may be more complex than previously appreciated. The differences between these two cell lines emphasize the importance of understanding the context of cell-specific signaling events when analyzing the oncogenic functions of MUC1, and caution against generalizing the results of individual cell lines without adequate confirmation in intact biological systems.<br><br><br><br>Introduction
MUC1 is the founding member of the mucin family: proteins characterized by heavy O-glycosylation centering around a variable number of tandem repeats that are rich in serine and threonine residues [1,2]. MUC1 is a transmembrane heterodimer with one subunit solely extracellular (MUC1-EX), and the other subunit composed of a short extracellular stem, a single transmembrane domain, and the cytoplasmic tail (together called the MUC1-CT). MUC1 possesses both pro- and anti-adhesive capacities, as the MUC1-EX provides binding sites for a variety of adhesion proteins, while its large size and extended structure prevents cell-cell contact [3-5].
Initially described as a tumor antigen overexpressed in >90% of breast cancers, MUC1 is now known to be an oncogene with roles in both tumor formation and progression [1,6]. <span class="yellow">Mouse</span> studies have been integral to the current understanding of MUC1 in cancer. Muc1 knockout <span class="yellow">mice</span> (Muc1-/-; MUC1 is <span class="yellow">human</span>; Muc1 is <span class="yellow">mouse</span>) show a reduction in tumorigenic phenotype when crossed onto <span class="yellow">mice</span> overexpressing the Wnt-1 [7] or polyomavirus middle T antigen [8] oncogenes in the mammary gland. In contrast, MUC1 overexpression in the mammary gland drives tumor formation [9], indicating that MUC1 is a true oncogene.
Many of the oncogenic effects of MUC1 stem from its cytoplasmic tail, which binds to several proteins implicated in cancer, including c-Src [10,11] and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family [12,13]. MUC1 stimulates mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling through the extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERK1/2) [12,14]; this can occur through MUC1 association with Grb2 and son of sevenless to activate Ras [15]. ERK1/2 signaling is commonly stimulated by the Ras-Raf-MEK (MAPK and ERK kinase) cascade downstream of mitogens such as EGFR [16], and regulates transcription via factors like the activator protein-1 complex. Loss of MUC1 can reduce EGFR expression [17], providing another means of affecting MAPK signaling. Our results describe a novel mechanism by which MUC1 regulates the ERK1/2 pathway, through modulating transcription of the genes encoding MEK1, Raf-1, and c-Jun.
MUC1 expression correlates with increased survival in response to cytotoxic or oxidative agents [18-21], and can activate the phosphoinositol-3 kinase-AKT pathway as part of an anti-apoptotic response [18]. MUC1 has also recently been linked to transcription, as the MUC1-CT localizes to the nucleus [22] and affects transcription by β-catenin [22,23], FOXO3a [21], p53 [24], and estrogen receptor α [25]. However, there are indications that the role of MUC1 in oncogenesis is regulated by cell type and signaling context. For example, MUC1 can stimulate Fas-mediated apoptosis [26], while Muc1 is specifically down-regulated in c-neu-induced mammary tumors [27]. This report emphasizes the complexity of MUC1 signaling in breast cancer by contrasting results from two established breast cancer cell lines.
To understand MUC1 function in cells with high endogenous expression, that is, cells likely to have evolved with active MUC1 signaling, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to knock down MUC1 in MDA-MB-468 and BT-20 cells. We then analyzed transcription of 84 genes involved in cancer, as well as the effects upon cellular events linked to oncogenesis, such as apoptosis and proliferation. Though the cell lines show some similarity in transcriptional alterations after transfection with MUC1 siRNA, their phenotypes are quite dissimilar: MDA-MB-468 increases apoptosis and reduces proliferation and invasion, while BT-20 proliferates more rapidly after loss of MUC1. This last may reflect the striking amount of active AKT in BT-20; AKT activity is increased in both cell lines after MUC1 siRNA, which agrees with a previous study of MUC1 siRNA [21], but disagrees with results from 3Y1 fibroblasts [18]. Recent studies have emphasized the complex and context-specific regulation of even such classic oncogenes as AKT [28]. The differences between the two breast cancer cell lines in this study suggest that MUC1 oncogenic functions are also subject to cell-specific regulation, and stress the need for understanding the cellular signaling context when interpreting results.<br><br>Materials and methods
Cell culture and siRNA transfection
MDA-MB-468 and BT-20 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) plus 10% fetal <span class="yellow">calf</span> serum, 1% Glutamax (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Stable cell lines (468.Neo and 468.MUC1Δ8) were selected with 0.5 mg/ml G418. For epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation, MDA-MB-468 cells were serum-starved overnight and treated for 10 minutes at 37°C with 100 ng/ml EGF. Transient siRNA transfection was performed with Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) and 100 nM siRNA oligonucleotides. The commercially available siRNA constructs (all from Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, USA) were scrambled (siCONTROL non-targeting siRNA #1), or directed against firefly luciferase (siCONTROL non-targeting siRNA #2) or MUC1 (siGENOME smartpool). The independent oligonucleotides designed in our laboratory target sequences beginning at MUC1 codons 882 and 956, and have been described previously [29]. The scrambled siRNA construct was used only in BT-20 cells as it causes a non-specific knockdown of MUC1 in the MDA-MB-468 line.<br><br>Cloning of MUC1 WT vector and stable transfection
Two silent mutations (G891A and T894C) were introduced into the MUC1 cDNA (called MUC1Δ8) to make it resistant to the 882 siRNA that targets that region of the mRNA. The mutant cDNA was cloned into the pLNCX.1 vector with neomycin resistance (gift of Joseph Loftus, Mayo Clinic, Arizona, USA). Stable transfection was performed with Lipofectamine2000; cells were selected beginning 24 hours post-transfection and maintained as a polyclonal population.<br><br>Western blots and antibodies
Cells were lysed in buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 150 mM sodium chloride, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA) with commercial protease (Complete inhibitor cocktail, Roche, Pleasanton, CA, USA) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mM sodium fluoride, 2 mM sodium vanadate, 50 μM ammonium molybdate). Protein concentration was determined by BCA (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA); 50 μg of lysate were loaded on SDS-PAGE gels for each experiment, except for the pMEK1/2 blot in MDA-MB-468, where 150 μg were used. Non-commercial antibodies used were: BC2, a <span class="yellow">mouse</span> monoclonal to the MUC1-EX (gift of Dr McGuckin, Queensland University, Queensland, Australia), and CT2, an <span class="yellow">Armenian hamster</span> monoclonal to the MUC1-CT developed in our lab [12]. Antibodies to pMEK1/2, MEK1/2, ERK1/2, Myc, pAKT, AKT, β-tubulin (all Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), β-actin and dpERK1/2 (both Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) were used according to manufacturers' recommendations. All antibodies except β-actin (1:2,500) and dpERK1/2 (1:10,000) were used at 1:1,000 dilution for western blots. Flow cytometric analysis of MUC1 was done with HMPV-FITC, which recognizes the core peptide of the MUC1-EX tandem repeats (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) staining was performed with a fluorescently conjugated antibody to BrdU (BrdU-PE, BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) as described below. Densitometry was performed using the public domain ImageJ program (developed at the NIH and available at [30]. Each band was measured in three places; the results were averaged and normalized to tubulin to control for loading.<br><br>Transwell invasion assays
Cells were serum-starved beginning 24 hours post-siRNA transfection. Cells were re-plated in serum-free medium 48 hours post-transfection at 50,000 cells per insert (sized for 24-well plates), with serum-containing medium in the bottom of the growth well as an attractant. Transwell inserts (BD Biosciences) pre-coated with laminin, fibronectin, collagen IV, or control (no matrix) were used, and cells were permitted to invade for 48 hours. At this point (96 hours post-transfection), visual inspection of the growth wells confirmed that negligible numbers of cells went through to the bottom of the plate. Non-invaded cells were swabbed from the tops of half of the inserts ('samples', containing only invaded cells), and retained in the others ('controls', all cells). Inserts were stained for 10 minutes with crystal violet (0.5% in 20% methanol) and washed with water. Membranes were cut out and destained for 10 minutes in 10% acetic acid in a 96-well plate; membranes were removed and absorbance was read at 570 nm. Percent invasion is defined as (absorbance of samples/absorbance of controls) × 100.<br><br>[3H]Thymidine incorporation assays
Cells were re-plated in quadruplicate 24 hours post-siRNA transfection at 15,000 cells/well (96-well plate) with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well), then incubated in normal conditions for 24 hours. At this time (48 hours post-siRNA transfection) excess radioactivity was washed off and the cells were harvested and read on a TopCount plate reader. Statistical analysis was performed using JMP 5.1.2 software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA); the student's t test was used to determine p values and significance was confirmed with Wilcoxon rank sum and Pearson chi squared analyses.<br><br>BrdU incorporation
BrdU (50 μM) was given to cells 48 hours post-siRNA transfection and permitted to incorporate for 1.5 hours. Cells were then washed with PBS, trypsinized, and washed again. BrdU staining was performed according to an adaptation of the manufacturer's protocol: cells were re-suspended in PBS, mixed 1:1 with -20°C neat ethanol, and incubated 1 hour at -20°C to fix. Fixed cells were then washed gently and denatured in 2 M HCl for 20 minutes at room temperature. Following washing and 2 minute's incubation with 0.1 M Tris to neutralize the acid, cells were re-suspended in FACS buffer (0.5% fetal <span class="yellow">calf</span> serum in PBS) and stained with Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-BrdU according to the manufacturer's protocol for flow cytometry analysis on a FACScan instrument.<br><br>Apoptosis and trypan blue staining
Apoptosis was measured using a kit (BD Biosciences) containing propidium iodide (PI) and FITC-conjugated annexin V. Cells were stained according to the manufacturer's protocol and the level of apoptosis determined by flow cytometry. Quadrants are: early apoptosis (annexin V+/PI-, lower right) late apoptosis (annexin V+/PI+, upper right) and non-apoptotic cell death (annexin V-/PI+, upper left). Treatments for the stress panel were: no treatment (control); DMSO as a control for celecoxib; 20 mM celecoxib, brand name Celebrex™ (dissolved in DMSO) [31]; 0.2 mM H2O2 [32]; or 1 mg/mL G418 (Pfizer, New York, NY, USA).<br><br>Real-time PCR arrays
Transcriptional analysis using Cancer PathwayFinder RT2 profiler arrays (SuperArray, Frederick, MD, USA) was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA); 1 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed with the cDNA synthesis kit (SuperArray) and cDNA was subjected to real-time PCR using SYBR green to detect product. Arrays were performed independently at least twice for each cell line; all PCR products were checked on agarose gels. Values were obtained for the threshold cycle (Ct) for each gene and normalized using the average of four housekeeping genes on the same array (HPRT1, RPL13A, GAPD, ACTB). Ct values for housekeeping genes and a dilution series of ACTB were monitored for consistency between arrays. Change (ΔCt) between MUC1 siRNA and control siRNA was found by:
ΔCt = Ct(MUC1 siRNA) - Ct(control siRNA)
and fold change by:
Fold change = 2(-ΔCt)
Values are given as fold change; only genes showing two-fold or greater change were considered. Both luciferase and scrambled siRNA controls were used in BT-20; only genes showing consistent alteration with both controls were included in the results reported here. The scrambled siRNA could be not used in MDA-MB-468 as these cells decrease MUC1 expression in response to this construct.<br><br>
Results
siRNA transfection decreases MUC1 expression in breast cancer cell lines
Two <span class="yellow">human</span> breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-468 and BT-20, were transiently transfected with a pool of four siRNA oligonucleotides directed against the MUC1 mRNA (468.siMUC1 and BT.siMUC1), or a control oligonucleotide directed against luciferase (468.siLuc and BT.siLuc). Both cell lines express high levels of MUC1, making them promising targets for this analysis. Western blots (Figure 1a) show successful knockdown of both the extracellular domain and cytoplasmic tail fragments of MUC1; luciferase siRNA does not substantially change the level of MUC1 compared to parental cells. 468.siMUC1 show a substantial decrease in the amount of MUC1-CT, while BT.siMUC1 show slightly less knockdown of MUC1-CT. Both MDA-MB-468 and BT-20 display a less dramatic decrease of MUC1 extracellular domain compared to MUC1-CT (Figure 1a); this likely represents protein synthesized prior to transfection, and may reflect differences in the turnover rates of the two subunits.
Analysis of the MUC1 extracellular domain by flow cytometry confirms that both cell lines substantially decrease MUC1 expression after siRNA (Figure 1b). By flow cytometry, 468.siMUC1 averaged 75% knockdown of MUC1 compared to 468.siLuc; and BT.siMUC1 averaged 50% knockdown relative to BT.siLuc. These effects could be titrated with the concentration of siRNA, were seen as early as 24 hours post-transfection (data not shown) and lasted to at least 96 h post-transfection (Figure 1b). All experiments were conducted within 48 to 96 hours after siRNA transfection. Similar results were obtained using two independent oligonucleotides designed in our lab (data not shown), designated '882' and '956' for the initial codon recognized by each.<br><br>Transcriptional changes are seen after MUC1 siRNA
Recent work indicates that MUC1 may affect transcription both directly via interaction with transcription factors and indirectly (for example, through modulating signaling). To study the effects of MUC1 knockdown in breast cancer cell lines, real-time PCR arrays were used to analyze transcription of 84 genes implicated in cancer. Only genes with greater than two-fold change were considered. Three genes (MAP2K1, VEGF, PDGFA) were altered two-fold or more after MUC1 siRNA in both MDA-MB-468 and BT-20 cells (Figure 2); two genes (ITGAV, MMP2) changed only in 468.siMUC1; and five genes (TIMP3, RAF1, JUN, TNF, CDC25A) only in BT.siMUC1. This list represents all genes affected greater than two-fold after MUC1 siRNA, rather than a select group. Three genes whose transcription was changed by less than two-fold are shown, two of which (PDGFB and ITGB1) are listed because they relate closely to genes altered by two-fold (PDGFA and ITGAV). The third, MYC, is included because western blots confirmed a substantial change at the protein level (Figure 3a) that may reflect both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation.
Interestingly, transcription of MAP2K1 was decreased in both cell lines after MUC1 siRNA. This gene encodes MEK1, one of the primary regulators of the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway [33], a network that has been linked several times to MUC1 [12,34-36]. We examined MEK1 and MEK2 levels by western blot to confirm decreased protein in MUC1 siRNA-treated cells (Figure 3a), and found that not only were total MEK1/2 levels lower in 468.siMUC1 and BT.siMUC1 compared to controls (0.48 and 0.68 relative to siLuc, respectively), but so were the basal amounts of active (phosphorylated) MEK1/2 (pMEK1/2; 0.12 and 0.42 relative to siLuc, respectively). Both 468.siMUC1 and BT.siMUC1 also showed reduced activation of ERK1/2 (dpERK1/2; 0.21 and 0.27 relative to siLuc, respectively), as would be expected with diminished signaling through MEK1/2; total ERK1/2 levels remain unchanged.
As both lines have high levels of EGFR and thus activate the MEK-ERK cascade intensely when stimulated with EGF [37], siRNA-transfected cells were treated with EGF. Notably, MUC1 siRNA impairs this important oncogenic pathway in MDA-MB-468 cells, as 468.siMUC1 display less pMEK1/2 in response to EGF than do 468.siLuc (Figure 3b). Interestingly, EGF treatment of BT-20 cells results in slightly higher pMEK1/2 levels in BT.siMUC1 compared to BT.siLuc. Though this result seems paradoxical in light of decreased MAP2K1 transcription in BT.siMUC1, it likely results from differential functions of Raf isoforms in combination with the increased RAF1 transcription (Figure 2) and protein level (Figure 3a) in these cells. Specifically, B-Raf is thought to be the main activator of MEK under normal conditions; Raf-1 activates MEK in response to stimulus [38]. Thus, it appears that basal pMEK1/2 levels are not greatly affected by Raf-1 overexpression in BT.siMUC1 cells, likely because MEK is regulated primarily by B-Raf under normal growth conditions. In contrast, when the cells are stimulated (EGF), increased Raf-1 levels in BT.siMUC1 leads to heightened pMEK1/2 (Figure 3b).<br><br>MUC1 siRNA increases apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 but not BT-20
We next examined whether MUC1 knockdown and its associated transcriptional alterations would affect overall cellular events. As several of the genes shown in Figure 2 are important in regulating proliferation and survival, and because of the recently described role of MUC1 in modulating apoptosis in response to cellular stresses [20,21,24], we first analyzed whether MUC1 siRNA would alter apoptosis in these lines. Although there was no change in basal apoptosis in either line (Figure 4a), we observed that the cell lines responded differently when trypsinized for re-plating 24 hours after transfection (Figure 4b). Interestingly, 468.siMUC1 cells show greater apoptosis after trypsinization than do 468.siLuc (49.8% versus 34.0%, respectively), while BT-20 cells from both siRNA treatments display similar levels of apoptosis (around 22%).
To examine whether this phenomenon is specific to trypsin treatment or part of a general stress response involving MUC1, we subjected cells to a panel of stresses and measured cell death. In agreement with the patterns seen with trypsinization, BT.siLuc and BT.siMUC1 respond similarly to all treatments (data not shown), while 468.siMUC1 die more readily than 468.siLuc in response to trypsin, G418, hydrogen peroxide, or celecoxib, a chemotherapeutic that targets the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathway (Figure 4c); these data were confirmed with two independent siRNA constructs (data not shown).
Like the MAPK pathway, AKT signaling has been linked to MUC1 in cancer. Although transcription of AKT was not altered in MUC1 siRNA-treated cells, the results of our apoptosis studies prompted us to investigate levels of AKT further. As expected, the total AKT protein level is not greatly changed after MUC1 siRNA in either cell line, though the active form (pAKT) is increased in both 468.siMUC1 and BT.siMUC1 compared to controls (Figure 3a). This result disagrees with MUC1 activation of the AKT pathway in <span class="yellow">rat</span> 3Y1 cells [18], and may reflect regulation more appropriate to breast cancer cells; this is supported by activation of AKT in response to MUC1 siRNA in other lines [21]. In addition, there is a striking difference in the relative amounts of AKT and pAKT in the two cell lines (Figure 4d). When lysates from both lines are exposed to film for the same length of time (overexposure masks the differences between BT.siLuc and BT.siMUC1 that are apparent in Figure 3a), it is clear that pAKT levels are much higher in BT-20 than in MDA-MB-468, despite lower total AKT expression. This difference in AKT activation between MDA-MB-468 and BT-20 likely contributes to the disparity in their sensitivity to the increased apoptosis expected with loss of MUC1.<br><br>MUC1 siRNA alters proliferation and invasion
As MUC1 is involved in apoptosis, we next analyzed its effects on proliferation. BrdU and [3H]thymidine incorporation were used to analyze proliferation after MUC1 siRNA. 468.siMUC1 cells show a significant decrease in [3H]thymidine incorporation compared to 468.siLuc, while intriguingly, BT.siMUC1 cells show a significant increase in proliferation (Figure 5a). Growth curves mirror these results, as do experiments with the two independent MUC1 siRNA oligonucleotides (data not shown). Note that these assays require trypsinizing cells 24 hours post-transfection; therefore, the results in the MDA-MB-468 line could stem from the changes in apoptosis described in the previous section, rather than a true effect on proliferation. To control for this, we incubated non-trypsinized, siRNA-transfected cells at similar confluence with BrdU to measure incorporation. The 'clumped' profile of cells (contrast to Figure 4b) is likely a result of the acid denaturation (recommended by the antibody manufacturer), as it occurs uniformly in these experiments. BrdU incorporation (Figure 5b) confirms that the [3H]thymidine results are not solely due to alterations in apoptosis, as 468.siMUC1 cells incorporate less BrdU than 468.siLuc; once again, BT.siMUC1 cells show increased proliferation over BT.siLuc.
Given the role of MUC1 in adhesion, we examined whether MUC1 siRNA affects cellular invasion. In transwell assays, BT-20 cells invaded poorly, regardless of the siRNA used (data not shown). However, MDA-MB-468 cells invade more readily, and were analyzed on a panel of three different extracellular matrix proteins. Interestingly, 468.siMUC1 cells display somewhat decreased invasion on collagen IV, laminin, and fibronectin matrices, and on a no-matrix control (Figure 5c), which is in agreement with the trend towards decreased metastasis observed in Muc1-/- × <span class="yellow">MMTV</span>-PyV MT <span class="yellow">mice</span> [8].<br><br>Transfection of MUC1 rescues the 468.siMUC1 phenotype
To determine if the above effects are specific to MUC1, we created stable transfectants of the MDA-MB-468 line using empty vector (468.Neo) or a full-length MUC1 construct (468.MUC1Δ8) that is resistant to one of the independent MUC1-directed oligonucleotides ('882'). These cells were maintained in G418-containing medium to retain transgene selection. As expected, 468.MUC1Δ8 cells show higher levels of both the MUC1 extracellular domain and the MUC1-CT than do 468.Neo (Figure 6a). Note that 468.Neo have MUC1 expression comparable to parental MDA-MB-468; the exposures in Figure 6a are lighter than those in Figure 1a, in order to clearly show the relative levels of MUC1 in the stable transfectants. After MUC1 siRNA, 468.MUC1Δ8 lose some MUC1 (likely endogenous protein, which is not siRNA-resistant) but retain high-level expression, while 468.Neo show a decrease in MUC1 levels similar to parental 468.siMUC1 cells (Figures 6a,b). The difference in the amount of MUC1 knockdown between 468.Neo and 468.MUC1Δ8 is highlighted by the purple shading in Figure 6b.
BrdU incorporation (Figure 6c) indicates that 468.Neo show decreased nucleotide incorporation after MUC1 siRNA compared to control (3.3% versus 25.0%, respectively); this is not seen in 468.MUC1Δ8 cells, which show similar levels of BrdU incorporation regardless of the siRNA used (21.5% for luciferase, 23.9% for MUC1). 468.Neo cells display a more dramatic decrease in BrdU incorporation after MUC1 siRNA than what is seen in parental 468.siMUC1 cells, which may reflect the additional stress of being maintained in G418-containing medium. Similarly, analysis of apoptosis in trypsinized cells indicates that the increased apoptosis seen in parental 468.siMUC1 cells is also present in the 468.Neo line after MUC1 siRNA (Figure 6d; 43.6% in control versus 59.6% in MUC1 siRNA). However, in 468.MUC1Δ8 cells, the level of apoptosis after luciferase siRNA (34.1%) is lower than that in 468.Neo cells; MUC1 siRNA increases the amount of apoptosis slightly (42.8%), restoring it to a level similar to that seen in luciferase siRNA-treated 468.Neo cells. Together, these studies suggest that the above-described results are specific to MUC1, as stable transfection of an siRNA-resistant MUC1 rescues the phenotype seen in 468.siMUC1 cells.<br><br>
Discussion
This report describes both the transcriptional alterations seen after transfection with MUC1 siRNA in <span class="yellow">human</span> breast cancer cells and the effects on events such as apoptosis and proliferation. The two cell lines used (MDA-MB-468 and BT-20) were chosen for high expression of MUC1 and a substantial (50% to 75%), consistent decrease in MUC1 expression after siRNA. Both lines have epithelial morphology, form tumors slowly in <span class="blue">nude mice</span> [37], have mutant p53 [39,40], express EGFR [37], and lack estrogen receptor α [41]. One striking difference between these lines, however, is their response to MUC1 siRNA. MDA-MB-468 cells behave as expected for loss of an oncogene: MUC1 siRNA correlates with increased apoptosis in response to stress, decreased proliferation, and reduced invasion. In contrast, BT.siMUC1 cells proliferate more rapidly than BT.siLuc cells with little effect on apoptosis.
Much of the phenotype of these cells can be understood in light of protein levels and transcriptional activity after MUC1 siRNA. As mentioned, both MDA-MB-468 and BT-20 display increased pAKT after MUC1 siRNA, but the ratio of active to total AKT is considerably higher in the BT-20 line, which may help these cells resist the increased apoptosis expected with loss of MUC1. Myc levels are also higher in both cell lines after MUC1 siRNA, although the ability of Myc to promote proliferation and apoptosis in different cellular contexts [42] complicates the interpretation of this finding.
Both cell lines show reduced transcription of VEGF, PDGFA, PDGFB, and MAP2K1 (MEK1) after MUC1 siRNA. The genes encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the A and B chains of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-A and PDGF-B) are interesting as these proteins have been heavily implicated in angiogenesis, suggesting a novel function for MUC1 in regulating this process. Vascular endothelial growth factor expression in cancer is linked to tumor growth and metastasis [43,44]; platelet-derived growth factor is also angiogenic, but has an additional role in stimulating desmoplasia [45]. Reduced transcription of these genes after MUC1 siRNA suggests that MUC1 may foster angiogenesis and stromal proliferation, although this must be confirmed in a more appropriate model system.
Decreased MAP2K1 (MEK1) transcription after MUC1 siRNA provides a novel mechanism by which MUC1 can affect the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway. MUC1 has often been linked to the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade [12,34-36,46], and at least two mechanisms by which MUC1 can alter MAPK signaling have been described: MUC1 interaction with and phosphorylation by the EGFR family [12,13], and MUC1 binding to the Grb2/Sos complex that activates Ras [46]. Reduction of MEK1 levels after MUC1 siRNA agrees with the role of MUC1 in strengthening MAPK signaling, and indicates that MUC1 can regulate both the transcription and activity of members of this pathway.
Two additional MAPK pathway members are altered specifically in BT.siMUC1, with no corresponding change in 468.siMUC1 cells. These genes are RAF1 and JUN which are increased and decreased, respectively, after MUC1 siRNA. Raf-1 and c-Jun both function outside of the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway, which may explain the seeming paradox of increased RAF1 transcription with simultaneous decreases in MAP2K1 and JUN. Specifically, Raf-1 can inhibit ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulated kinase 1) upstream of p38 and JNK (Jun N-terminal kinase) [38]. ASK1 phosphorylates JNK in response to stress, resulting in activation of c-Jun and stimulation of apoptosis [47], indicating that the coordinate up-regulation of RAF1 and down-regulation of JUN may provide a potent anti-apoptotic effect in BT.siMUC1.
Regulation of life and death is also a hallmark of the CDC25A and TNF gene products. CDC25A is a phosphatase that stimulates cell cycle progression [48], thus the effects of its decrease in BT.siMUC1 are unclear in light of the increased proliferation of these cells. However, the CDC25 proteins (A, B, and C) were recently shown to have greater functional overlap than was previously thought [49], suggesting that the other two isoforms may compensate for reduced CDC25A levels. TNF encodes tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, known for its potent, cell type-specific control of life and death. In tumor cells, TNFα expression can promote proliferation and inhibit apoptosis [50], suggesting that increased TNF transcription in BT.siMUC1 could contribute to the increased proliferation seen in these cells.
Interestingly, the increase in TNF is accompanied by decreased transcription of TIMP3, encoding tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)3. The TIMP family disrupts the function of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), generally resulting in decreased invasion [51]. TIMP3 is unique in that it can also inhibit TNFα converting enzyme (TACE), which activates TNFα by cleaving it from the cell surface [50]. Reduced expression of TIMP3 would, therefore, foster signaling through TNFα by releasing inhibition of TNFα converting enzyme. In agreement with this, TIMP3 can promote apoptosis [52]; thus, its down-regulation in BT.siMUC1 provides another mechanism by which these cells are able to resist the increased apoptosis expected with loss of MUC1.
Another TIMP target responds to MUC1 siRNA, as 468.siMUC1 cells show significantly increased expression of MMP2 (encoding MMP-2/gelatinase A), the product of which degrades type IV collagen [52]. In breast cancer, the ratio of active to latent MMP-2 increases with tumor progression; MMP-2 may facilitate both angiogenesis and metastasis [52]. Its increase after loss of MUC1 is, therefore, unexpected, but at least two factors may clarify this result. First, though MMP-2 levels are increased in <span class="yellow">mouse</span> mammary tumors, its expression is confined to the stroma [53], suggesting that increased MMP2 transcription after loss of the epithelium-specific MUC1 might reflect a shift towards a more mesenchymal phenotype. Second, MMP-2 levels are increased by overexpression of erbB2 [52]; previous studies have shown that erbB2 and Muc1 expression are mutually exclusive in mammary tumors [27], implying that MMP2 might be part of a transcriptional profile linked to low MUC1 levels.
It is intriguing that, despite increased MMP2 transcription, invasion is decreased in 468.siMUC1 cells, even on collagen IV. This may reflect insufficient activation of MMP-2, as the precursor protein must be cleaved for enzymatic function [52]. Alternatively, the slowed invasion of these cells may relate to impaired adhesion resulting from decreased transcription of ITGAV and ITGB1 (αv and β1 integrins, respectively). Integrin signaling is tied to life-or-death decisions in epithelial cells, and integrin expression is vital for processes from wound healing to metastasis [54]. Integrin αvβ3 is implicated in facilitating metastasis of breast cancer cells to bone [55]; decreased transcription of ITGAV after MUC1 siRNA may, therefore, suggest that MUC1 is involved in this lethal process as well.
The MUC1 oncogene has been linked to apoptosis [18,20,26], proliferation [17], and transcription [21,23-25] in cancer. However, the two cell lines chosen for our study display very different responses to MUC1 siRNA, indicating that regulation of MUC1 in breast cancer is likely quite complex and cautioning against over-generalization of results from individual cell lines. Previous reports suggest that, though most studies outline a clearly oncogenic role for MUC1 in breast cancer, the exact details may vary depending on factors such as cell type and signaling context. For example, MUC1 stimulates Fas-mediated apoptosis in CHO cells [26], quite unlike the inhibition of apoptosis seen in other cell lines. Similarly, though MUC1 drives mammary oncogenesis in its own right [9] and facilitates tumorigenesis driven by other oncogenes [7,8], Muc1 is selectively down-regulated in c-neu-induced <span class="yellow">mouse</span> mammary tumors [27], indicating that the context of oncogenic signaling is vital to understanding the function of MUC1.
Thus, it is important to consider the relative levels of knockdown of MUC1 in the two cell lines: BT-20 cells reduce MUC1 expression after siRNA less strongly than do MDA-MB-468 (50% versus 75% knockdown, respectively). As MUC1 serves as a scaffold [11], overexpression of MUC1 relative to its associated signaling proteins might create a dilution effect, sequestering signal transducers away from each other; this would be relieved by MUC1 siRNA. Thus, enough MUC1 may be retained in BT.siMUC1 cells for its oncogenic effects, while signaling complex formation would be enhanced by lowering the amount of MUC1 relative to other signaling proteins.<br><br>Conclusion
The contrast between the MDA-MB-468 and BT-20 lines in response to MUC1 siRNA serves as a reminder that simplified models such as cell lines fail to encompass the complexity of intact biological systems. This report describes transcriptional alterations seen after MUC1 knockdown: decreased transcription of MAP2K1, VEGF, PDGFA, ITGAV, TIMP3, CDC25A, and JUN, and increased transcription of MMP2, TNF, and RAF1. The alterations in MAP2K1, RAF1, and JUN represent a novel means by which MUC1 can affect ERK1/2 signaling: transcriptional regulation of MAPK pathway members. Oncogenic events are also altered in both cell lines after MUC1 siRNA. These results strengthen the growing ties linking MUC1 and transcriptional regulation, and suggest that the role of MUC1 in breast cancer may be more complex than a direct correlation between MUC1 level and oncogenic function.<br><br>Abbreviations
