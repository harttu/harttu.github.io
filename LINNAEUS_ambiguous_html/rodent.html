Abstract
Background
Although a long latency period of toxicity after exposure to methylmercury (MeHg) is known to exist in <span class="yellow">humans</span>, few animal studies have addressed this issue. Substantiation of delayed MeHg toxicity in animals would affect the risk evaluation of MeHg.<br><br>Objectives
Our goal in this study was to demonstrate the existence of a latency period in a <span class="red">rodent</span> model in which the toxicity of perinatal MeHg exposure becomes apparent only later in life. Our study included metallothionein (MT) knockout <span class="yellow">mice</span> because studies have suggested the potential susceptibility of this strain to the neurodevelopmental toxicity of MeHg.<br><br>Methods
Pregnant MT-null and wild-type C57Bl/6J <span class="yellow">mice</span> were exposed to MeHg through their diet containing 5 μg Hg/g during gestation and early lactation. We examined behavioral functions of the offspring using frequently used paradigms, including open field behavior (OPF), passive avoidance (PA), and the Morris water maze (MM), at ages of 12–13 and 52–53 weeks.<br><br>Results
At 12 weeks of age, behavioral effects of MeHg were not detected, except for OPF performance in MeHg-exposed MT-null females. At 52 weeks of age, the MeHg-exposed groups showed poorer performance both in PA and MM, and their OPF activity differed from controls. These effects of MeHg appeared exaggerated in the MT-null strain. The brain Hg concentration had leveled off by 13 weeks of age.<br><br>Conclusions
The results suggest the existence of a long latency period after perinatal exposure to low-level MeHg, in which the behavioral effects emerged long after the leveling-off of brain Hg levels. Hence, the initial toxicologic event responsible for the late effects should have occurred before this leveling-off of brain Hg.<br><br><br><br>Methylmercury (MeHg) poses serious and practical concerns for <span class="yellow">human</span> populations regarding perinatal exposure. Fish, especially large predator (carnivore) fish species, accumulate high concentrations of MeHg through the marine food chain, and exposure of pregnant <span class="yellow">women</span> to MeHg through the consumption of fish has evoked widespread concern due to potential effects on offspring. Two large-scale cohort studies in fish-eating populations of Seychelles and Faroe islanders are being conducted; although the former has not found consistent adverse developmental effects of MeHg (Myers et al. 2007), the latter has reported adverse effects (Debes et al. 2006). Fundamental reasons for this discrepancy have not been completely elucidated, and many questions remain regarding the neurotoxicity of MeHg, despite extensive study.
Among the unanswered questions is whether there is a long latency period for behavioral manifestations after exposure to MeHg (Clarkson and Magos 2006; Landrigan et al. 2005; Rice 1996; Weiss et al. 2005a, 2005b). Typical examples of latent toxicity in <span class="yellow">humans</span>, including both acute and chronic MeHg exposures, have been described in detail elsewhere (Weiss et al. 2005a). Davidson et al. (2006) recently suggested that effects of perinatal exposure to MeHg may emerge 9 years after birth in the Seychelles cohort. Consequently, risk assessments of MeHg exposure could be inaccurate because studies (<span class="yellow">human</span> or animal) usually do not focus on later stages of life and therefore could miss delayed effects. The possibility of delayed toxicity is exemplified by the expanded Barker hypothesis, which posits that the origin of some neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases lies in early exposure to environmental chemicals (Landrigan et al. 2005). Although epidemiologic evidence would be ideal for exploring the possibility of delayed toxicity (and, indeed, data from epidemiologic studies form the basis of current risk assessment for developmental toxicity of MeHg), considering the complex effects of numerous potential confounders and the existence of multiple exposures in <span class="yellow">human</span> populations, animal models would likely make important contributions to this field.
Although numerous animal studies have described the developmental neurotoxicity of MeHg (Watanabe and Satoh, 1996), few have addressed the latency issue. Few studies have evaluated the neurobehavioral effects in rodents longitudinally beyond 6 months after perinatal exposure. Spyker (1975) addressed this issue in her pioneering work, reporting the late development of behavioral toxicity in <span class="yellow">mice</span> prenatally exposed to MeHg; it appeared, however, that the substantial mortality and retarded growth among the exposed <span class="yellow">mice</span> were apparent before weaning, indicating that the doses used (even though some lower dose levels were included) exerted severe toxicity. Using a relatively complex schedule-controlled operant behavior method, <span class="yellow">rats</span> whose parents were exposed to MeHg (0.5 or 6.4 mg/L) from 4 weeks before mating and continuing to postnatal day (PND) 16 were shown to be less sensitive to a change in the reinforcement schedule than were their nonexposed counterparts at 28–32 months of age (Newland et al. 2004). <span class="yellow">Mice</span> that were perinatally exposed to 1 or 3 mg/L MeHg in drinking water did not show significant deviation from controls in behavioral performance (motor performance, memory, and learning) at 5, 15, or 26 months of age, but the lifetime-exposed groups did show a significant deviation (Weiss et al. 2005c). The existence of a latency period (i.e., the absence of effects earlier in life followed by the emergence of effects at a later stage of life) has not been demonstrated in any <span class="red">rodent</span> study. In nonhuman primates, delayed emergence of the signs of neurotoxicity was observed several years after the cessation of a 7-year postnatal exposure (Rice 1996).
Metallothionein (MT) protects against the toxicities of a variety of metals. We examined the neurotoxicity and developmental toxicity of metallic Hg in MT I/II-knockout <span class="yellow">mice</span> (Yoshida et al. 2004) and demonstrated the susceptibility of this genetically manipulated strain to the toxicity of metallic Hg. In contrast to metallic Hg, MeHg does not induce MT, and MT would not substantially influence the kinetics of MeHg (Yasutake et al. 1998). Several reports, however, have demonstrated protective effects of MT against MeHg toxicity, which was ascribed to the radical scavenging effect of MT (Yao et al. 2000). We also showed that perinatal exposure to MeHg results in altered metabolism of thyroid hormones in neonates that was more distinct in MT-null strains than their wild-type counterparts (Mori et al. 2006). The vulnerability of the MT-null strain suggests that delayed neurobehavioral toxicity due to MeHg, if it does exist, might be more distinctive in this strain.
By utilizing the MT-null strain, we aimed to answer the following two questions: First, could we generate a model in which the toxicity of MeHg would emerge or at least become exaggerated later in life as opposed to earlier in life (i.e., at 3–6 months, which was the timing for most of the earlier studies that used behavioral evaluations)? Second, would the MT-null strain be affected more than its parent C57BL strain? Answering either of these questions not only could influence the risk evaluation of MeHg, but it could also lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of toxicity for perinatal MeHg exposure. To address these issues, we used three behavioral paradigms, the open field (OPF), passive avoidance (PA), and Morris (water) maze (MM) tests, which are often used in this field and which we used in our previous studies on the effects of Hg vapor (Yoshida et al. 2004, 2006). Performances in the MM and PA are said to be the most sensitive to aging (Gower and Lamberty 1993).
We used a dose of 5 μg MeHg/g in the diet, which resulted in a brain Hg level relevant to <span class="yellow">human</span> risk assessment. We evaluated the behavioral end points twice, once around 3 months of age and the other time around 1 year; the latter time roughly corresponds to the period when many behavioral performances, including OPF (Acevedoa et al. 2006; Carrie et al. 1999; Gower and Lamberty 1993), PA (Gower and Lamberty 1993), and MM (Bach et al. 1999; Carrie et al. 1999), show alterations in this <span class="yellow">mouse</span> strain.
Materials and Methods
Animals and MeHg exposure
OLA129/C57BL/6J strain <span class="yellow">mice</span> (wild type) and MT I/II-knockout <span class="yellow">mice</span> (MT-null) of this strain were provided by K.H. Choo of the Murdoch Institute, Parkville, Australia (Michalska and Choo 1993) and were of a mixed genetic background of 129/Ola and C57BL/6 strains. F1 hybrid <span class="yellow">mice</span> were mated with C57BL/6 <span class="yellow">mice</span> for six generations at the National Institute for Environmental Studies (Tsukuba, Japan). At 10 weeks of age, single male and female <span class="yellow">mice</span> were allowed to cohabit; every female <span class="yellow">mouse</span> was checked each morning for the presence of a vaginal plug. When a plug was confirmed, the day was designated as day 0 of gestation (GD0).
The diet, NIH-07PLD formula (CLEA Japan, Inc., Tokyo, Japan), contained vitamins and trace elements as follows (per kilogram diet): 3.2 mg CuSO4, 88 mg FeSO4, 149 mg MnSO4, 25 mg ZnCO3, 1.6 mg Ca(IO3)2, 11 mg vitamin B1, 4.7 mg vitamin B2, 1.9 mg vitamin B6, 44 mg vitamin E, in addition to 5 μg MeHg/g. This diet was fed to the pregnant <span class="yellow">mice</span> starting from GD0 through 10 days after delivery (i.e., PND10). Thereafter, we switched <span class="yellow">mice</span> to a diet that did not contain MeHg. We chose GD0 as the beginning of exposure because exposures that started before conception often resulted in fairly high Hg concentrations in fetal/neonatal brains (Kakita et al. 2003), and we chose PND10 to cover the early neonatal period, in which considerable brain growth occurs. In our experimental setting, the neonatal <span class="yellow">mice</span> started to eat from the diet bucket and drink from the water bottle from PND10 onward. Control <span class="yellow">mice</span> were kept on the same diet but without MeHg (< 0.01 μg Hg/g). On PND1, to avoid the confounding effects due to different litter size, we reduced each litter to six pups (three males and three females when possible), and on PND10, two males and two females from each litter were killed for chemical analyses.
The remaining male and female offspring per litter were weaned on PND28 and used for subsequent behavioral analyses (either at 12–13 weeks or 52–53 weeks, depending on the litter) as described below. We measured body weights of the weaned <span class="yellow">mice</span> every 2 weeks. Thus, four experimental groups were used (with or without MeHg exposure for two strains), and each group consisted of 12–13 litters. For half of the litters, the behavioral analyses were conducted at 12–13 weeks of age, and upon completion of the behavioral analyses, the animals were killed under ether anesthesia. We then dissected the organs (brain, liver, and kidneys) for Hg analyses. For the remaining half of the litters, we conducted the behavioral tests at 52–53 weeks of age. The <span class="yellow">mice</span> were treated humanely and with regard to alleviation of suffering according to the National Institute for Environmental Studies’ Guidelines for Animal Welfare and the guidelines of St. Marianna University.<br><br>Behavioral evaluations
The details of each behavioral procedure have been described elsewhere (Yoshida et al. 2006). Brief descriptions follow.
For the OPF test, we used an OPF apparatus (Ohara Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with a 60 × 60-cm floor surrounded by walls 60 cm high. The experimental room light was turned off, and a dim light of 80 lux was lit during the experiment. We placed a <span class="yellow">mouse</span> in the center of the floor and monitored its behavior for 10 min using a CCD camera connected to a computer. The position of the center of gravity was calculated by image-analyzing software, which was used to calculate the total distance traveled by the <span class="yellow">mouse</span> as well as the positional preference (either center or peripheral, where peripheral was defined as the area within 10 cm from the wall). We cleaned the OPF apparatus with 70% ethanol between trials.
The apparatus for the PA test (Ohara Co. Ltd.) consisted of a light compartment that illuminated by a 400-lux light and a dark compartment with black opaque walls and lids. The two compartments were separated by a mobile guillotine door. On the first day (training trial), we placed each <span class="yellow">mouse</span> in the light compartment facing away from the guillotine door, which was closed. After 30 sec of introduction, the door was opened; when the <span class="yellow">mouse</span> entered the dark compartment, a brief electric shock (4 mA for 2 sec) was delivered through the metal grid floor. This would force the <span class="yellow">mouse</span> back to the light component. The interval between the opening of the door and the entry to the dark room (in seconds) was recorded and defined as the latency. On the next day, the same procedure was repeated, but without the electric shock (retaining trail). In this PA paradigm, aversive learning was assumed to be established in the training trial, and we used its retention in the retaining trail as the index of learning. Between each individual trial, we cleaned the apparatus with ethanol. The cutoff time of the retention session was 300 sec.
The MM test apparatus (Ohara Co., Ltd.) was a round-shaped water pool with a diameter of 120 cm. A small platform was submerged in the water, which provided a place for <span class="yellow">mice</span> to escape from the water (i.e., an aversive stimulus, water temperature = 23 ± 1°C). The water was made opaque by adding white paint so that the <span class="yellow">mouse</span> could not see the submerged platform. In each trial, we released a <span class="yellow">mouse</span> into the pool from a determined position along the wall, and the performance of the <span class="yellow">mouse</span> was monitored by a CCD camera/image analyzer. The time required to reach the platform was recorded. If a <span class="yellow">mouse</span> could not find the platform within 60 sec after release, it was led to the platform and placed on it for 20 sec before being removed. In these cases, a latency of 60 sec was recorded. We conducted the trial once a day up to the fifth day for each <span class="yellow">mouse</span>, and the order of each <span class="yellow">mouse</span> was counterbalanced across the day. On the sixth day, a transfer test (or probe test), which is a trial without the platform, was conducted; in this procedure, we counted the number of times that the <span class="yellow">mouse</span> crossed the position where the platform had been.<br><br>Tissue Hg concentration
The tissue samples were homogenized (10% weight/volume) in distilled water using a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica GmbH, Littau, Switzerland). We determined Hg levels in the homogenates by the oxygen combustion–gold amalgamation method (Ohkawa et al. 1977) using an atomic absorption Hg detector MD-1 (Nippon Instruments, Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan). To ensure the accuracy of the measurement, we included reference material from a dogfish (DORM-2; National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) with a certified value of 4.64 ± 0.26 μg/g in the analyses; the observed values fell within the certified range. The detection limit of the measurement was 0.1 ng Hg.<br><br>Statistics
We analyzed behavioral data for OPF and PA by analysis of variance (ANOVA), taking sex, strain, and MeHg exposure as the factors. All the interactions among these factors were put into the model. When any of the interactions was highly significant, we analyzed the data separately in an appropriate way; for example, if sex × Hg was significant, the data for males and females were separately analyzed for the effects of strain and Hg. Whenever appropriate, ANOVAs were followed by Mann-Whitney U or Student’s t-tests, depending on the nature and distribution of the variables. We analyzed data for the MM by repeated-measures ANOVA, taking the exposure as between-group and trials as within-group variables. The test was performed for each of the four sex and strain combinations separately. The significance level was set at p < 0.05.<br><br>
Results
Body weight
Up to 20 weeks of age, the body weight values of the control and MeHg-exposed groups were not different, regardless of strain or sex. After 28 weeks, except for the wild-type female groups, the MeHg-exposed groups weighed significantly less than the controls (Figure 1).<br><br>OPF
At 12 weeks of age, a three-way ANOVA of the locomotion distance revealed that only strain was a significant factor (p < 0.001), reflecting the longer distance traveled by the MT-null <span class="yellow">mice</span> (Figure 2A). Strain was also a significant factor for the proportion of the central-area locomotion (Figure 3A), and Hg exposure marginally affected this outcome. In MT-null females, the proportion of central-area locomotion was higher in MeHg-exposed <span class="yellow">mice</span> than in the controls; this difference was not observed in any other strain–sex combination. At 52 weeks of age, the strain × Hg interaction was highly significant (p < 0.001) in an ANOVA of locomotion distance (Figure 2B); MeHg exposure was associated with decreased locomotion distance in wild-type <span class="yellow">mice</span> and with increased distance in MT-null <span class="yellow">mice</span>. A strain-wise two-way ANOVA (with sex and Hg as the factors) revealed that only Hg was significant in both strains (p < 0.01). Regarding the proportion of the central-area locomotion, the effects of MeHg appeared to depend on sex [i.e., sex × Hg was highly significant (p < 0.001) in the three-way ANOVA; Figure 3B]. Indeed, a sex-wise two-way ANOVA showed significant effects of Hg only in females (p < 0.001).<br><br>PA
At 12 weeks of age, all the groups showed prolonged latency in the second (retention) trial, and no consistent effect of MeHg was recognized regardless of strain or sex (Figure 4A).
At 52 weeks of age, a three-way ANOVA revealed a significant interaction between strain and Hg (p < 0.05); strain-wise two-way ANOVAs revealed a significant effect of Hg on learning in MT-null <span class="yellow">mice</span> of both sexes; these groups of <span class="yellow">mice</span> showed significantly shorter (less than half) latency times compared to control <span class="yellow">mice</span> (Figure 4B). A notable difference between the results at 52 weeks of age and those at 12 weeks was that many of the tested <span class="yellow">mice</span> exceeded the cutoff time in the retention trials at 52 weeks, except for the MT-null groups.<br><br>MM
At 13 weeks of age, repeated-measures ANOVA did not indicate any effects of MeHg (Figure 5A). At 52 weeks of age (Figure 5B), wild-type males and MT-null females shared the same statistical results; Hg as well as the Hg × trial interaction were statistically significant. Thus, in both cases, the MeHg groups showed a longer latency, hampering learning performance.<br><br>Tissue Hg concentration
At PND10, which was immediately after the exposure, brain Hg concentrations of the neonatal <span class="yellow">mice</span> were approximately ≤ 0.5 μg/g (Table 1). Although the MT-null <span class="yellow">mice</span> and females showed slightly higher brain Hg concentrations than the corresponding wild-type group and males, respectively, neither of these differences was significant. At 13 weeks, when the behavioral tests were completed, the brain Hg concentration was comparable to the control (nonexposed) level (approximately 5 ng/g in both the exposed and control brains). Interestingly, MT-null <span class="yellow">mice</span> had a significantly lower brain Hg concentration than the corresponding wild-type groups.<br><br>
Discussion
Results of the present study demonstrate the delayed emergence of neurobehavioral toxicity due to perinatal MeHg exposure, which presumably developed after brain MeHg concentrations had leveled off. This emergent toxicity was exaggerated in MT-null <span class="yellow">mice</span> and was more distinct in females. To our knowledge, our findings show the first clear-cut demonstrations of a long latency period of MeHg neurobehavioral toxicity in rodents and possible genetic susceptibility for the emergent toxicity.
The exposure level should be considered before discussing the end points. On PND10, immediately after the cessation of MeHg exposure, the brain Hg concentration was approximately 0.5 μg/g, regardless of the strain or sex. In a previous study, the brain Hg concentration in <span class="yellow">mice</span> perinatally exposed to 6 mg MeHg/L (via water) peaked between PND0 and PND4 and was approximately three times higher than on PND21 (Goulet et al. 2003). Therefore, the peak brain Hg concentration, which is presumably observed around birth, can be estimated as about 3-fold higher than that on PND10 and would be approximately 1.5 μg/g (0.5 μg/g × 3), which is one of the lowest levels among recent <span class="red">rodent</span> studies. As shown by Sakamoto et al. (2002) in their Figure 2, prenatal exposure of <span class="yellow">rats</span> to MeHg showed a peak brain Hg concentration around PND1 that was four to five times greater than the level on PND10. Also, Newland and Rasmussen (2000) reported a slight alteration of a complex operant behavior in <span class="yellow">rats</span> at ages < 2 years at brain Hg concentrations as low as 0.5 μg/g at birth, although statistical significance of this particular effect was not clear. It should be noted that <span class="yellow">rats</span> have different Hg kinetics (Hirayama and Yasutake 1986; Yasutake and Hirayama 1990) due to the high affinity of <span class="yellow">rat</span> hemoglobin for MeHg (Clarkson and Magos 2006).
The most important observation of the present study was that the effects of low-level MeHg exposure were detected only at later stages in the lives of the <span class="yellow">mice</span>. Except for the central-area occupancy in OPF in MT-null females, no statistically significant effects of MeHg were observed in any of the three behavioral tests at 12 weeks of age. In contrast, significant effects were observed in all three tests at 52 weeks of age. The brain Hg concentration of the exposed groups had leveled off and was not distinguishable from the non-exposed group at 13 weeks of age, immediately after the first phase of the behavioral testing. Therefore, in the present study, there was a latency period in which the dose and effects could not be detected, although effects were observed 9 months later. Another notable observation was that the emergent manifestation of toxicity was also recognized in the suppression of body weight (except for wild-type females), which only became apparent on or after 28 weeks of age.
The existence of a latency period of as long as several years after chronic (7 years from birth), low-level exposure to MeHg has been described in nonhuman primates (Rice 1996). In that case, however, the Hg concentration in the brain remained elevated, presumably as a result of the long exposure. Indeed, Rice (1996) argued that the minute amount of residual brain Hg could have caused the delayed toxicity. This was clearly not the case in the present study because the Hg concentration leveled off around the time of the first phase of the behavioral study. The absence of behavioral effects at 12 weeks of age ruled out the possibility that the residual behavioral effects were due to elevated Hg early in life. Therefore, the behavioral toxicity that surfaced at 52 weeks of age must have had its origin before the brain Hg concentration leveled off (at or before 13 weeks of age), although the redistribution of Hg to the brain from other sites of deposition, such as the liver, cannot be completely excluded. The long silent period before the manifestations of toxicity emerged suggests that a slow process plays a role in this latent toxicity.
Although an example of a slow process is aging, 52 weeks of age might not be sufficiently old for a <span class="yellow">mouse</span> to be considered aged in the physiologic sense because C57BL/6 <span class="yellow">mice</span> have a relatively long life span among <span class="yellow">mouse</span> strains [median survival of 27–31 months (Gower and Lamberty 1993)] and a survival rate at 18–19 months as high as 90% (Institute on Aging HP) (National Institute on Aging 2008). Nevertheless, various behavioral examinations have shown age-related changes in the performance of <span class="yellow">mice</span> at approximately 1 year of age in the OPF (Acevedoa et al. 2006; Carrie et al. 1999), MM (Bach et al. 1999; Carrie et al. 1999), and PA (Gower and Lamberty 1993) tests. The observed effects of MeHg, including the deterioration in the PA and MM and suppression in the OPF (in wild-type <span class="yellow">mice</span>), were consistent with these reported effects of aging on behavioral function (in the sense described above), except for the increased OPF activity in the MT-null <span class="yellow">mice</span>.
Regardless of its neural basis, the basis of neurobehavioral toxicity should be sought in early life stages when the brain Hg concentration is highly elevated (approximately 1.5 μg/g at its peak). Some in vivo experiments have demonstrated several candidate mechanisms of perinatal exposure to MeHg, including abnormal migration of neurons and/or glias (Kakita et al. 2003; Rodier et al. 1984), but at higher Hg concentrations. Using exactly the same exposure protocol as the present study, we found suppressed activity of type III iodo-thyronine deiodinase, a thyroid hormone-metabolizing enzyme, in the brains of PND10 <span class="yellow">mouse</span> neonates (Mori et al. 2006), consistent with our previous study of higher MeHg doses (Watanabe et al. 1999). This perturbation could be one of the candidate mechanisms responsible for the later anomalous behaviors because even a transient change in thyroid hormones during the critical period of perinatal life exerts long-term consequences (Auso et al. 2004).
The effects of MeHg at 52 weeks of age were influenced by two potential modifying factors, sex and strain. In the OPF, while the locomotion was affected in both strains (although the direction was opposite), center occupancy was significantly increased only in the MT-null <span class="yellow">mice</span>. In addition, the effects on PA were significant only in MT-null <span class="yellow">mice</span>, whereas MeHg at a higher dose was reported to worsen PA performance in <span class="yellow">rats</span> (6–8 weeks of age; Sakamoto et al. 2002). In addition, body weight gain was suppressed in both male and female MT-null <span class="yellow">mice</span>, whereas in wild-type <span class="yellow">mice</span> the suppression was observed only in males. Taken together, the MT-null strain appeared to be slightly more susceptible to the late-emergent effects of MeHg. Several lines of evidence have shown that MT-I,II is protective against the toxicity of MeHg (Leiva-Presa et al. 2004; Yao et al. 2000), and the present results were basically consistent with these reports. We have also reported the susceptibility of the MT-null strain to the neurotoxic effects of metallic Hg (Yoshida et al. 2004, 2006).
The difference in the susceptibility to MeHg between sexes is still debated (Clarkson and Magos 2006; National Research Council 2000; Vahter 2007). In the present study, some responses to MeHg were different between the sexes, including OPF performance at 12 and 52 weeks of age and MM performance at 52 weeks. The fact that the MT-null female group was the only group affected by MeHg at 12 weeks may suggest the particular susceptibility of females in this strain. This point needs to be clarified in further experiments.
The question remains of why MT-null <span class="yellow">mice</span> are susceptible to the delayed neurotoxicity of perinatal MeHg. Apparently kinetics play only a minor role because the strain did not show distinct effects on the brain Hg concentration at PND10. The significantly lower brain Hg concentration in MT-null <span class="yellow">mice</span> compared with corresponding wild-type <span class="yellow">mice</span> at 13 weeks of age indicated that MT-I,II might play a significant role in the retention of Hg (or MeHg). This is consistent with the results of studies of metallic Hg exposure (Yoshida et al. 2004, 2005); a lower brain Hg concentration may not guarantee lower toxicity, supporting the protective role of the protein. Earlier studies suggest that brain MT-I,II has an important role both in the response to oxidative injury (Potter et al. 2007) and in the process of aging (Kojima et al. 1999). Therefore, the lack of MT can exaggerate the toxicity of MeHg by enhancing the initial effects due to oxygen radicals and/or by accelerating functional aging. Apart from this, an intriguing possibility is that the brain-specific isoform, MT-III, might contribute to the results we obtained because the expression of MT-III, together with MT-I, is increased in the brain of old <span class="yellow">rats</span>, resulting in the low availability of free zinc for synapses (Mocchegiani et al. 2004). The age-dependent expressions of MT isoforms might be modified in MT-null <span class="yellow">mice</span>.
Results of the present study might allow the possibility of alternative interpretations due to some potentially confounding factors. For example, except for the wild-type females, we observed significant differences in body weight between MeHg-exposed and non-exposed groups. Because these differences only became clear later in life, they might be associated with the toxicity that also emerged later in life. Manipulation of body weight in rodents alters activity levels, although the reported results are not always consistent with each other (Harrison and Archer 1987; Samuelsson et al. 2008). Also, the differential performance in PA could be related with the potential effects of MeHg on (electric) shock sensitivity, which we did not examine. At least one high-dose study with adult <span class="yellow">rats</span> showed reduced electric sensitivity due to mercury exposure (Wu et al. 1985). These possibilities need to be addressed in future studies.
To summarize, the present results suggest that an initial (or triggering) toxicologic event occurs before the brain Hg concentration stabilizes and that the nature of this event should be either an acceleration of the aging process or interaction with the aging process. Thus, by identifying the physiologic events associated with the functional aging of the examined behavioral tasks, the fundamental toxicologic scar might be revealed.<br><br>
<h3>pmcA2652712</h3>Neurogenin2 Directs Granule Neuroblast Production and Amplification while NeuroD1 Specifies Neuronal Fate during Hippocampal Neurogenesis
Abstract
The specification and differentiation of dentate gyrus granule neurons in the hippocampus require temporally and spatially coordinated actions of both intrinsic and extrinsic molecules. The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Neurogenin2 (Ngn2) and NeuroD1 are key regulators in these processes. Based on existing classification, we analyzed the molecular events occurring during hippocampal neurogenesis, primarily focusing on juvenile animals. We found that Ngn2 is transiently expressed by late type-2a amplifying progenitors. The Ngn2 progenies mature into hippocampal granule neurons. Interestingly, the loss of Ngn2 at early stages of development leads to a robust reduction in neurogenesis, but does not disturb granule neuron maturation per se. We found that the role of Ngn2 is to maintain progenitors in an undifferentiated state, allowing them to amplify prior to their maturation into granule neurons upon NeuroD1 induction. When we overexpressed Ngn2 and NeuroD1 in vivo, we found NeuroD1 to exhibit a more pronounced neuron-inductive effect, leading to granule neuron commitment, than that displayed by Ngn2. Finally, we observed that all markers expressed during the transcriptional control of hippocampal neurogenesis in rodents are also present in the <span class="yellow">human</span> hippocampus. Taken together, we demonstrate a critical role of for Ngn2 and NeuroD1 in controlling neuronal commitment and hippocampal granule neuroblast formation, both during embryonic development and in post-natal hippocampal granule neurogenesis.<br><br>Introduction
Neurons are born not only during development of the central nervous system, but neurogenesis also continues into adulthood. In both <span class="blue">rodent</span> and <span class="yellow">human</span> adult brain, neurogenesis is active in two distinct zones of the forebrain: the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) [1]–[5]. The molecular mechanism underlying neurogenesis in the DG is not fully understood. Clearly, a cascade of transcriptional events controls the specification of neuronal identity in the DG [3], [6]–[8], but details of the expression pattern and function of each transcription factor remain elusive.
The paired-box homeodomain transcription factor Pax6 and the bHLH transcription factors Ngn2 and NeuroD1 are important when cells acquire a pan-neuronal character and a specific neuronal subtype [9], [10]. In the developing neocortex, Pax6 is expressed in dividing radial glial cells at the ventricular surface [9]. In the adult hippocampus, Pax6 is expressed in astrocytes in the SGZ and are considered to be the true stem cells [9], [11]. Loss- and gain-of-function studies indicate that Pax6 is involved in regulating the proliferation of neocortical and hippocampal progenitors [9], [12]–[16]. During neocorticogenesis, high concentrations of Pax6 induce the expression of the bHLH transcription factor Neurogenin2 (Ngn2) [17]. In turn, Ngn2 causes cell cycle exit [18], an event that takes place when NeuroD1 starts to be expressed [19]. In the developing hippocampus, the absence of Ngn2 leads to a reduced number of granule neurons [20]. NeuroD1, on the other hand, is essential for the differentiation and survival of hippocampal granule neurons [10]. Interestingly, in the absence of Ngn2, NeuroD1 can still be activated and neuronal differentiation can still take place [20]. This has led to the idea that the primary role of Ngn2 is not to direct neuronal differentiation.
Only a small number of studies have addressed the role of Ngn2 and NeuroD1 in hippocampal neurogenesis [10], [20], [21]. Therefore, we now re-examine their roles in hippocampal neurogenesis in detail, using gain- and loss-of-function experiments. We first establish a hierarchy of transcriptional events that occur during neurogenesis in the DG and then define the place that Ngn2, NeuroD1 and other transcription factors have in this cascade. We find that a lack of Ngn2 expression result in a markedly smaller hippocampus and an almost complete absence of the DG. We show that Ngn2 is required for granule neuroblasts production/amplification. Gain-of-function of NeuroD1 during development of the DG results in an efficient generation of granule neuroblasts, an effect that we do not observe when we overexpress Ngn2. Finally, we demonstrate that the same transcription factors and cellular markers seen in <span class="yellow">mouse</span> and <span class="yellow">rat</span> tissue are also present in the <span class="yellow">human</span> hippocampus.<br><br>Results
Expression of transcription factors and cellular markers define different phases of postnatal hippocampal granule neuron maturation
We first analyzed in detail the chronology of expression of different transcription factors and cell-specific markers during DG granule neuron formation and correlated our findings to the previously established classification of adult hippocampal neurogenesis [3]. The current classification describes hippocampal stem cells and progenies into three categories (type-1, -2 and -3 cells) depending on the markers they express as they mature. In the adult <span class="yellow">mouse</span> DG, only a very small proportion of cells undergo mitosis at any one given time [22]. Consequently, in adult animals it is difficult to analyze which transcription factors are involved in the transition phase from one cell category to the next. Therefore, we studied 2 week-old rodents which have higher numbers of maturing granule neurons in the DG. We performed triple immunohistochemistry for all markers of interest and compared results from 2 week- and 2 month-old <span class="yellow">mice</span> (Figure 1 and figure S1).
We first confirmed that stem cells in the SGZ exhibit characteristics of radial glia [3], [11], [16]. They extend radial processes from the SGZ to the apex of the subgranular layer (SGL) and the basal molecular layer. Moreover, they express the intermediate filament protein nestin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and glial glutamate transporter (GLAST) [16] (Figure 1A and B and figure S1A and S1B). The GFAP- and GLAST+ cells are defined as type-1 cells [3]. They also express the paired-homeodomain transcription factor Pax6 (Figure 1B). These radial glia-like stem cells divide relatively infrequently, and are believed to undergo symmetric division (giving rise to two identical stem cells) under some conditions. They can also divide asymmetrically and give rise to a new stem cell and one neuronal progenitor, which usually is defined as a type-2 cell (Figure 2B) [3].
Type-2 cells are divided into two different populations: type-2a expressing nestin and type-2b co-expressing nestin and doublecortin (Dcx) [23]. Based on a previous report [24], we examined the expression pattern of the T-domain transcription factors Tbr1 and Tbr2. We found that Tbr2 is expressed in type-2a cells, in agreement with a recent report [25]. In the SGZ of 2 week-old <span class="yellow">mice</span>, we found an average of 50–70 Tbr2+ cells per 30 µm-thick section throughout the rostro-caudal axis of the dorsal hippocampus. This number was reduced by 35% in 2 month-old <span class="yellow">mice</span> (Figure 1C with figure S1C and data not shown). As opposed to Tbr1 (Figure 1D and figure S1D), Tbr2+ cells did not co-express Dcx or PSA-NCAM (Figure 1C and figure S1C). We observed that Tbr1-immuoreactivity gradually decreased as neurons matured and started to express NeuN (Figure 1H and figure S1H). Thus, Tbr2 labels type-2 cells, while Tbr1 is expressed by immature granule neurons.
We then examined the molecular phenotype of type-3 cells, a cell type that transiently expresses Calretinin [26]. We hypothesized that hippocampal type-3 cells might also express the bHLH transcription factor NeuroD1, known to partially overlap with Tbr2 and Tbr1 in different brain regions [24]. We found that NeuroD1 expression in the hippocampus starts in Tbr2+ cells and extends to post-mitotic Tbr1+ cells, which also express the hippocampal granule identity transcription factor Prox1 (Figure 1G and 1I and figure S1G and S1I). While Tbr1 expression ceases during granule maturation, that of NeuroD1 is weakly maintained when NeuN expression starts (Figure 1G and 1H and figure S1G and S1H). We found that calretinin expression decreased during granule neuron maturation, before NeuroD1 was reduced (Figure 1F). Thus NeuroD1 is expressed in type-2b and type-3 cells, as well as immature granule neurons. Finally, we found that NeuroD2 starts to be expressed just after NeuroD1 and, unlike NeuroD1, continues to be highly expressed in mature neurons (Figure 1J and data not shown).<br><br>Mash1 and Ngn2 define the early versus late type-2a stage in 2 weeks old <span class="yellow">mice</span>
Having established the hierarchy of transcription factors and cellular markers appearing during hippocampal neurogenesis, we set out to clarify the position of the two bHLH transcription factors Ngn2 and Mash1, in this process. We found that more than 90% of Ngn2-immunoreactive cells are Pax6 positive (Figure 2A), and almost all co-express Tbr2 (Figure 2B). Thus, Ngn2 appears to be expressed by type-2a cells. As our antibodies against Ngn2 and NeuroD1 were made in the same species, we could not determine if there was an overlap between these two proteins. However, by comparing their overlapping expression pattern with that of Tbr2, we propose that some Ngn2+ cells co-express NeuroD1, and that they appear at the onset of NeuroD1 expression and downregulation of Ngn2. We base this assumption on the facts that more than 50% of the Tbr2+ cells are Ngn2+ and more than 50% of Tbr2+ cells also express NeuroD1. The expression of Ngn2 in adult hippocampus was hard to detect using immunohistochemistry due to the low expression of the protein (data not shown). However, it is present, as previously described using reporter <span class="yellow">mice</span> and as revealed by in situ hybridization [21].
We next examined the expression of Mash1 and compared it with that of Ngn2, Pax6 and Tbr2. We found some Mash1+ cells (10–20 cells per section) in the dorsal hippocampus. Almost all of them co-expressed Pax6 (Figure 2C). Only few cells co-expressed Tbr2 (Figure 2D) or Ngn2 (Figure 2E), suggesting that Mash1 is downregulated when these two proteins are expressed. None of the Mash1-expressing cells were positive for NeuroD1 (Figure 2F). Mash1+ cells were still undergoing mitosis (Figure 2C) and consequently over 90% of them co-labeled with the cell-cycle marker Ki67 (Figure S1J).
Taken together, we show that Mash1 and Ngn2 are expressed in early and late stages of maturation of type2a progenitors, respectively, and that both transcription factors are co-expressed briefly when cells transit from early to late phase type2a cells.<br><br>Ngn2 progenies become hippocampal granule neurons
Previous work has shown that in Mash1 null mutant <span class="yellow">mice</span> hippocampal neurogenesis is not reduced and the hippocampus is not malformed [20]. Therefore we focused our initial analysis on the role of Ngn2 in hippocampal neurogenesis. We characterized the fate of Ngn2-expressing cells using Ngn2 Knock-in green fluorescent protein (GFP) <span class="yellow">mice</span> (Ngn2+/GFP) [27]. In the SGZ of 2 week-old hippocampi, we found bright GFP-expressing cells that were positive for Tbr2 (Figure 2H), the immature neuronal marker PSA-NCAM (Figure 2I) and NeuroD1 (Figure 2J). Furthermore, Prox1+, NeuroD2+ and calretinin+ cells were also weakly positive for GFP. We made similar observations in 2 month-old <span class="yellow">mice</span> (data not shown) confirming earlier published results [21]). We did not observe Mash1+/GFP+ and NeuN+/GFP+ cells (Figure 2G). These data from Ngn2+/GFP <span class="yellow">mice</span> are entirely consistent with our earlier observations using immunocytochemistry to label Ngn2-expressing cells and with GFP undergoing slow degradation after the expression of Ngn2 has ceased. Importantly, none of the GFP-expressing cells, including those only weakly fluorescent, residing in the SGL expressed the astrocytic marker GFAP or the oligodendrocytic markers CNPase (data not shown). Taken together, the data show that Ngn2 progenies become neurons and never generate astrocytes or oligodendrocytes.<br><br>Marked reduction of hippocampal granule neurons in absence of Ngn2
To determine the role of Ngn2 during the initiation of hippocampal granule neurogenesis, we analyzed the hippocampus of <span class="yellow">mice</span> lacking Ngn2 (Ngn2GFP/GFP). In contrast to the <span class="yellow">mice</span> use by Galichet and coworkers, our <span class="yellow">mice</span> have a lifespan of only 2 weeks after birth. Therefore, we analyzed 2 week-old and younger <span class="yellow">mice</span>. Consistent with previous observations [20], the hippocampus in Ngn2GFP/GFP mutants is clearly malformed (Figure 3A). In two week-old Ngn2GFP/GFP <span class="yellow">mice</span>, the ventral blade of the DG is completely absent. Already on postnatal day 1–2, the ventral blade of the DG is malformed along its whole rostro-caudal axis (Figure 3B).
As neither migration defects nor cell death cause the reduced number of hippocampal neurons in Ngn2 null <span class="yellow">mice</span> [20], we asked if Ngn2 is necessary for production of hippocampal granule neuroblasts. We first injected 2 day-old <span class="yellow">mouse</span> pups with BrdU 2 hours prior to sacrifice, allowing us to evaluate cell proliferation and ongoing neurogenesis. We also injected BrdU into female <span class="yellow">mice</span> on their final day of pregnancy and examined the brains of their pups 48 hours later (corresponding to P1–P2 old pups). This allowed us to assess the number of neurons derived from the last day of intrauterine development. Regardless of whether the <span class="yellow">mice</span> were WT or hetero/homozygous mutant pups, we found cells that had incorporated BrdU in the hippocampal subventricular zone (hSVZ), fimbria and the DG (Figure 4A and B; [28]), suggesting that progenitors originating in the hSVZ divide while migrating towards the DG. Most of them were organized in chains typical of migrating cells (Figure 4A and B and figure S2). In Ngn2GFP/GFP mutant <span class="yellow">mice</span> injected with BrdU 2 hours prior to sacrifice, we observed a decrease in the number of BrdU+ cells compared to heterozygous littermates. Thus, the numbers of newborn cells were reduced in the hSVZ/fimbria (133.3±7.5 for Ngn2+/GFP vs 69.7±5.0 for Ngn2GFP/GFP) and DG (132.0±9.1 for Ngn2+/GFP vs 42.6±2.2 for Ngn2GFP/GFP)(Figure 4C and D). We also examined the number of newborn cells differentiating into neurons, and identified them by the co-expression of BrdU and NeuroD1. As expected, they were relatively few in numbers because the short delay (2 hours) between BrdU administration and sacrifice in this first experimental paradigm. In Ngn2GFP/GFP null mutants, we found the number of cells differentiating into neurons to be reduced by 60% and 71% in the hSVZ/fimbria (8.6±1.4 for Ngn2+/GFP vs 3.4±0.5 for Ngn2GFP/GFP) and DG (9.7±1.1 for Ngn2+/GFP vs 2.8±0.6 for Ngn2GFP/GFP), respectively, (Figure 4E and F). As a result, the number of NeuroD1+ cells in the DG was reduced by 80% (580.3±27.7 for Ngn2+/GFP vs 116.2±7.3 for Ngn2GFP/GFP; Figure 4G).
We obtained similar results in the second paradigm, i.e. in <span class="yellow">mice</span> that we sacrificed 48 hours after BrdU administration and in which a larger number of the newborn cells had time to mature into neurons. In this case, the number of BrdU+/NeuroD1+ cells in the DG was reduced by 73% of Ngn2GFP/GFP mutant animals (91.5±24.1 for Ngn2+/GFP vs 26.4±3.3 for Ngn2GFP/GFP) (Figure 4J). We found no differences in the proportion of BrdU+ cells that expressed NeuroD1 in Ngn2+/GFP and Ngn2GFP/GFP <span class="yellow">mice</span> (14.2±1.0% and 17.4±1.8% respectively; Figure 4K). This shows that the few cells that manage to proliferate in the Ngn2 null <span class="yellow">mice</span> have the same ability to differentiate into neurons as those in <span class="yellow">mice</span> with one Ngn2 allele.
Interestingly, the absence of Ngn2 did not alter the identity of neurons in the DG granule layer in 2 week-old Ngn2 null <span class="yellow">mice</span>. The maturing granule progenitors sequentially expressed Pax6, Tbr2 (Figure S3A and S3B), NeuroD1 and Calretinin (Figure 4L), PSA-NCAM (Figure 4N), Tbr1 (data not shown) and Prox1 (Figure 4M). We confirmed that the same transcriptional cascade is active in the 20% (compared to <span class="yellow">mice</span> with one Ngn2 allele) residual granule neurons that are formed two day-old in Ngn2GFP/GFP <span class="yellow">mice</span> (Figure S3D–G and data not shown).
We next investigated if the cells that failed to develop into neurons in Ngn2GFP/GFP mutant <span class="yellow">mice</span>, became glial cells. We found that cells expressing GFP never co-labeled with the astrocyte marker GFAP (Figure 4N) or the oligodendrocyte marker CNPase (data not shown).
Altogether, our results show that Ngn2 plays an important role during the production/amplification of hippocampal granule neuroblasts, but not the acquisition of the granule neuron identity (Figure S7).<br><br>Ngn2 controls the amplification of granule neuron progenitors
We next monitored the mitogenic activity of Ngn2+ cells in the DG of 2 week-old WT <span class="yellow">mice</span>. We observed that over 50% of Ngn2+ cells in the DG of WT <span class="yellow">mice</span> co-expressed the mitosis marker Ki67 (Figure 5A). Inspired by this finding, we injected BrdU into 2 week-old WT and Ngn2GFP/GFP <span class="yellow">mice</span> and compared cell proliferation in the DG. We observed 92% reduction in number of proliferating cells in the SGZ of Ngn2 null mutant <span class="yellow">mice</span> (6.7±0.5) compared to WT (83.6±1.2) and heterozygotic (data not shown) littermates (Figure 5B–C). This data confirm the importance of Ngn2 during the amplification of granule progenitor.s.
To further explore whether Ngn2+ cells become post-mitotic or still proliferate after Ngn2 is downregulated, we performed immunohistochemistry on sections through the DG of Ngn2+/GFP <span class="yellow">mice</span>. We stained them with the mitosis marker Phospho-histone 3 (PH3) and NeuroD1, which is downstream of Ngn2 in the transcriptional cascade controlling neurogenesis. Thus, in the same sections we could identify whether cells that had initiated Ngn2 expression (GFP labeled), continued to divide (PH3+) or committed to neuronal differentiation (NeuroD1+). We observed some GFP+ cells that co-expressed PH3. They all exhibited morphological characteristics of one of the five mitotic phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase and cytokinesis (Figure 5D and data not shown). Unexpectedly, cells that colabeled for GFP, PH3 and NeuroD1 (Figure 5E and figure S4A and S4B) were rare. This indicates that Ngn2+ cells undergo division/amplification and that they mature into post-mitotic neurons upon NeuroD1 expression. In <span class="yellow">mice</span> lacking Ngn2, we found the cells expressing GFP localized to the malformed ventral blade of the DG (Figure 5F and G). All of these cells were Ki67+ and they only very rarely expressed PH3 (Figure 5F and G, and figure S4C) in the absence of Ngn2 most of the cells are arrested in the cell cycle prior to entering the M phase and their mitosis is impaired. These data suggest that the mechanism of action of Ngn2 is conserved from development of the DG to postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis.
Our findings suggest that Ngn2 regulates amplification and cell cycle exit of DG granule progenitors. To examine this hypothesis, we compared the effects of Ngn2 and NeuroD1 on mitotic activity in embryonic cortico-hippocampal neurosphere-derived progenitors, 5 days upon transduction, in vitro. In cultures transduced with Ngn2 retrovirus, we found that 27.2% (±4.1%) of the PH3+ cells had been transduced (Figure I1–J). These cells were immunopositive for MAP2 (Figure 5I1 and I2) and therefore represented dividing neuroblasts. By contrast, in NeuroD1 transduced cultures, only 7.3% of PH3+ cells were GFP+ (Figure 5H1, H2 and J). All of the NeuroD1-transduced cells became MAP2+ (Figure 5H). To confirm this data we pulse-labeled transduced cultures with chlorodeoxyuridine (CldU) for 48 hours, five days after differentiation. In contrast to NeuroD1-transduced cultures, we observed dividing cells transduced with Ngn2 retrovirus that were positive for PH3 and that had incorporated CldU (Figure 5K–L2). As the number of cells PH3+/CldU+/GFP+ we observed was low, we did not quantify this finding.
Collectively, we have shown that Ngn2 is required for granule neuroblast production and amplification and that in the absence of Ngn2 the progenitors arrest in the cell cycle. NeuroD1, on the other hand, induces cell cycle exit and promotes rapid neuronal maturation.<br><br>NeuroD1 directs neuronal differentiation and maturation
Based on our previous observations we proposed that Ngn2 primarily controls amplification of granule neuroblasts and NeuroD1 directs neuronal differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we overexpressed Ngn2 or NeuroD1 in E14.5 cortico-hippocampal neurospheres and compared their effects after 5 days of differentiation of the progenitors. All cortico-hippocampal progenitors expressed Pax6 prior to differentiation (Figure S5). After 5 days, both factors suppressed Pax6 and Sox2 (Figure S5, figure 6C) and induced expression of Tbr1, Map2, NeuroD1 and PSA-NCAM (Figure 6D and E).
Interestingly, all Ngn2-overexpressing cells co-expressed NeuroD1. Based on these findings, we next explored whether Ngn2 overexpression induces NeuroD1 expression, and if NeuroD1 in turn directs neuronal differentiation. We compared the effects of both transcription factors in progenitors that either do or do not normally express them. Thus, we expressed Ngn2 in E14.5 neural progenitors isolated from three different brain regions: cortex/hippocampus, lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) and ventral mesencephalon (VM). Ngn2 expression in the developing forebrain is normally limited to the neocortex, and it does not appear in LGE tissue [29]. In the developing VM, both Ngn2 and NeuroD1 are expressed, but not when neural progenitors from this region are cultured in vitro [30], [31]. In our experiments, cortico-hippocampal progenitors could differentiate into neurons, although they did not normally express NeuroD1 (Figure 6E). When we overexpressed Ngn2 in VM and LGE progenitors, the cells started to express both NeuroD1 and PSA-NCAM (Figure 6F and G). We then overexpressed NeuroD1 in the same types of cultured progenitors and found that the cells became immunoreactive for PSA-NCAM (Figure 6G and data not shown). Thus, NeuroD1 is sufficient to direct neuronal differentiation in cortico-hippocampal-, LGE- and VM-derived progenitors.
Our results from in vitro cultures and the analysis of the DG of Ngn2 mutant animals collectively show the neuron-inducing effect of NeuroD1 in hippocampal granule cell progenitors [32].<br><br>NeuroD1 directs exclusive neuronal differentiation of hippocampal granule neuron progenitors
As the next step, we tested the effects of NeuroD1 in vivo and compared them with those of Ngn2. We injected retroviruses carrying the gene for either Ngn2 [33] or NeuroD1, and the reporter gene eGFP into the ventricles E15.5 <span class="yellow">rat</span> embryos, in utero (Figure 7A). Three weeks later, when the <span class="yellow">rats</span> were about two weeks old, we examined their hippocampi and analyzed the eGFP+ cells. The <span class="yellow">rats</span> injected with control vector exhibited eGFP+ cells within the hippocampus that were either star-shaped, progenitor/glial-like cells (14.8±3.4%) or neuron-like cells with long neurites (85.3±3.4%) (Figure 7B). In <span class="yellow">rats</span> that we had injected with the vector encoding Ngn2, the eGFP-labeled, the transduced hippocampal cells were composed of 31.9% (±5.7%) progenitor/glia-like cells and 69.4% (±6.1%) neuron-like cells (Figure 7B). The glia-like subpopulation was immunopositive for the astrocytic marker GFAP (Figure 7C–D). In contrast, virtually all of the transduced cells in <span class="yellow">rats</span> injected with the NeuroD1 vector became neuron-like cells (99.9%±0.1; Figure 7B). None of these cells stained for GFAP (Figure 7E and F). They were positioned in the external layers of both the ventral and dorsal blades of the DG (Figure 7B3, E and I and figure S6A).
When we examined neuronal maturation of Ngn2- and NeuroD1-transduced cells, we observed that only a few of those transduced with the NeuroD1 vector expressed the early mature neuronal marker Tbr1 (3.1±1.4%; Figure 7I and J). They were located within the basal layers, near the SGL, of the ventral and dorsal blades of the DG. In contrast, a greater proportion of the cells transduced with Ngn2 still expressed Tbr1 (19.6%±3.3%; Figure 7H and J), indicating that they were less mature than the vast majority of the NeuroD1-transduced cells. Immunohistochemistry for NeuN confirmed these data (Figure 7M and O, and figure S6A). Indeed, when we overexpressed Ngn2 the proportion of hippocampal progenitors that became NeuN+ was no greater than in <span class="yellow">rats</span> transduced with the control virus (Figure 7F).
As a whole, our in utero injection experiments confirm that NeuroD1 has a stronger neuron-inducing effect than Ngn2 when overexpressed in hippocampal progenitors.<br><br>Involvement of Mash1, Ngn2, Tbr and NeuroD proteins during <span class="yellow">human</span> hippocampal neurogenesis
Finally, we examined whether the transcription factors and cellular markers that are expressed in rodents are also expressed in <span class="yellow">human</span> hippocampus. We performed immunohistochemistry on aged <span class="yellow">human</span> hippocampal DG and found GFAP-, Sox2-, Pax6-, Nestin-, Prox1- and NeuN-immunopositive cells. This indicates that radial glia-like stem cells, neural progenitors and mature granule neurons are present in the aged <span class="yellow">human</span> hippocampus (Figure 8A–E). While Prox1 is found mainly in granule neurons, Sox2 and Pax6 are exclusively localized to cells in the SGZ (Figure 8D and E).
As for aged rodents, we did not observe the presence of Mash1, Ngn2, Tbr2, Tbr1 and NeuroD1 proteins in aged <span class="yellow">human</span> hippocampus, using immunohistochemistry. However, we could identify the presence of the transcripts, using RT-PCR (Figure 8F). In addition, we detected mRNA for Prox1, Calbindin1 and Calbindin2/Calretinin (Figure 8F). Interestingly, we also observed Sonic Hedgehog and Wnt-3A transcripts, indicating that they are present in the <span class="yellow">human</span> DG and supporting previous claims that they are important for the regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (Figure 8F; [34], [35]). Finally, we also found mRNA for GLAST, Pax6 and GFAP which suggests that radial glia-like stem cells are present in the adult <span class="yellow">human</span> hippocampus, and may play a role in adult <span class="yellow">human</span> hippocampal neurogenesis (Figure 8F; [8]).
Overall, our data show that different proteins known to play key roles in <span class="blue">rodent</span> hippocampal granule neurogenesis are present in the adult <span class="yellow">human</span> hippocampus.<br><br>
Discussion
In this study we determine the functions of Ngn2 and NeuroD1 during hippocampal neurogenesis. First, we map the hierarchy of molecular markers of neurogenesis in the DG. Second, we describe that Ngn2 is necessary for granule progenitor production/amplification. Third, we demonstrate that NeuroD1 directs neuronal differentiation of granule progenitors. Finally, we show that different cellular markers expressed during hippocampal neurogenesis in rodents are present in <span class="yellow">human</span>.
Sequential expression of different transcription factors and cellular markers during hippocampal neurogenesis
We clarified the pattern of expression of various markers expressed during postnatal and adult hippocampal granule neurogenesis in detail. We found that the transcription factor Pax6 is initially expressed by both radial glia stem cells (type-1) and early amplifying progenitors (type-2a). The next transcription factor to appear in chronology is Mash1. Mash1 expression characterizes the early stage of hippocampal progenitor amplification (early type-2a). The role of Mash1 during hippocampal granule neurogenesis is still unclear. Mash1 null mutant <span class="yellow">mice</span> do not display any clear malformation of the DG [20]. However, overexpression of Mash1 alone in the DG leads to the generation of oligodendrocytes [36]. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that Mash1-expressing cells are not yet committed towards a granule cell fate. They may still have the potential to generate both neurons and oligodendrocytes, as is the case in the SVZ [37].
In agreement with different developing brain regions, we found that Ngn2 starts to be expressed in Mash1-positive transiently amplifying progenitors, i.e. “late type-2a cells” according to the classification we propose. We observed that Pax6 expression persisted longer than that of Mash1, in Ngn2-expressing cells (late type-2a cells), in juvenile but not adult DG (Fig. 1 and figure S1). Later on, Ngn2 is downregulated, whilst Tbr2 expression persists (type-2b cells). The transition from amplifying progenitor to neuroblast is defined by the expression of NeuroD1. Thus, Ngn2 is expressed at the beginning of the transiently amplifying progenitor phase while NeuroD1 marks the end of that period. This applies both to the juvenile and adult <span class="yellow">rat</span> brain [21], [25]. After NeuroD1 is turned on the progenitors leave the cell cycle, gradually mature, express PSA-NCAM, NeuroD2, Calretinin, Prox1, Tbr1 and, finally, NeuN. NeuroD1 expression persists at low levels in mature neurons (Figure 9; [10]). We found the sequential expression of these markers conserved in juvenile (P2 and 2 weeks) and adult <span class="blue">rodent</span> brains. Importantly, we observed that the same transcription factors and neuronal markers are also present in the adult <span class="yellow">human</span> hippocampus and arranged spatially in a manner reminiscent with what we saw in rodents. It is possible, however, that some of these markers are expressed for longer or shorter periods at postnatal and adult stages of hippocampal progenitor maturation. Moreover, one can ask to which extent the number of divisions occurring during neuroblasts maturation is conserved at postnatal and adult stages of neurogenesis.<br><br>A new function for Ngn2 in maintenance of a progenitor state for granule neuron production/amplification during embryonic and postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis
In agreement with earlier work, we confirm that Ngn2 is indispensable for hippocampal development and plays a vital role in postnatal hippocampal granule neurogenesis. Ngn2 null mutant animals display a reduced size of the cornu ammonis and a malformed DG (Figure 3 and 4; [20]). We show that the number of newborn neurons (incorporated BrdU) is decreased in absence of Ngn2, but hippocampal granule neuron subtype specification is not affected, post-nataly. Likewise, neurons from other brain regions, e.g. ventral midbrain dopamine neurons, can be generated in the absence of Ngn2 [30], [31]. The reduced numbers of mature neurons in the hippocampus and ventral midbrain of Ngn2 null mutant animals does not appear to be due to cell death or migration defects [20], [31]. Instead it may be due to a defect in the generation and/or amplification of neuronal progenitors. Indeed, in the hippocampus of postnatal animals, we observed that cells lacking Ngn2 arrest in the cell cycle, maintain Pax6 expression and cease to proliferate.
When overexpressed in neural progenitors in vitro, Ngn2 lead to up-regulation of NeuroD1 and caused neuronal differentiation (Figure 6), which was not always the case when we overexpressed the same factor in vivo (Figure 7L, N and O). We also saw that Ngn2 does not always efficiently induce cell cycle exit. Typically some mitotically active eGFP+ cells were present in the DG of <span class="yellow">rats</span> injected with the Ngn2 retrovirus (Figure 7P), and we observed that cultured Ngn2-transduced cells are still capable of dividing. Thus, Ngn2 does not always promote cell cycle exit and neuronal commitment, but depending on the state of the cells, Ngn2 may instead promote alternate cellular fates [38]–[40]. Indeed, an earlier study has shown that Ngn2-overexpressing progenitors generate oligodendrocytes when grafted to the adult spinal cord [40]. We have also seen that Ngn2-overexpressing neural progenitors from the embryonic midbrain form astrocytes when grafted to the striatum (unpublished observations). Probably, Ngn2 cannot influence already committed cells, but rather would control neuroblasts production. One could speculate that Ngn2 oscillates during granule neuron formation, as recently demonstrated during neocorticogenesis [41], [42].<br><br>NeuroD1, but not Ngn2, is obligatory for granule neuron progenitor differentiation
Hippocampal granule progenitors can mature and express Tbr1 and Prox1, both during the development and postnatally, even in the absence of Ngn2. Because neuronal differentiation still occurs in Ngn2 null <span class="yellow">mice</span>, it is clear that compensatory, Ngn2-independent mechanisms induce NeuroD1 expression. One candidate is Ngn1, which is expressed during neocorticogenesis, the specification of olfactory sensory neurons and during embryonic <span class="yellow">rat</span> hippocampal development [43]–[47]. Both Ngn1 and Ngn2 regulate NeuroD1 [19], [48]. The introduction of two mutant forms of Ngn1, a deletion of the basic region of Ngn1 and a substitution of two amino acids in the C-terminal basic region, prevents NeuroD1 expression and neuronal differentiation [48]. The double null Ngn1/Ngn2 mutant displays a more severe phenotype than single gene (Ngn1 or Ngn2) mutant <span class="yellow">mice</span>. For example, the total brain size of the double mutants is much smaller [10], [32]. If the role of Ngn1 during hippocampal neurogenesis is to activate NeuroD1 and that of Ngn2 is to control granule neuroblasts production/amplification, the DG of double Ngn1/Ngn2 knockout <span class="yellow">mice</span> should resemble that of NeuroD1 null mutant <span class="yellow">mice</span>.
We demonstrated that NeuroD1 directs neuronal differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. In progenitors isolated from different embryonic brain regions and cultured in vitro, we found that overexpression of NeuroD1 induced neuronal differentiation. The neurons generated expressed PSA-NCAM, Dcx and MAP2. After in utero retroviral vector-mediated gene delivery, virtually all cells transduced with NeuroD1 became neurons. In contrast, progenitors transduced with Ngn2 or control retroviruses adopted a neuron-like morphology in only 70–85% of cases. Under in vitro cell culture conditions, when we overexpressed Ngn2 in progenitors derived from the LGE we observed robust expression of NeuroD1 and neuronal differentiation. These in vitro results differ from those we obtained when we transduced the embryonic brain with a viral vector expressing Ngn2. In this latter case, Ngn2 did not induce neurons and the transduced cells did not express NeuroD1. Therefore, Ngn2 appears to direct non-neuronal cell type specification in vivo [38]–[40]. Taken together, we have confirmed that NeuroD1 plays a key role in neuronal differentiation in the hippocampus, both during development and in the adult brain.<br><br>Concluding remark
We present a detailed classification of different stages in hippocampal neurogenesis. Our detailed molecular mapping of hippocampal neurogenesis allows for a more accurate analysis of how new factors stimulate neurogenesis at different steps in the development of granule neurons. Thereby we hope to facilitate the development of new agents, which stimulate endogenous progenitors in the treatment of diseases.<br><br>
Materials and Methods
Animal tissue preparation
The creation of the Ngn2 transgenic <span class="yellow">mice</span> was reported elsewhere (ref guillemot). Heterozygote male and female <span class="yellow">mice</span> were crossed to obtain WT, heterozygote (Ngn2+/GFP) and null mutant (Ngn2GFP/GFP) animals. Tails of the Ngn2 offspring were used to obtain DNA for determination of the genotype using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay as previously reported [31]. As null mutant Ngn2GFP/GFP do not survive longer than 2.5–3 weeks after birth, Ngn2GFP/GFP and their littermates were sacrificed at the postnatal ages of two days (P2) or two weeks for this study. Neurogenesis was assessed in two weeks or two months old WT <span class="yellow">mice</span>. Sprague Dawley pregnant <span class="yellow">rats</span> were ordered from B&K Universal Ltd, Sollentuna, Sweden (hppt://www.bku.com). All animals were housed in groups with ad libitum access to food and water at a 12-h light/dark cycle. All experimental procedures conducted in this study had been approved by the Ethical Committee at Lund University.
For immunohistochemical analysis, <span class="yellow">mice</span> (from two weeks old and adult stage) and juvenile <span class="yellow">rats</span> were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion with saline for 5–10 minutes, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 minutes. Brains were kept in PFA overnight at 4°C and subsequently cryopreserved in a 20–30% sucrose/0.1 M phosphate buffer solution until sectioning on a microtome apparatus (30 µm thickness sections, Microm Zeiss). Seven series of coronal sections were cut throughout the brain. Free-floating sections were preserved in antifreeze solution until immunohistochemistry was performed. Heads of postanatal two days old <span class="yellow">mice</span> were decapitated and soaked in PFA 4% for 24 hours, at 4°C and transferred into sucrose solution until sectioning on cryostat apparatus (16 µm thickness; Leica CM3000). Sections were mounted on Superfrost glass slides and stored at −80°C until immunohistochemistry was performed.<br><br>Cloning, subcloning, virus production and titer measurement
The Moloney leukemia-derived retroviral vectors used in this study, pCMMP-IRES2eGFP-WPRE and pCMMP-Ngn2-IRES2eGFP-WPRE were previously described [40], [49]. To generate the construct pCMMP-NeuroD1-IRES2eGFP-WPRE, <span class="yellow">mouse</span> NeuroD1 cDNA was amplified from a pCS2+mtNeuroD1 plasmid (kindly provided by Professor Jackie Lee, Denver university, Boulder, USA) by PCR to introduce the restriction sites PmeI in 5′ and XhoI in 3′. Amplification of cDNA was performed as previously described [49]. The construction was verified by enzymatic restriction and by DNA sequencing using BigDye 3.1 (ABI). All infectious particles were produced using the producer cell line 293VSV-G and as previously described [49]. The titer of each retrovirus was measured by flow-cytometry based on eGFP expression, four days following infection of HT1080 cells and ranged from 0.5×109−2.1×109 TU/ml (All details on how to produce infectious particles can be provided upon request).<br><br>Neurosphere generation, transduction and differentiation
Pregnant female <span class="yellow">Sprague-Dawley rats</span> (B & K Universal, Sollentuna, Sweden) were terminally anesthetized by an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (i.p., 60 ng/ml). Embryos at stage embryonic day E14.5 (Plug day as day 0) were collected and cortical-hippocampal neurospheres were generated following dissection of the dorso-posterior part of the cortical tissue, and generated as previously described [49]. In this study, second passage (P2) neurospheres were used to study the effect of the overexpression of Ngn2 and NeuroD1 on neuronal differentiation. Each well, containing an equal starting population of 200,000 cells/ml, corresponding to 15–25 neurospheres, was transduced independently with each retrovirus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, in proliferation medium supplemented by protamine-sulfate (4 mg/ml, Sigma). To induce differentiation, the medium was replaced with normal basic differentiation medium two days post-transduction and subsequently changed every other day until fixation.<br><br>Immunocytochemistry, immunohistochemistry and microscopy
The antibodies used in this study are: <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-GFAP (1∶1000; DAKO), <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-Nestin (1∶100; BD PharMingen), <span class="yellow">guinea pig</span> anti-Glast (1∶500; Chemicon), <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-Prox1 (1∶1000; Covance), <span class="yellow">goat</span> anti-Ngn2 (1∶20; Santa Cruz), <span class="yellow">goat</span> anti-NeuroD1 (1∶200; Santa Cruz), <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-Pax6 (1∶150; Covance), <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-Trb2 (1∶500; Chemicon), <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-Trb1: (1∶1000; Chemicon), <span class="yellow">goat</span> anti-Dcx: (1∶500; Santa Cruz), <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-PSA-NCAM: (1∶500; Chemicon), <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-NeuN (1∶300; Chemicon), <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-Calretinin (1∶500; Swant); <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-Sox2 (1∶100; R&D systems), <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-Mash1 (1∶100; BD PharMingen), <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-NeuroD2 (1∶300; ABCAM), <span class="yellow">mouse</span> anti-MAP2 (1∶500; Sigma), <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-Ki67 (1∶150; NovaCastra) and <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> anti-phospho-Histone H3. The secondary antibodies (1∶200) Cy2, FITC, Cy3 and Cy5 were from Jackson IR laboratories, Alexa-fluor 488, 568, 595 and 647 from Invitrogen-Molecular Probes. DAPI (1∶1000) was purchased from Sigma.
For immunocytochemistry, cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at day five, rinsed with PBS three times prior to pre-incubation with a blocking solution (10% <span class="yellow">donkey</span> serum, 0.25% TritonX100 in PBS) for 1 hour. The remainder of the procedure was performed as previously described [49]. Specimen analyses were performed using a Leica confocal microscope (Leica software, equipped with a GreNe and a HeNe laser, using the following lines of excitation: 488 nm, 594 nm and 647 nm). Samples were analyzed using 20×, 40× and 63× objectives, sometimes zoomed. Figures were composed in CANVAS-X software.<br><br>Bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and Cloro-deoxyuridine (CldU) pulse labeling and immunohisto- and immunocyto-chemistry
To assess cell proliferation and ongoing neurogenesis in vivo, animals were injected with BrdU (100 mg/kg, Sigma), two hours prior to sacrifice (for both P2 and two weeks old Ngn2 <span class="yellow">mice</span>). To assess neurogenesis, BrdU (100 mg/kg) was injected 48 hours prior to sacrifice (for P2 animals, BrdU was injected in pregnant dams half day prior to give birth). Immunohistochemistry was carried on as described above using a <span class="yellow">rat</span> anti-CldU/BrdU primary antibody (1∶200, monoclonal, Immunologicalsdirect, Oxfordshire, UK), with an additional denaturation in 1 M HCl for 30 minutes prior to pre-incubation with serum.
To assess the neuronal-inducing activity of Ngn2 and NeuroD1, transduced cultures were incubated with CldU (20 µM, Sigma) for 2 days, after a period of differentiation of five days. For immunocytochemistry, cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at day 7, rinsed with PBS three times, treated with 1 M HCl at 65°C for 5–10 min, pre-incubated and then incubated with a <span class="yellow">rat</span> anti-CldU/BrdU antibody and other primary antibodies. The remainder of the procedure was performed according to the protocol for immunohistochemistry already mentioned.<br><br>In utero surgery
Timed pregnant female <span class="yellow">Sprague Dawley rats</span> with embryos at gestational age E15.5 were anesthetized with halothane. The mother was placed in the lower level of a two-level wooden stage. The abdomen was shaved with an electric razor and then cleaned with 70% alcohol. A 2–3 cm midline laparotomy was performed. Each uterine horn was carefully taken out individually and the number of embryos recorded. One horn was then placed back inside the mother, whilst the other horn was prepared for injection. The embryos were kept moist with constant application of warm saline to prevent dehydration. Approximately 2 µl of viral suspension (1×10∧9TU/ml) was injected into the lateral ventricle of each embryo, except for the embryo closest to the vagina. After the injections, the uterine horns were placed back into the abdomen. The abdominal wall and the overlying skin were then sutured. Care was taken not to damage abdominal muscles so that normal delivery of the pups was possible at term. The entire surgery generally took about 45 minutes to one hour. Each mother was allowed to recover in her cage before being returned to the animal stable. Shredded paper was added to each cage to encourage nesting and special care was taken not to stress the mothers. Following normal delivery, the pups were allowed to develop to adulthood up to two weeks.<br><br>Quantification
For the in vivo experiment, manual cell counting was performed on 18 and 30 µm thick brain sections for two days and two weeks old animals, respectively. The brain of P2 animals was cut into 10 series of coronal sections; the brain of two-weeks old animals was cut into 7–8 series of coronal sections. For each staining, one-two series from three to five different individuals were analyzed per genotype using a confocal microscope with 1, 2 or 3 lines of excitation, in sequential scanning in order to avoid false positives. When two series were analyzed, only one series was counted. The mean number of cells per hippocampus expressing the markers of interest, was calculated for each brain, based on the analysis of 6–8 consecutive dorsal hippocampal sections. The final mean number of cells per section was calculated by adding the mean number from each individual. We expressed the data as the mean number of positive cells±standard error of the mean (SEM). In this study, more than 25 Ngn2 null, >45 Ngn2 heterozygotes, and >60 WT individuals (including <span class="yellow">rats</span> injected with retroviruses) were analyzed, in total. Statistical comparison was performed using one-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) with transcription factor, cellular marker, genotype or time as variables, followed by post-hoc analysis when significant differences were observed, using Statview 5.0 software (SAS institute Inc.). For cell culture experiments, three independent experiments were performed, each in duplicate. The counting was based on seven randomly chosen different fields of view. For each diagram, the level of significance (p-value) is represented as follows: P<0.05 = *; P<0.001 = **; P<0.0001 = ***. All data are expressed as±standard error of the mean (SEM).<br><br><span class="yellow">Human</span> sample and RT-PCR
The brain from a 64 year-old male was provided by the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center. The individual whose brain tissue was being analyzed gave written consent for storage and use of his tissue for research. Five millimeters thick fresh <span class="yellow">human</span> hippocampal tissue sample was snap frozen. The frozen tissue block was cut into 20 series of coronal sections, using a cryostat. Every 10 sections, one section was placed in an Eppendorf tube, on dry ice. Pooled sections were used for RT-PCR. Total RNA was prepared using Trizol and RNAeasy, supplemented with RNAGuard as previously described [49]. The RNA was digested with <span class="yellow">shrimp</span> DNAse before cDNA synthesis, which was performed using a mix of oligo-dT and random hexamer primers and SuperscriptII reverse transcriptase. Advantage2 polymerase mix (Clontech/BRL) was used for PCR, with the following cycling conditions: 10 cycles of 94° C for 30 seconds, 68°C for 2 minutes, 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 60°C for 1 minute, 68°C for 1 minute and 30 seconds, one cycle of 68° C for 2 minutes, soak at 16°C.

<h3>pmcA2412862</h3>Minocycline attenuates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation, sickness behavior, and anhedonia
Abstract
Background
Activation of the peripheral innate immune system stimulates the secretion of CNS cytokines that modulate the behavioral symptoms of sickness. Excessive production of cytokines by microglia, however, may cause long-lasting behavioral and cognitive complications. The purpose of this study was to determine if minocycline, an anti-inflammatory agent and purported microglial inhibitor, attenuates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation, sickness behavior, and anhedonia.<br><br>Methods
In the first set of experiments the effect of minocycline pretreatment on LPS-induced microglia activation was assessed in BV-2 microglia cell cultures. In the second study, adult (3–6 m) BALB/c <span class="yellow">mice</span> received an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of vehicle or minocycline (50 mg/kg) for three consecutive days. On the third day, <span class="yellow">mice</span> were also injected (i.p.) with saline or <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span> LPS (0.33 mg/kg) and behavior (i.e., sickness and anhedonia) and markers of neuroinflammation (i.e., microglia activation and inflammatory cytokines) were determined. In the final study, adult and aged BALB/c <span class="yellow">mice</span> were treated with the same minocycline and LPS injection regimen and markers of neuroinflammation were determined. All data were analyzed using Statistical Analysis Systems General Linear Model procedures and were subjected to one-, two-, or three-way ANOVA to determine significant main effects and interactions.<br><br>Results
Minocycline blocked LPS-stimulated inflammatory cytokine secretion in the BV-2 microglia-derived cell line and reduced LPS-induced Toll-like-receptor-2 (TLR2) surface expression on brain microglia. Moreover, minocycline facilitated the recovery from sickness behavior (i.e., anorexia, weight loss, and social withdrawal) and prevented anhedonia in adult <span class="yellow">mice</span> challenged with LPS. Furthermore, the minocycline associated recovery from LPS-induced sickness behavior was paralleled by reduced mRNA levels of Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase (IDO) in the cortex and hippocampus. Finally, in aged <span class="yellow">mice</span>, where exaggerated neuroinflammation was elicited by LPS, minocycline pretreatment was still effective in markedly reducing mRNA levels of IL-1β, TLR2 and IDO in the hippocampus.<br><br>Conclusion
These data indicate that minocycline mitigates neuroinflammation in the adult and aged brain and modulates the cytokine-associated changes in motivation and behavior.<br><br><br><br>Background
The bi-directional communication between the immune system and the central nervous system (CNS) is necessary for mounting the appropriate immunological, physiological, and behavioral responses to immune stimulation [1]. CNS innate immune cells including microglia and macrophages play integral roles in receiving and propagating inflammatory signals that are initiated at the periphery. Activation of peripheral innate immune cells elicits the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα.), that use neural [2,3], humoral [4] and blood brain barrier pathways [5] to relay this signal to the CNS. This inflammatory signal, in turn, induces CNS macrophages and microglia to produce the same cytokines [6], which target neuronal substrates and elicit a sickness behavior syndrome that is normally adaptive and beneficial to the host [1]. An amplified or excessive inflammatory cytokine response in the brain, however, is associated with a myriad of complications including cognitive dysfunction [7-10], prolonged sickness behavior [11-14], and depressive-like behavior [15].
Microglia are primarily involved in immune surveillance [16,17], but when activated have macrophage-like capabilities including phagocytosis, inflammatory cytokine production, and antigen presentation [18]. Normally these neuroinflammatory changes are transient with microglia returning to a resting state as the immune stimulus is resolved. Aging or neurological disease, however, may provide a brain environment where microglia are more "reactive or primed" to a peripheral immune challenge [19]. Recent findings indicate that several markers of glial activation such as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, complement receptors, and scavenger receptors are increased in brain during normal aging [13,20-26]. Furthermore, we and others have reported that a biological consequence of this reactive glial profile is an exaggerated neuroinflammatory response to innate immune challenge [9,10,12-14,27,28].
Active microglia and CNS macrophages also contribute to the production of oxidative and neuroactive mediators that may influence behavior. For instance, inflammatory cytokines in the CNS upregulate the enzyme IDO [29,30], which metabolizes tryptophan (TRP) into L-kynurenine (KYN) [31]. TRP degradation to KYN can reduce TRP levels that are required for serotonin synthesis [32] and can lead to the production of neuroactive mediators including 3-hydroxykynurenine (3HK) and quinolinic acid (QUIN) [31]. High levels of 3HK and QUIN induce neuronal damage through oxidative stress [33] and over stimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors [34,35]. A recent study indicates that while several cell types in the CNS express IDO, only microglia maintain all the enzymes required to produce 3HK and QUIN [36]. Because IDO mediated TRP degradation impacts both serotonergic and glutamatergic pathways, this may be an important mechanism underlying mood and behavior complications concomitant with inflammation [37-39].
Because activated microglia are suspected to cause or exacerbate several neurodegenerative diseases, pharmacological strategies to suppress microglial activity are being explored as therapies. Minocycline is a tetracycline derived antibiotic that has anti-inflammatory properties in the CNS that are separate from its antimicrobial action [40]. Minocycline readily crosses the blood brain barrier and attenuates inflammation associated with microglial activation. For example, minocycline blocks the deleterious effects of neuroinflammation on neurogenesis, long-term potentiation, and neuronal survival [41-43]. The mechanism of action is unclear, but recent studies indicate that minocycline abrogates MAPkinase and NFκB dependent signaling pathways in primary microglia and microglia cell cultures [44]. Moreover, in the brain of <span class="yellow">rats</span>, minocycline abrogates microglial expression of CD11b and MHC II through a protein kinase-c dependent mechanism [45]. This is relevant because minocycline attenuates neuroinflammation in several <span class="red">rodent</span> models of disease including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis [46], Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) [45] and MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease [47]. However, the extent to which minocycline facilitates the recovery from cytokine-mediated sickness behavior is unknown.
The present study investigated the degree to which minocycline–an anti-inflammatory agent and purported microglial inhibitor–reduced LPS-induced neuroinflammation and sickness behavior. We show that minocycline blocked LPS-stimulated inflammatory cytokine secretion in the BV-2 microglia-derived cell line and reduced LPS-induced Toll-like-receptor-2 (TLR2) surface expression on brain microglia. Moreover, our data show that minocycline pretreatment attenuated LPS-induced weight loss, social withdrawal, and anhedonia in adult <span class="yellow">mice</span>. The attenuation of sickness behavior was paralleled with minocycline dependent decrease in markers of neuroinflammation (IL-1β, TLR2, and IDO) in adult and aged <span class="yellow">mice</span>. These findings support our hypothesis that the ability to mitigate cytokine expression in the brain during systemic inflammatory events may be useful in preventing cognitive and behavioral deficits.<br><br>Methods
Animals
Male BALB/c <span class="yellow">mice</span>, adults (3 month old) and juvenile (3–4 week old) were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). For age comparisons, male BALB/c <span class="yellow">mice</span> (3–4 and 20–22 month old) were purchased from the National Institute on Aging specific pathogen free colony. Upon arrival, <span class="yellow">mice</span> were individually housed in polypropylene cages and maintained at 21°C under a 12 h light: 12 h dark cycle with ad libitum access to water and <span class="red">rodent</span> chow. At the end of each study, <span class="yellow">mice</span> were examined postmortem for gross signs of disease (e.g., splenomeglia or tumors). Data from <span class="yellow">mice</span> determined to be unhealthy were excluded from analysis (< 5%). All procedures were in accordance with the National Institute of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by The Ohio State University Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee.<br><br>Cell culture
BV-2 microglia cell lines were cultured in growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, sodium bicarbonate 3.7 g/l, 200 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml fungizone) as previously described [12]. Cultures were maintained at 37°C with 95% humidity and 5% CO2 and growth medium was replenished every third day until confluence. Cultures were washed twice and supplemented with warm growth medium containing experimental treatments. Cell viability was measured by the MTS cell proliferation assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI).<br><br>CNS macrophage/microglia isolation
CNS macrophages and microglia were collected from whole brain homogenates as described previously [48], but with several modifications. <span class="yellow">Mice</span> were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation and whole brains were collected. Brains were homogenized in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) pH 7.4. Brain homogenates were passed through a 70 μm nylon cell strainer and centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were removed and cell pellets were re-suspended in 70% isotonic Percoll (GE-healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) at room temperature. A discontinuous Percoll density gradient was set up as follows: 70%, 35%, and 0% isotonic Percoll. This suspension was centrifuged for 30 minutes at 400 × g. A mixed population of CNS macrophages and microglia was collected from the interphase between the 70% and 35% Percoll layers. Cells were washed and then re-suspended in sterile HBSS. The number of viable cells was determined using a hemacytometer and 0.2% trypan blue staining.<br><br>Flow cytometry
Flow cytometric analysis of microglial cell surface markers was performed as described previously, but with a few modifications [48]. In brief, Fc receptors on macrophages and microglia were blocked with anti-CD16/CD32 antibody (eBiosciences, CA). Next, cells were incubated with either Panel-1 (anti-CD11b APC, anti-CD45 FITC, and anti-MHC II PE from eBiosciences, CA) or Panel-2 antibodies (anti-CD11b APC, anti-CD45 FITC, and anti-TLR2 PE from eBiosciences, CA). Expression of these surface receptors was determined by flow cytometry using a Becton-Dickinson FACSCaliber four color Cytometer. Thirty thousand events were collected and microglia were differentiated from macrophages based on the levels of CD11b and CD45 surface expression. Microglia stain CD11b+/CD45low and macrophages stain CD11b+/CD45high [48,49]. Flow data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, San Carlos, CA).<br><br>Behavior tests
Social exploratory behavior
To assess the motivation to engage in social exploratory behavior, a novel juvenile conspecific was introduced into the test subject's home cage for a 10-min period. Behavior was video taped and the cumulative amount of time the subject engaged in social investigation was determined from the video records by a trained observer who was blind to the experimental treatments. Baseline social behavior was measured at time 0 for all experimental treatments. Social behavior was determined as the amount of time that the experimental subject spent investigating (e.g., anogenital sniffing, trailing) the juvenile. Results are expressed as percent decrease in time engaged in social behavior compared to respective baseline measures.<br><br>Sucrose preference
To assess sucrose preference, <span class="yellow">mice</span> were provided two solutions, water or water supplemented with 2% sucrose, in 50 ml conical tubes with stoppers fitted with ball-type sipper tubes. Prior to testing conditions, all <span class="yellow">mice</span> were acclimated to the two bottle test choice. All <span class="yellow">mice</span> drank both the water and the 2% sucrose solution, but preferred drinking the sucrose over the water (data not shown). On the day of testing, <span class="yellow">mice</span> were fluid and food deprived for 2 h prior to testing [50]. At the start of the dark phase of the photoperiod, drinking water and the 2% sucrose solution were placed in the home cage overnight (15 h). At the end of each testing period the fluid content of the conical tubes was measured and sucrose preference was determined using the equation: Sucrose intake/Total fluid intake (water + sucrose intake) × 100 [51].<br><br>
Plasma cytokine measurement
IL-6 and IL-1β were measured in the plasma as previously described [52]. In brief, <span class="yellow">mice</span> were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation and blood was collected by cardiac puncture into EDTA coated syringes. Samples were centrifuged (6000 × g for 15 min at 4°C) and plasma was collected and stored frozen (-80°C) until assaying. Plasma samples were assayed for IL-6 using a customized ELISA that we have described in detail [52] and for IL-1β using a commercial ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Assays were sensitive to 8 pg/ml of IL-6 and 1.5 pg/ml of IL-1β, and inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation were less than 10%.<br><br>Real time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from brain using the Tri Reagent protocol (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). RNA samples were subjected to a DNase I digestion procedure and then reverse transcribed to cDNA using a RT RETROscript kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Quantitative real time PCR was performed using the Applied Biosystems (Foster, CA) Assay-on Demand Gene Expression protocol as previously described [13]. In brief, cDNA was amplified by real time PCR where a target cDNA (IL-1β, IL-6, MHC II, TLR2, or IDO) and a reference cDNA (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) were amplified simultaneously using an oligonucleotide probe with a 5' fluorescent reporter dye (6-FAM) and a 3' quencher dye (NFQ). Fluorescence was determined on an ABI PRISM 7300-sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, CA). Data were analyzed using the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method and results are expressed as fold difference.<br><br>Experimental protocols
For the cell culture studies, minocycline was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and BV-2 cells were washed and replenished with growth mediumsupplemented with 0, 25, 50, 100, 200, or 400 μg/ml minocycline. After 30 min, LPS at 10 ng/ml was added to the culture medium. Supernatants were collected 4 h later and IL-6 and IL-1β concentrations were determined by ELISA. Total proteins were determined from cell culture homogenates by the Bio-Rad Dc protein assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad Lboratories, Hercules, CA). Each treatment was replicated a minimum of four times. Cell viability was confirmed by the MTS cell proliferation assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI).
For all <span class="yellow">mouse</span> studies, minocycline (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in sterile water and sonicated to ensure complete solubilization. In the first <span class="yellow">mouse</span> study, adult male BALB/c <span class="yellow">mice</span> received an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of vehicle or minocycline (50 mg/kg) for three consecutive days. On the 3rd day, <span class="yellow">mice</span> were also injected i.p. with saline or <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span> LPS (0.33 mg/kg; serotype 0127:B8, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation 24 h later (n = 6). The LPS dosage was selected because it elicits a proinflammatory cytokine response in the brain resulting in mild transient sickness behavior in adult <span class="yellow">mice</span> [13,53]. Macrophage/microglial cells were isolated from whole brain homogenates and TLR2 and MHC II surface expression were determined by flow cytometry. The minocycline injection regimen and dosage was selected because a repeated pretreatment course with minocycline is necessary to attenuate neuroinflammation [41-43,45].
In the second study, adult male BALB/c <span class="yellow">mice</span> received an i.p. injection with vehicle or minocycline for three consecutive days. On the third day, motivation to engage in social behavior was determined immediately before i.p. injection of saline or LPS (0.33 mg/kg) and again 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h later (n = 8). Body weight and food intake were measured at each time point over the 24 h period. In a related, but separate study, adult <span class="yellow">mice</span> were treated with minocycline and LPS as described and anhedonia was assessed 24–39 h following i.p. injection of saline or LPS (0.33 mg/kg) (n = 15). Body weight, food intake, water intake, and sucrose intake were determined over the testing period.
In the third study, adult BALB/c <span class="yellow">mice</span> were treated with minocycline and then LPS as described. <span class="yellow">Mice</span> were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation 4 later. Brains were removed and dissected to collect different brain regions. Brain regions were stored at -20°C in RNAlater (Qiagen, CA). Total RNA was isolated from brain samples and assayed using quantitative PCR (n = 8). Plasma was also collected and stored (-80°C) until assaying.
In a final study, adult (3–4 month old) or aged (20–22 month old) male BALB/c <span class="yellow">mice</span> were treated with minocycline and LPS as described and euthanized 4 h later. Brains were dissected to collect different brain regions and were stored at -20°C in RNAlater (Qiagen, CA). Total RNA was isolated from the hippocampus and assayed using quantitative PCR (n = 8).<br><br>Statistical analysis
All data were analyzed using Statistical Analysis Systems (SAS) General Linear Model procedures. Data were subjected to one, two- (Mino × LPS, Age × LPS, Mino × Age) or three-way (Mino × LPS × Time, Mino × LPS × Age) ANOVA to determine significant main effects and interactions between main factors. When appropriate, differences between treatment means were evaluated by an F-protected t-test using the Least-Significant Difference procedure of SAS. All data are expressed as treatment means ± standard error of the mean (SEM).<br><br>
Results
Minocycline attenuates LPS-induced cytokine production in BV-2 microglia
Minocycline is a tetracycline-type antibiotic that has anti-inflammatory properties in the CNS [41-43,45]. To determine the degree to which minocycline suppresses microglia activation, BV-2 microglia-derived cell lines were used. In the first experiment, BV-2 cells were treated with LPS and IL-6 production was determined 4 h later. Fig. 1A shows that LPS increased IL-6 production in a dose dependent manner F(5, 23) = 101, P < 0.001). In the second experiment, BV-2 cells were incubated with DMSO or minocycline and then stimulated with LPS. Minocycline reduced LPS-induced IL-6 secretion in a dose dependent manner (Mino × LPS interaction, F(4, 23) = 16.87, P < 0.001, Fig. 1B). Minocycline pretreatment had a similar anti-inflammatory effect on LPS-stimulated IL-1β secretion (Fig. 1C). In a third experiment, minocycline suppressed LPS-induced MHC II, TLR2, IL-1β, and IL-6 mRNA levels (P < 0.05, for each, Fig. 1D). The MTS assay verified that neither cell survival nor proliferation was affected by the experimental treatments (data not shown).<br><br>LPS-induced TLR2 surface expression on microglia is reduced by minocycline
Because minocycline attenuated LPS-induced cytokine secretion and TLR2 mRNA expression in BV-2 cells we next sought to determine if minocycline suppresses markers of microglial activation in the brain of <span class="yellow">mice</span>. <span class="yellow">Mice</span> were injected i.p. with vehicle or minocycline for 3 consecutive days then challenged with saline or LPS i.p. Markers of activation, TLR2 and MHC II, were determined on microglia collected 24 h later. The representative bivariate density plot in Fig. 2A shows that there were two populations of CD11b/CD45 positive cells and that more cells stained CD11b+/CD45low (microglia) than CD11b+/CD45high (CNS macrophages). ANOVA revealed that LPS injection increased TLR2 surface expression on microglia (F(1, 20) = 17.6, P < 0.004, Fig. 2B&D), but this induction was abrogated by minocycline pretreatment (Tendency for Mino × LPS interaction, F(1, 20) = 2.66, P = 0.10, Fig. 2C&D). It is important to note that because minocycline and saline controls did not differ in their TLR2 expression, these data were grouped together as the Control group (Fig. 2B&C). In addition, neither minocycline nor LPS treatment had a significant main effect on MHC class II surface expression on microglia (data not shown). These data indicate that minocycline attenuated LPS-induced TLR2 expression on microglia.<br><br>Minocycline facilitates the recovery from LPS-induced sickness behavior
CNS macrophages and microglia produce inflammatory cytokines and secondary messengers that modulate behavioral responses. Therefore, we next investigated if minocycline reduced the sickness response associated with peripheral LPS injection. In this experiment, adult <span class="yellow">mice</span> were treated with minocycline and LPS as described. Social exploratory behavior was measured before i.p. LPS injection and again 2, 4, 8, and 24 h later. Fig. 3A shows that LPS injection caused a reduction in social exploratory behavior (F(1,57) = 218, P < 0.001) that was time dependent (F(4,57) = 66.5, P < 0.001). Moreover, the LPS-associated reduction in social exploration was attenuated by minocycline (Mino × LPS interaction, F(1,57) = 7.5, P < 0.007). For example, at 8 h post LPS, social exploration was reduced by 35% in minocycline pretreated <span class="yellow">mice</span> given LPS compared to a 67% reduction in vehicle pretreated <span class="yellow">mice</span> given LPS (P < 0.001). While minocycline administration alone reduced food intake and body weight in control <span class="yellow">mice</span> (P < 0.05, for each), it also protected against LPS-associated anorexia (Mino × LPS interaction, F(1, 60) = 70.0, P < 0.001, Fig. 3B) and weight loss (Mino × LPS interaction, F(1, 60) = 29.7, P < 0.001, Fig. 3C).
Because sickness can also be associated with longer lasting changes in motivation [38], we next sought to determine if minocycline abrogated LPS-induced anhedonia [54,55]. In this experiment, <span class="yellow">mice</span> were subjected to the same minocycline injection regimen and LPS challenge as above and sucrose preference was assessed 24–39 h post LPS injection. By 24 h post LPS injection, food and water intake returned to baseline and LPS treated <span class="yellow">mice</span> still exhibited a marked reduction in sucrose preference from 24–39 h (F(1,59) = 14.3, P < 0.003). Moreover, this LPS-dependent reduction in sucrose preference was prevented by minocycline pretreatment (Mino × LPS interaction, F(1, 59) = 9.9, P < 0.004, Fig. 4). For example, minocycline pretreated <span class="yellow">mice</span> injected with LPS maintained the same strong preference for sucrose as saline and minocycline controls (i.e., approximately 85% preference). These data can be interpreted to indicate that minocycline blocks anhedonia associated with peripheral LPS challenge.<br><br>Minocycline reduces LPS-induced neuroinflammation
Pro-inflammatory cytokines in the CNS are partially responsible for the behavioral symptoms of sickness (e.g., anorexia, social withdrawal, and anhedonia) [1]. Therefore, we investigated the degree to which minocycline reduces neuroinflammation (IL-1β, IL-6, and IDO) after peripheral injection of LPS. In this experiment, <span class="yellow">mice</span> were subjected to the minocycline injection regimen and LPS challenge as above and cytokine mRNA levels were determined in the cortex and hippocampus 4 h after LPS injection. In <span class="yellow">mice</span> pretreated with vehicle, LPS markedly increased IL-1β mRNA levels in the hippocampus (F(1,31) = 62, P < 0.0001) and cortex (F(1,31) = 17.25, P < 0.0003). The LPS-induced IL-1β mRNA expression was reduced in both brain regions in <span class="yellow">mice</span> receiving minocycline prior to LPS injection: (hippocampus, F(1,31) = 9.63, P < 0.01) and cortex, F(1,31) = 7.23, P = 0.08, Fig. 5A). LPS caused a similar induction of IL-6 mRNA levels in the hippocampus (F(1,31) = 37.2, P < 0.001) and cortex (F(1,31) = 22.5, P < 0.001), but minocycline pretreatment only significantly attenuated LPS-induced IL-6 mRNA levels in the hippocampus (F(1,31) = 10.27, P < 0.004, Fig. 5B).
IDO mRNA levels were determined from the same RNA pool. Fig. 6D shows that LPS injection increased IDO mRNA expression in the hippocampus (F(1,31) = 11.69, P < 0.002) and cortex (F(1,31) = 5.26, P < 0.03). This LPS-induced IDO mRNA expression was attenuated by minocycline in the hippocampus (F(1,31) = 11.69, P < 0.002) and cortex (F(1,31) = 5.26, P < 0.03). It is important to note that IDO mRNA was undetected in saline treated <span class="yellow">mice</span>. Therefore, the fold IDO change was relative to the IDO mRNA levels in <span class="yellow">mice</span> receiving minocycline prior to LPS.<br><br>Minocycline reduces LPS-induced IL-6, but not IL-1β, in the plasma
Because cytokine signals can be relayed from the periphery to the brain by humoral pathways [56], plasma cytokine levels of IL-6 and IL-1β were determined 4 h post LPS injection. As expected, LPS injection caused a marked increase in plasma IL-1β (F(1,36) = 52.5, P < 0.001) and IL-6 levels (F(1,36) 34.01, P < 0.01). Minocycline pretreatment reduced LPS-induced IL-6 levels in the plasma (F(1,36) 6.68, P < 0.01) but had no significant main effect on LPS-induced IL-1β levels (Fig. 6).<br><br>Minocycline attenuates LPS-induced exaggerated neuroinflammation in aged <span class="yellow">mice</span>
Aged BALB/c <span class="yellow">mice</span> (22–24 m) have an exaggerated neuroinflammatory response to LPS injection [10,13,14]. Therefore, we next sought to determine if the heightened inflammatory response in the brain of aged <span class="yellow">mice</span> was reduced by minocycline. In this experiment, adult and aged <span class="yellow">mice</span> were subjected to the minocycline injection regimen and LPS challenge as above. As we have reported previously, MHC II mRNA expression was increased by age (P < 0.03, Fig. 7A)[13,14], but MHC II levels were unaffected by either LPS or minocycline treatment (not shown). Consistent with the data presented in Fig. 2, ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of LPS injection on TLR2 mRNA expression in the hippocampus (F(1,63) = 85.5, P < 0.001). Moreover, LPS caused a greater increase in TLR2 mRNA in the hippocampus of aged <span class="yellow">mice</span> compared to adults (LPS × Age interaction, F(1,63) = 12.70, P < 0.01). Furthermore, minocycline pretreatment attenuated LPS-induced TLR2 mRNA levels in both adult and aged <span class="yellow">mice</span> (Mino × LPS interaction, F(1,63) = 9.02, P < 0.004).
Parallel to the results for TLR2, LPS caused a greater increase in IL-1β and IDO mRNA levels in hippocampus of aged <span class="yellow">mice</span> compared to adults (Age × LPS, F(1,60) = 8.64, P < 0.01 for IL-1β and F(1,60) = 4.0, P < 0.05 for IDO). Minocycline pretreatment attenuated LPS-induced mRNA levels of IL-1β (Mino × LPS, F(1,60) = 8.76, P < 0.01, Fig. 7C) and IDO (Mino × LPS, F(1,60) = 9.7, P < 0.003, Fig. 7D). While LPS induced higher IL-6 mRNA levels in the hippocampus of both adult and aged <span class="yellow">mice</span> (F(1,59) = 44.5, P < 0.001), there was not an Age × LPS interaction. Minocycline pretreatment attenuated the LPS-induced increase in hippocampal IL-6 mRNA (Mino × LPS, F(1,59) = 5.4, P < 0.02, Fig. 7E). Taken together these data indicate that minocycline pretreatment was effective in attenuating the exaggerated neuroinflammation in aged <span class="yellow">mice</span>.<br><br>
Discussion
In the elderly, systemic infection is associated with an increased frequency of behavioral and cognitive complications [57,58]. We have reported that stimulation of the peripheral immune system in older (20–24 m) BALB/c <span class="yellow">mice</span> causes exaggerated neuroinflammation that is paralleled by prolonged sickness [13], impaired working memory [10], and depressive-like behaviors [15]. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms that can modulate cytokine-mediated pathways in the brain. Here we show that minocycline treatment reduced LPS-induced TLR2 expression in BV-2 cells and on microglia isolated from adult <span class="yellow">mice</span>. Moreover, we demonstrate that minocycline was effective in facilitating the recovery from LPS-induced sickness and preventing anhedonia in adult <span class="yellow">mice</span>. Furthermore, we show that minocycline attenuated LPS-induced neuroinflammation in adults and normalized the exaggerated neuroinflammation in aged <span class="yellow">mice</span>.
Our findings, using cell culture and animal experiments, support the notion that minocycline attenuates microglial activation and limits production of inflammatory mediators. For instance, minocycline pretreatment of BV-2 cultures decreased LPS-stimulated cytokine production in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 1A). In BV-2 cells, minocycline also attenuated mRNA expression of inflammatory genes including IL-6, IL-1β, MHC II, and TLR2 (Fig. 1D). These data are consistent with other studies using minocycline and LPS in BV-2 cells [44,59]. Based on these data we next investigated if microglial activation could be attenuated in the brain. Because LPS increases brain cytokine production we expected that MHC II expression would also be increased. Contrary to our predictions, neither MHC II mRNA levels (Fig. 7) in the brain nor MHC II surface expression on microglia (CD11b+/CD45low) (data not shown) were increased by LPS injection. In an EAE model, minocycline reduced microglial expression of MHC II [45], but one key difference from our study is that the induction of EAE pathology requires functional antigen presentation on MHC II [60]. It is postulated that microglia have several activation states that depend on the specific inflammatory stimulus [61]. Thus, in situations of transient peripheral innate immune stimulation, markers in the CNS such as Toll-Like receptors [6] may be indicative of microglia activation. In support of this premise, our data show that LPS injection increases TLR2 surface expression on microglia (CD11b+/CD45low), which is inhibited by minocycline pretreatment (Fig. 2). These data are consistent with other studies showing that central or peripheral LPS challenge increases TLR2 mRNA in the brain [6,14]. Taken together our findings can be interpreted to suggest that minocycline attenuates pathways associated with microglia activation following peripheral LPS challenge.
One of the important findings of this study was that reduction of neuroinflammation by minocycline was associated with facilitated recovery from LPS-induced sickness behavior. These results are akin to our previous work with the anti-oxidant, α-tocopherol [52], and an NFKB decoy inhibitor [62]. Consistent with our previous studies [52,53,62,63], reductions in neuroinflammatory cytokines (Fig. 5) did not prevent the induction of the LPS-induced sickness response (2–4 h), but rather facilitated the recovery from sickness (8–24 h) (Fig. 3A). Recovery may be a critical issue because brain cytokines and the corresponding physiological and behavioral responses are beneficial to the host [1]. The potential risk for a maladaptive response occurs when the normally transient neuroinflammatory response is amplified or protracted [64]. Therefore pharmacological agents, similar to minocycline, that attenuate neuroinflammatory responses, but do not completely inhibit them, may be important in preventing the development of more severe and long-lasting cognitive and behavioral complications.
The results of the sucrose preference experiments support the idea that limiting exposure to neuroinflammation decreases the duration of behavioral responses. For example, while minocycline did not inhibit cytokine expression (Fig. 5) or the induction of sickness (Fig. 3A), minocycline pretreatment completely reversed the reduction in sucrose preference (i.e., anhedonia) associated with LPS injection (Fig. 4). It is also important to mention that while LPS-associated sickness and anhedonia are interrelated, these behaviors can be differentiated from one another. For instance, reduced social exploration was evident 2–24 h post injection (Fig. 3A), but only decreased sucrose preference was exhibited 24 to 39 h later (Fig. 4). This separation between behaviors is consistent with other studies investigating sickness and longer-lasting changes in motivation [15,65,66].
IDO mediated TRP metabolism represents a potential connection between activation of CNS innate immune cells and longer lasting behavioral responses. IDO mediated TRP metabolism in the brain may affect behavior by impacting both serotonin and glutamate pathways [39]. We have reported that IDO induction and activity is amplified in the brain of aged <span class="yellow">mice</span> and is associated with prolonged depressive-like behavior [15]. Here we show that IDO mRNA induction is blocked by minocycline in the brain of both adult and aged <span class="yellow">mice</span> (Figs. 5&7). These data are consistent with a recent report showing a causal relationship between IDO activity and acute depressive effects in adult CD-1 <span class="yellow">mice</span>. In this study, O'Connor et al. report that both 1-methyl tryptophan (a competitive inhibitor of IDO) and minocycline blocked IDO induction and prevented depressive-like immobility in the tail suspension and forced swimming tests [66]. Thus, in the present study, the minocycline blockade of IDO induction may explain the abrogation of LPS-induced anhedonia.
Another interesting finding was that while minocycline pretreatment in adult <span class="yellow">mice</span> attenuated LPS-induced brain IL-1β at 4 h (Fig. 5), it had no effect on plasma IL-1β levels (Fig. 6). Because IL-1β signals can be relayed from the periphery to the brain by humoral pathways [5], these findings suggest that minocycline has anti-inflammatory properties within the brain. These data are consistent with related findings that minocycline readily crosses the blood brain barrier to elicit an anti-inflammatory effect [41-43]. With regard to IL-6, minocycline pretreatment attenuated both brain and plasma levels at 4 h post LPS injection. Because circulating IL-6 levels can be increased by CNS mediated pathways including activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis [67] and the sympathetic nervous system [68], the specific reduction in plasma IL-6 by minocycline may reflect the reduction in brain inflammation at 4 h (Fig. 5). In support of this notion, we and others have reported that i.c.v. injection of LPS or IL-1β increase plasma IL-6 levels, but not IL-1β levels [14,68,69].
The final critical finding of this study was that minocycline was effective in attenuating neuroinflammation independent of age. Consistent with other aging and neuroinflammation studies, our data show that LPS caused exaggerated neuroinflammation in aged <span class="yellow">mice</span> compared to adults [10,13-15]. It is important to mention that while there was an age-related difference in MHC II expression in the hippocampus of saline treated <span class="yellow">mice</span> (Fig. 7A) there was not an age-related difference in IL-1β and IL-6 mRNA levels. These data differ from a previous report using BALB/c <span class="yellow">mice</span> showing an increase in IL-6 in older <span class="yellow">mice</span> [70]. This may be because the <span class="yellow">mice</span> used in the present study were approximately 4 months younger than the <span class="yellow">mice</span> used previously. Nonetheless, microglia can be primed or reactive with increased MHC II expression, but do not necessarily produce inflammatory cytokines in this state [19]. The key results are that peripheral LPS injection causes a greater induction of TLR2, IL-1β, and IDO mRNA in the aged brain than in the adult brain and that minocycline pretreatment normalizes this age-related exaggerated neuroinflammation (Fig. 7). These findings are also important because an amplified neuroinflammatory response in the aged brain is a precursor to complications including deficits in working memory, memory consolidation, and depressive-like behavior [9,10,15]. Based on the biochemical and behavioral data obtained from this study, we predict that minocycline will abrogate the prolonged LPS-induced sickness [13] and depressive-like behavior exhibited by aged BALB/c <span class="yellow">mice</span> [15]. We acknowledge, however, that future studies are necessary to test these predictions.<br><br>Conclusion
The present study demonstrates that minocycline reduces LPS-induced microglial activation, CNS cytokine production, and behavioral symptoms of sickness (e.g., social withdrawal and anhedonia). These findings are potentially important because they indicate that minocycline can be used to mitigate cytokine expression in the brain and have a beneficial affect on behavioral responses. Taken together, these data support the idea that pharmacological strategies aimed at decreasing neuroinflammation associated with microglial activation are important for improving recovery from sickness and reducing the frequency of neurobehavioral complications.<br><br>List of abbreviations

<h3>pmcA2556924</h3>Are there sensitive subgroups for the effects of airborne particles?
Abstract
Recent studies have shown that particulate air pollution is a risk factor for hospitalization for heart and lung disease; however, little is known about what subpopulations are most sensitive to this pollutant. We analyzed Medicare hospital admissions for heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders (COPD) and pneumonia in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois, between 1985 and 1994. We examined whether previous admissions or secondary diagnoses for selected conditions predisposed <span class="yellow">persons</span> to having a greater risk from air pollution. We also considered effect modification by age, sex, and race. We found that the air-pollution-associated increase in hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases was almost doubled in subjects with concurrent respiratory infections. The risk was also increased by a previous admission for conduction disorders. For COPD and pneumonia admissions, diagnosis of conduction disorders or dysrhythmias increased the risk of particulate matter < 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM(10))-associated admissions. <span class="yellow">Persons</span> with asthma had twice the risk of a PM(10)-associated pneumonia admission and <span class="yellow">persons</span> with heart failure had twice the risk of PM(10)-induced COPD admissions. The PM(10) effect did not vary by sex, age, and race. These results suggest that <span class="yellow">patients</span> with acute respiratory infections or defects in the electrical control of the heart are a risk group for particulate matter effects.

[Online 28 July 2000] http://ehpnet1.niehs.nih.gov/docs/2000/108p841-845zanobetti/abstract.html <br><br> Particulate air pollution has been associated with increases in daily deaths and hospital admissions in studies all over the world (1�15). These associations are now well documented but little is known, as yet, of the characteristics of <span class="yellow">persons</span> that put them at increased risk of adverse events related to particulate air pollution. This has been identified as a key data gap (16). Schwartz and Dockery (17) reported that <span class="yellow">persons</span> older than 65 years of age had a somewhat increased risk of death, and this has been confirmed in other studies (18). A more detailed examination of particulate matter-related risk by deciles of age (19) showed the risk beginning to increase at approximately 40 years of age and reaching its maximum for those 75 years of age and older. In addition to age, several studies suggest that <span class="yellow">persons</span> with respiratory illness are at increased risk for cardiovascular effects associated with air pollution. An examination of death certificates on high- and low-air pollution days reported a substantial difference in the proportion of deaths from cardiovascular causes that had respiratory disease as a contributing cause of death (19). A recent follow-up study of a cohort of <span class="yellow">persons</span> with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Barcelona, Spain, found an association between particulate air pollution and all-cause mortality in the cohort (20). The magnitude of the risk per microgram per cubic meter of exposure was substantially greater than that for the general population. Environmental Health Perspectives <br><br> Controlled exposure of animals with chronic bronchitis and control animals to concentrated air particles also demonstrated a potentiating effect of chronic lung disease in the response to airborne particles (21). This has led to the hypothesis that the cardiovascular effects of air pollution are predominantly in <span class="yellow">persons</span> with chronic lung disease. There has been even less done to examine potential modifiers of the effects of airborne particles on hospital admissions. The existing literature on comorbidity shows that comorbidity per se seems to increase the risk of adverse outcomes (22�30). Little is known about the role of these comorbidities as effect modifiers for the effects of air pollution. This study uses data from the Medicare system to examine potential short-term and long-term medical conditions that may increase a <span class="yellow">person</span>'s risk of hospital admissions associated with particulate air pollution. In addition, we examine potential effect modification by age, race, and sex. <br><br> Materials and Methods Health data. The Health Care Financing Administration (Baltimore, MD) maintains records of every hospital admission for Medicare <span class="yellow">participants</span> in the United States. <span class="yellow">Persons</span> in this database have a unique identifier. Using this identifier, we traced every hospital admission for heart and lung disease for each <span class="yellow">person</span> in Cook County, Illinois, between 1985 and 1994. We chose Cook County because it is the most populous <br><br> county in the United States with daily monitoring for particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 10 �m (PM10). The data were then analyzed to look at effect modification by concurrent and preexisting conditions as well as by age, race, and sex. To establish a baseline risk, we computed daily counts of hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease (CVD) [International Classification of Disease, 9th edition, World Health Organization, Geneva (ICD-9) code 390�429], pneumonia (ICD-9 code 480�487), and COPD (ICD-9 code 490�496, excluding 493). The association between these daily counts and PM10 was examined for the years 1988�1994, when daily PM10 monitoring data were available in Chicago. Once our baseline risks were established, we examined three classes of potential effect modifiers. First, we looked at whether previous admissions for selected conditions predisposed <span class="yellow">persons</span> to having a greater risk from air pollution. For each of the three admission categories (CVD, pneumonia, and COPD), we considered 10 causes (defined by a previous admission) as effect modifiers: COPD (ICD-9 code 490�496 except 493), asthma (ICD-9 code 493), acute bronchitis (ICD-9 code 466), acute respiratory illness (ICD-9 code 460�466), pneumonia (ICD-9 code 480�487), CVD (ICD-9 code 390�429), myocardial infarction (ICD-9 code 410), congestive heart failure (ICD-9 code 428), conduction disorders (ICD-9 code 426), and dysrhythmias (ICD9 code 427). To test the hypothesis that <span class="yellow">persons</span> with these conditions had higher risks of subsequent PM10-related admissions, we computed separate daily counts of admissions for our three target causes, stratified by whether or not the <span class="yellow">person</span> admitted had been previously admitted for the hypothesized predisposing condition. Separate analyses were then performed within each strata to see if the effects of PM10 differed by strata. Address correspondence to A.

These could represent the presence of a chronic condition (e.g., COPD) that has not resulted in a previous hospital admission. They could also represent acute conditions that may have increased the subjects' sensitivity to air pollution. For example, if respiratory infections modified the effect of particulate matter on the cardiovascular health of <span class="yellow">persons</span> with underlying heart disease, then the risk of a hospital admission for heart disease might be different in <span class="yellow">persons</span> with infections. If this were true, then the risk ratio of a 10-�g/m3 increase of PM10 on cardiovascular admissions of <span class="yellow">persons</span> with a concurrent respiratory infection would be different from the ratio in <span class="yellow">persons</span> without respiratory infection. To test these hypotheses, we computed separate daily counts of admissions for events with and without the concurrent conditions hypothesized to increase sensitivity to air pollution. These were taken as the same 10 conditions in the first analysis with certain exclusions for pairing that would be illogical. That is, the concurrent diagnosis of a specific cardiac condition was not treated as an effect modifier for admissions for any cardiovascular condition. Likewise, pneumonia and COPD were not possible concurrent conditions for each other. The third set of predisposing conditions considered was being older than 75 years of age, nonwhite, and female. These were examined for all three outcomes. We obtained weather data for O'Hare Airport from the EarthInfo CD-ROM (EarthInfo CD NCDC Surface Airways, EarthInfo Inc., Boulder, CO), and we obtained air pollution data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Aerometric Information Retrieval System network (31). <br><br> running-line smoother, loess (35), was chosen to estimate the smooth function. To control for weather variables and day of the week, we chose the smoothing parameter that minimized the Akaike's information criterion (36). To model seasonality we chose the smoothing parameter that minimized the sum of the autocorrelation of the residuals while removing seasonal patterns. Two autoregressive terms (37) were added in the model to eliminate the remaining serial correlation from the residuals. We used the mean of PM10 on the day of the admission and the day before the admission as our exposure variable. This gives results that are similar to those obtained fitting a full distributed lag model (38). PM10 was treated linearly. Our baseline models used the daily counts of CVD, pneumonia, and COPD admissions as outcomes. We then subdivided those counts by the presence or absence of the potential effect modifier and reestimated our regressions on those subgroups. We considered effect modification to be indicated when the estimates of PM10 in the group with the condition was outside of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the effect estimate in <span class="yellow">persons</span> without the condition. <br><br> Results Table 1 shows the mean daily admissions for COPD, cardiovascular, and pneumonia both overall and in the presence of the potential effect modifiers. For some effect modifiers such as conduction disorders or myocardial infarctions, the counts in conjunction with our respiratory outcomes are <br><br> low, which limits power. In general, the numbers are lower for examining effect modification by previous admissions than for effect modification by concurrent diagnosis. This is as expected because many clinically relevant comorbidities may never have resulted in a hospital admission. Table 2 shows the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile values for the environmental variables. The mean value for PM10 is 33 �g/m3. The daily values for PM10 were computed as the average of 10 monitors, two of which measured PM10 almost every day and the others less frequently (38). Table 3 shows the mean daily counts of CVD, COPD, and pneumonia by sex, age groups, and race. The distribution by sex is almost even, although the counts of admissions for males are generally lower (approximately 10%) than for females, particularly for cardiovascular diseases. The counts of CVD, COPD, and pneumonia admissions were similar for <span class="yellow">people</span> 65�75 or 75 years of age and older. Tables 4�6 show the results for the effect PM10 overall and stratifying by concurrent diagnosis and previous admissions. These are expressed as the percentage increase for 10 �g/m3 PM10. Table 4 shows the results for CVD. A 10-�g/m3 increase in PM10 was associated with a 1.31% (5% CI, 0.97%; 95% CI, 1.66%) increase in hospital admissions for heart disease in all elderly <span class="yellow">persons</span>. A concurrent (not previous) diagnosis of COPD modified the risk of PM10-associated admissions for heart disease. However, significant associations were still seen between PM10 <br><br> Table 1.

A significant association was also seen in <span class="yellow">persons</span> without any respiratory disease as a concurrent diagnosis, although the risk is much lower than in <span class="yellow">persons</span> with respiratory disease. However, the risk associated with PM10 was roughly doubled in subjects with concurrent respiratory infections and the risk estimates in those subjects were outside the 95% CI of the risk in <span class="yellow">patients</span> without concurrent respiratory infections. A previous admission for conduction disorders (e.g., heart block) increased the risk of a PM10-related subsequent admission for any heart condition, and a weaker indication of effect modification was seen for <span class="yellow">persons</span> with previous admission for dysrhythmias. In contrast heart failure and previous myocardial infarctions were highly insignificant as effect modifiers. Table 5 shows the results for COPD. Overall, there is a 1.89% (95% CI, 0.8�3.0) increase in COPD admissions for a 10�g/m3 increase in PM10. The results of the stratified analysis suggest that preexisting heart disease modifies Table 4.

Previous admissions for any cardiovascular disease increased the risk of a PM10associated COPD admission approximately 2.5-fold. A previous heart failure admission caused an even more striking increase in the PM10 effect. Previous admissions for dysrhythmias and conduction defects were rare (Table 1) with no power to examine effect modifications. Listings as concurrent diagnoses were more common and here they joined heart failure in increasing the risk of PM 10 -associated COPD admissions. For COPD there was also some indication that concurrent pneumonia or an acute respiratory infection admission in the last year increased risk. The low numbers made these estimates less precise, however. The percentage increase in pneumonia admission (Table 6) for 10 �g/m3 PM10 is higher than for COPD or CVD with an increase of 2.34% (95% CI, 1.66�3.0). As with COPD, <span class="yellow">persons</span> with heart disease appeared at higher risk of pneumonia hospital admissions associated with particulate air pollution. Here diagnoses suggestive of impaired autonomic control of the heart, such as conduction disorders or dysrhythmias, were associated with increased risk for PM 10 effects on pneumonia admissions. Unlike COPD, no difference was seen for congestive heart failure. <span class="yellow">Persons</span> with asthma Table 5.

Table 7 shows the results by sex, age, and race. None of the effect size estimates for any of the stratification variables were outside of the 95% CI for the opposite strata. There was a tendency for the effect of PM10 on CVD admissions to be higher for females, whereas the effect on pneumonia admissions was higher for males. In general, we found somewhat larger effects on whites compared to nonwhites, and for <span class="yellow">persons</span> older than 75 years of age compared to younger <span class="yellow">persons</span>. <br><br> Discussion In this analysis we examined whether the effect of PM10 on the risk of hospital admission for heart and lung disease was different depending on the presence of comorbidities. We found that PM10 was associated with hospital admissions for all three causes (CVD, COPD, and pneumonia) and we found not a general increase in PM10 related risk with comorbidities, but a specific pattern that is suggestive of potential mechanisms and consistent with other recent epidemiologic and toxicologic findings. One major finding of this study is that preexisting cardiovascular disease, particularly impaired autonomic control (conduction defects and dysrhythmias) and heart failure, substantially increased the risk of respiratory admissions associated with airborne particles. In fact, recent <span class="yellow">human</span> studies have shown that exposure to particulate air pollution is a risk factor for reduced heart rate variability (39�41). Reduced heart rate variability is an adverse response and a risk factor for arrhythmia. A new study of defibrillator discharges in <span class="yellow">patients</span> with implanted cardioverter defibrillators found that discharges were associated with air pollution (42).

This is the first study to suggest <span class="yellow">persons</span> with defects in the electrical control of the heart are also at higher risk of respiratory illness after exposure to airborne particles. These data also suggest that <span class="yellow">persons</span> admitted to hospitals for pneumonia during an air pollution episode may be at high risk for clinically significant conduction disorders during that hospital admission. <span class="yellow">Patients</span> with congestive heart failure were at greater risk of hospital admissions for COPD in association with airborne particles. Heart failure and COPD is not an uncommon combination. The finding that these <span class="yellow">patients</span> are at higher risk for admissions associated with particulate air pollution is new but is also consistent with several other recent reports. The spontaneous hypertensive <span class="yellow">rat</span> develops a model of heart failure, and recent studies have reported greater sensitivity to particulate air pollution in these <span class="yellow">rats</span>. These include both electrocardiogram abnormalities (44) and pulmonary toxicity (45,46). Similarly, in an epidemiologic study, Hoek et al. (47), found a higher relative risk of death with an increase in PM10 for congestive heart failure deaths than other deaths. The potential role of COPD in those heart failure deaths was not examined. Another consistent pattern in our data is of acute respiratory infections increasing susceptibility to airborne particles. Acute bronchitis, or more generally acute upper respiratory illnesses, as well as pneumonia, increased susceptibility to particle-associated admissions for CVD and COPD. The notion that air pollution exacerbates acute respiratory infections is well supported by studies which report associations between airborne particles and hospital admissions for respiratory infections (48,49). Zelikoff et al. (50) exposed <span class="yellow">rats</span> infected with streptococcus to concentrated air particles and reported a significant increase in bacterial burdens and in the extent of pneumonia compared to animals exposed to filtrated air. This suggests an impaired immune response. Similarly, exposure to combustion <br><br> particles enhances influenza infections in <span class="yellow">mice</span> (51). An impaired defense to respiratory infection is a major reason that <span class="yellow">persons</span> with COPD require hospital admission. If airborne particles result in further impairment the effect modification we observe makes good sense. The effect modification for heart disease admissions is more relevant. This modification is consistent with the earlier report of Schwartz (19), who found greater reports of respiratory complications on death certificates with an underlying cause of heart disease if the death occurred on a day with high levels of airborne particles. Although airborne particle exposure has been associated with increased exacerbation of asthma (2,12,48,52�59), this paper is the first to suggest that asthmatics are more susceptible to PM10-induced pneumonia exacerbation or to cardiovascular effects. The effects on pneumonia admissions are plausible, given the impaired ability to fight off infections in asthmatics with mucus plugs and the evidence the airborne particles impair the lungs' ability to fight off bacterial and viral infections, as noted earlier. The increased cardiovascular sensitivity, albeit weaker, is interesting. If airborne particles affect the cardiovascular system via the role of the lung in autonomic control, it is possible that asthmatics would be more sensitive to those effects. Animal models of asthma showed that combustion particles enhance the asthmatic response to aeroallergen challenges (59). This suggests an enhancement of pulmonary response in asthmatics. On the other hand, the diagnosis of asthma is problematic in the elderly, and crossover with COPD is possible. The possibility that this explains our results is reduced by our failure to find previous hospital admission for COPD was an effect modifier for the effect of particles on cardiovascular admissions. We must acknowledge several potential limitations of this study. First, we considered only previous admissions that occurred within Cook County. Hence <span class="yellow">persons</span> with previous admissions elsewhere would be misclassified to our reference group. The effect of this would be to reduce the difference in PM 10 effect between the two groups. VOLUME <br><br> Nevertheless, we identified some interesting interactions. We cannot exclude the possibility that there are areas we missed for this reason. We also examined interactions in a log relative risk model, which is inherently multiplicative. Although we believe this is justified because doubling the population exposed would be expected to double the pollution associated admissions, it results in a more conservative definition of interaction than would an additive risk model. Finally, our exposure is clearly measured with error. Most of this error is Berkson error (60) and hence will introduce no bias, and Zeger et al. (60) showed that the remaining error would have to have pathologic correlations with other variables to result in an upward bias. Another important result from this study, of course, is an estimate of the magnitude of the effect of airborne particles on public health. The PM10 concentrations in Chicago during this period were associated with approximately 1,600 additional admissions per year for heart disease, 740 additional admissions per year for pneumonia, and 170 additional admissions per year for COPD. These are not trivial increases in serious morbidity. The results of our study should be replicated in additional cities, although they do begin to fill in some missing information about the effects of airborne particles on health. More generally airborne particles have been associated with a broad range of systemic changes including heart rate variability (39�41), increased peripheral neutrophils (61�63), increased plasma viscosity (64), an increase in blood pressure (65), and the outcomes mentioned previously. The role of these systemic changes as potential sources of the specific effect modifications we have seen should be an area of fruitful research in the future. REFERENCES AND NOTES 1.

This method eliminates purification, cloning and analysis of each individual AluPCR product before library screening. A series of <span class="yellow">human</span> X chromosome irradiation hybrids were mapped by this method, using a cosmid reference library for comparisons between overlapping hybrids to identify interesting clones for further analysis. <br><br> INTRODUCTION <br><br> The generation of <span class="yellow">human</span> DNA probes specific for individual chromosomes and subregions of chromosomes has been advanced with Alu-sequence primed polymerase chain reaction amplification (Alu-PCR, 1-3). This method specifically amplifies sequences between Alu repeats from <span class="yellow">human</span> DNA in somatic cell hybrids and <span class="yellow">yeast</span> artificial chromosomes (YACs, 4). Individual Alu-PCR products can be purified from agarose gels or ligated into plasmid vectors to screen for single copy sequences. Unique Alu-PCR products are then localized to certain chromosome regions using DNA blots of somatic cell hybrid panels. Once localized, Alu-PCR fragments can be screened against genomic libraries to isolate longer DNA fragments from the region of interest. As an alternative to this multistep process we have developed a hybridization protocol for screening of cosmid and YAC libraries directly with pools of Alu-PCR products. <br><br> Two new <span class="yellow">human</span> specific Alu primers were used to generate DNA probes from a series of irradiation-reduced hybrids containing multiple <span class="yellow">human</span> X chromosome fragments of 1-2000 kb on a <span class="yellow">hamster</span> chromosome background (5; P.N.G., unpublished). The Alu-PCR products were hybridized as a pool of probes to X-specific cosmid and YAC libraries, after <br><br> competitive reassociation with an excess of <span class="yellow">human</span> DNA to both the library filters and radioactively labelled Alu-PCR products. Comparisons were made between clones identified by overlapping irradiation hybrids and single copy DNA probes hybridized to the cosmid and YAC libraries. <br><br> METHODS <br><br> Two <span class="yellow">human</span> Alu sequence primers were generated which were shown to be <span class="yellow">human</span> specific; 3144 from the 3' end of Alu: 5'-GAGCGAGACTCCGTCTCAAA-3' and 2729 from the 5' end of Alu: 5'-GTGGATCACCTGAGGTCAGGAGTTC-3'. All PCR reactions were carried out with 100 ng of hybrid DNA and 0.7 ,^g of a single Alu primer in 100 d41 of 0.01 M Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 0.0015 M MgCl2, 0.05 M KCI, 200 AtM each of dNTPs, 10% dimethlysulfoxide, and 2.5 units of Cetus Taq polymerase. Reactions were 30 cycles of 94?C for 2 min, 57?C for 2 min, and 74?C for 4 min followed by a final extension time at 74?C for 9 min. Reactions products were analyzed on 1 % agarose gels and shown to contain between five and twenty fragments, with sizes ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 kb. <span class="yellow">Chinese hamster</span> DNA and no DNA PCR reactions were done to control for non-<span class="yellow">human</span> products (data not shown). <br><br> Alu-PCR products were separated from Alu oligomers over Qiagen columns, and approximately 50-100 ng were labelled by random hexamer priming (6). The radioactively labelled pool of fragments was prehybridized with 37.5 ,^g of total <span class="yellow">human</span> DNA and 12.5 tsg of <span class="yellow">hamster</span> DNA immobilized on a cellulose support matrix, prepared as previously described (7). Reactions were at 65?C in 1 ml of 0.75M NaCl, 0.05M sodium phosphate pH 7.2, 0.005M  EDTA, 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), 0.5 mg/ml heparin, and 100 jig/ml denatured <span class="yellow">salmon</span> sperm DNA. The cellulose was pelleted and the supernatant boiled for 2 min every 12-16 hours (three times in two days). <br><br> Cosmid and YAC library filters (Hybond N+, Amersham) were prehybridized at 42?C for 16 hours with 100 jig/ml <br><br> * To whom correspondence should be addressed at <span class="yellow">Human</span> Genetics Laboratory, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Institute of Molecular Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headington, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK <br><br> 1991 Oxford University Press <br><br> 3316 Nucleic Acids Research, Vol. 19, No. 12 <br><br> Chromosome X <br><br> .,.., ., < <br><br> _ ., . < ., <br><br> *2.' 1- 7-_ <br><br> _-_ 1.

Filters were washed in 0.1 xSSC and 1.0% SDS, twice at room temperature and twice at 65?C for 30 min each and exposed to Kodak X-OMAT film for 2-3 days at -70?C with an intensifying screen. <br><br> For each hybridization, two sets of duplicate cosmid filters were used from the ICRF reference library system (8), each containing 9216 flow-sorted <span class="yellow">human</span> X chromosome cosmid clones or approximately 2 chromosome equivalents on a 22 x 22 cm filter (9). The coordinates of signals positive on duplicate cosmid filters were entered into the reference library database (G. Z, unpublished) using a digitizing tablet. For the X chromosome specific YAC library (A.P.M. and H.L., unpublished), about 420 YAC colonies were spotted manually onto filters from 96 well microtiter dishes using a 96 prong device. After growth on selective media for 3 days, YAC filters were processed for hybridization as previously described (10). <br><br> RESULTS <br><br> A panel of 195 X chromosome irradiation hybrids was constructed (50,000 rads) and characterized by DNA hybridization using 27 X chromosome markers and flourescence in situ hybridization using total <span class="yellow">human</span> DNA as probe (Benham et al., 1989; P.N.G., unpublished). This analysis indicated that the hybrids contained multiple small fragments (4-10 fragments of 1000-5000 kb each) with a preferential retaining of centromere sequences (90%). From this panel, nine irradiation hybrids were chosen that contained less than five different regions by DNA probe hybridizations, mostly from the short arm of the X chromosome (Fig 1). All nine hybrids were used in PCR reactions with 3'-Alu primer 3144 and two were used with 5'-Alu <br><br> Figure 3: Hybridization of Alu-PCR products generated with Alu primer 3144 from irradiation hybrid 54 to a filter containing 420 YAC clones from the <span class="yellow">human</span> X chromosome.

Example hybridizations to a <span class="yellow">human</span> X chromosome cosmid filter in Fig 2 shows the intensity and reliability of positive clones identified on duplicate filters with Alu-PCR products from the same irradiation hybrid (48) and the independence of clones identified with Alu-PCR products from a different hybrid (54). Fig 3 shows a single positive YAC clone after hybridization of Alu-PCR products from irradiation hybrid 54 to a filter containing about 420 YAC clones specific for the <span class="yellow">human</span> X chromosome. <br><br> The total number of cosmids identified with each pool of AluPCR products for each hybrid is shown in Table 1. From the average number of cosmids identified (24) in four chromosome equivalents screened and the estimated average DNA content in each hybrid (3000-15000 kb), the Alu-PCR products generated by a single primer were calculated on average to be 300-1500 kb apart, similar to published estimates for this method (1,2). Only 3-4 cosmids were identified in common using Alu-PCR products generated with either 3' or 5' Alu primers (3144 or 2729) from two hybrids (38 and 45). This shows that separate products were amplified with the two Alu primers since they prime synthesis from opposite ends of the Alu consensus sequence and Alu sequences are oriented in the genome either head to head, <br><br> A <br><br> B <br><br> C <br><br> El <br><br> I0 <br><br> Nucleic Acids Research, Vol. 19, No. 12 3317 <br><br> Table 1.

Therefore, by using the 3'- and 5'-Alu primers in separate PCR reactions with the same hybrid DNA, the total number of products and cosmid clones identified was almost doubled. <br><br> Table 1 also indicates how many cosmids were identified by Alu-PCR products from other hybrids, and 16 cosmids previously identified with unique DNA probes in the reference library database. As can be seen in Fig 1 and previous irradiation hybrid analysis, there is a preferential retention of centromere sequences (2,11). However, there were no cosmids identified in common from all the hybrids positive with centromere sequences. This is probably due to a paucity of Alu repeats in the correct orientation in alphoid centromere sequences and thus few or no Alu-PCR products would be amplified from the centromere. <br><br> Cosmids identified in common by several irradiation hybrids (Table 1) were most likely from regions of overlap outside the centromere area as shown by the previous DNA probe characterization (Fig 1). The overlap regions between hybrids were also seen by 16 cosmids (Table 1, Fig 1) that were hybridization targets of unique DNA markers in the reference library database that mapped in independent experiments to the overlap region. At least for several cosmids this showed that the Alu-PCR products identified target cosmids that were definitely from the expected region contained in the hybrids. For example, hybrids 21 and 54 were both shown to contain part of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) locus (Fig 1; P.N.G., unpublished) and had 11 cosmids in common, including one identified by the probe P20 from the deletion hotspot region of the DMD gene (12). In Fig 3 the hybridization of Alu-PCR products from hybrid 54 identified a YAC clone which was also positive for the DMD probe P20 (data not shown). This method also identified fragments in the hybrids that were not seen in the initial DNA characterization (Fig 1 and Table 1). Since the 27 DNA probes were not close enough to each other along the chromosome to detect all possible hybrid fragments (1000-5000 kb), many regions would have been untested. For example, AluPCR products from hybrids 45 and 48 identified several cosmids, also seen by the cDNA for chronic granulomatous disease gene (CYBB, 13) in Xp2 1.1, although this region was not tested in the original hybrid characterization. <br><br> DISCUSSION <br><br> The direct hybridization of Alu-PCR products from somatic cell hybrids to genomic libraries can bypass gel purification or ligation of fragments into plasmid vectors and individual analysis for single copy sequences. Hybridization of Alu-PCR products as <br><br> a pool to ordered array libraries such as the flow-sorted X chromosome cosmid library (9), allows the direct comparison of overlapping hybrids to pinpoint cosmids most likely to be from the region of interest. In conjunction with the reference library database (G.Z, unpublished) with 183 X chromosome probe hybridization entries, cosmids identified with both Alu-PCR products and uniquely mapped X probes immediately map them to the region of interest and proove that the method has worked. Similar hybridization experiments using Alu-PCR products from four overlapping irradiation hybrids identified four cosmids in common that mapped to the region of overlap by independent experiments (F.Muscatelli, A.P.M., P.N.G., H.L. and M.Fontes, in preparation). Since only 27 probes from the X chromosome were used to initially characterize the hybrids and the length of individual <span class="yellow">human</span> fragments in the irradiation hybrids is about 1000-5000 kb, many regions could have been undetected in the original analysis. The direct hybridization of Alu-PCR products to the cosmid reference library detected such fragments since they identified cosmids in common with uniquely mapped probes in regions not tested originally (Table 1 and Fig 1). This should prove to be a sensitive and efficient method to determine content and overlap of irradiation hybrids in conjunction with DNA blot hybridization. However, since the exact length of the <span class="yellow">human</span> DNA fragments for each hybrid and the spacing of Alu-PCR products along the chromosome is not known, it is difficult to directly correlate the number of target cosmids to the DNA content of the hybrids. <br><br> The direct hybridization of Alu-PCR products from irradiation or somatic cell hybrids to total genomic YAC libraries will be especially useful to construct long range YAC contigs from specific subregions of chromosomes. The dissection of a total genomic YAC library by this method may be more efficient than generating chromosome specific YAC libraries from somatic cell hybrids (usually a haploid <span class="yellow">human</span> chromosome on a diploid or greater <span class="red">rodent</span> background) or flow-sorted chromosomes, because of the low transformation efficiency of <span class="yellow">yeast</span>. <br><br> ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS <br><br> We would like to thank Gert-Jan Van Ommen for the probe P20 and Stuart Orkin for the CYBB cDNA probe.
