Abstract
Attempts to prevent the urea conversion of a 200-230,000 molecular weight DNA polymerase alpha to a 150-170,000 molecular weight form by the inclusion of protease inhibitors have not been successful. No other method has been found capable of dissociating a 50-70,000 fragment or subunit from the DNA polymerase subunit. Addition of this 50-70,000 subunit to the polymerase subunit does not aid the binding of the enzyme to DNA, but does have an effect on the utilisation of synthetic template-initiator complexes by the polymerase subunit.<br><br><br><br>

We have previously observed several species of <span class="yellow">calf</span> thymus <br><br> DNA polymerase a differing in size and charge  . In order of elution from DEAE cellulose they are enzyme A1 (200-230, 000 molecular weight), A2 (200-230, 000), B (100-110, 000) and C (150-170, 000). A poly (dA). oligo <br><br> (dT)10 preferring enzyme, enzyrrme D (140-150, 000 molecular weight) elutes just after enzyme B. The A enzymes seem identical in all properties except their charge. 5.0-5. 5S enzymes, analagous to B, have been observed to <br><br> C Information Retrieval Limited 1 Falconberg Court London Wl V 5FG England <br><br> 3341 <br><br> Nucleic Acids Research <br><br> arise as the result of proteolytic action  ' , similarly the B enzyme above 14 <br><br> ,but the relationship of the other observed species is not clear, nor is <br><br> the problem of which, if any, of these species is the replicative enzyme, <br><br> although circumstantial evidence has implicated a DNA polymerase a to be <br><br> 15 the replicative enzyme in <span class="yellow">adenovirus</span> infected KB cells <br><br> We have previously shown that several of these enzymes are inter<br><br> 16 <br><br> convertible . In particular, mild urea treatment can convert both A <br><br> enzymes to C enzyme, with the loss of a subunit or fragment of 50-70, 000 molecular weight. The C enzyme retains DNA polymerase activity, but <br><br> does show differences compared to A enzyme in heat sensitivity and sensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide. <br><br> Highly purified samples of A and C enzymes when subjected to sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis have shown a corre<br><br> lation of DNA polymerase activity with a polypeptide band 155, 000 molecular weight . Contaminating material of 50-70, 000 molecular weight appeared <br><br> to obscure the putative 50-70, 000 subunit in gels of A enzyme. The conclusions drawn were that DNA polymerase a is a 155, 000 molecular weight <br><br> polypeptide (C enzyrrme) which can and does associated with material of 50<br><br> 70, 000 molecular weight to give A enzyme, and that enzyme B is a proteol<br><br> 14 <br><br> ytic degradation product . The relationship of enzyme D to the others is <br><br> not clear. <br><br> It is possible that during the enzyme isolation procedure proteolytic action may have taken place on a 200-230, 000 molecular weight enzyme releasing 155, 000 and 50-70, 000 fragments which remain in association <br><br> until urea treatment separates them. It is also possible that urea treatment itself renders the enzyme susceptible to contaminating proteases. Further experiments to ascertain whether or not this is the case and, if so, to prevent it, have been carried out. <br><br> A enzyme can be reconstituted from C enzyme formed by the action <br><br> of urea on A enzyme by concentrating it with the 50-70, 000 molecular weight material. The A enzyrme obtained in this manner is highly purified, as is <br><br> the C enzyme formed by the urea treatment, and has been used in attempts to show differences in synthetic template-initiator complex utilisation <br><br> 3342 <br><br> Nucleic Acids Research <br><br> b y the se two enzyme s . <br><br> MATERIALS AND METHODS <br><br> <span class="yellow">Calf</span> thymus was obtained from 10-16 week old <span class="blue">calves</span> and frozen at <br><br> -20?C until required. Chromatographic media and chemicals were obtained <br><br> 6 <br><br> from sources previously referred to . Radioactive deoxynucleoside tri<br><br> phosphates were obtained from the Radiochemical Centre, Amersham, Bucks. Synthetic oligo and polynucleotides were obtained from P. L. Biochemicals <br><br> Inc., except for poly (dC) which was a gift from Dr. I.R. Johnston and pre<br><br> 17 <br><br> pared from oligo d(C)5 as described  . N-a-p Tosyl-L-lysine chloromethy<br><br> lketone HCl and phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride were obtained from Sigma and Trasylol from Bayer. <br><br> Except where indicated all buffers contained 20% w/v glycerol and <br><br> 1 mM dithiothreitol. Standard linear phosphate gradients were run between 0.03 M and 0.25 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.8. Gradient salt concentr<br><br> 2 <br><br> ations were measured using a conductivity meter as described . Urea was <br><br> prepared as a 4. 8 M solution in 20% w/v glycerol, stirred with Amberlite <br><br> MB3 and filtered. Dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 1 mM before use. <br><br> 6 DNA polymerase was assayed using activated DNA as described <br><br> except that the buffer was 50 mM tris HC1, pH 7.8. One unit of DNA polymerase activity incorporates ln mol [ H] dTMP into an acid insoluble form in one hour at 370C. Assays using synthetic template-initiator complexes were carried out at 30?C in 0. 12 ml. The template-initiator complexes <br><br> 6 <br><br> were prepared and assays processed as described . All assays contained <br><br> 1 mM dithiothreitol, 62. 5 p.g <span class="yellow">bovine</span> serum albumin, 1 ,ug template-initiator complex, enzyme protein and the relevant [ H] deoxynucleoside triphosphate at 0.1 mM and 12-15 cpm/pmol. These assays were carried out at either pH 6.4 in 20 mM sodium-potassium phosphate, or at pH 7.8 in 50 mM tris HCl and contained either 10 mM MgCl2 or 1 mM MnCl2 as indicated. <br><br> Preliminary purification of DNA polymerase a to Fraction IV was as <br><br> 6 <br><br> described , the purification steps being phosphocellulose chromatography, <br><br> ammonium sulphate precipitation and gel filtration on Sepharose 6B. <br><br> 3343 <br><br> Nucleic Acids Research <br><br> Enzyme obtained from the DEAE cellulose step is referred to as Fraction <br><br> V enzyme. Samples were prepared for sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and scanned as previously described2 <br><br> RESULTS AND DISCUSSION <br><br> (a)   Interconversion Studies <br><br> A enzyme was routinely converted to C enzyme by incubating 200500 units/ml of Fraction V A enzyme in 2.4 M urea in 0. 02 M potassium <br><br> phosphate, pH 7.8, for 60 minutes at 0?C. The mixture was then loaded on to a DEAE cellulose, washed with 0. 03 M potassium phosphate pH 7. 8, and enzyrme eluted either with the standard phosphate gradient or batchwise. Under these conditions usually about 50-60% of recovered activity was <br><br> enzyme C (Fig 1 a). Overall recovery was 70-80%. A enzyme was recon<br><br> 14 <br><br> stituted essentially as described . The flow through material from the <br><br> DEAE cellulose column after the urea treatment was loaded on to a 1 x 0. 8 cm phosphocellulose column, washed with 0.03 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, and the protein eluted with 0.25 M potassium phosphate, pH 7. 8. This material, the putative subunit, was vacuum dialysed with the C enzyme produced by the urea treatment, rechromatographed on DEAE cellulose and enzyme eluted batchwise (Fig 1 b). Recovery from this procedure was <br><br> usually 50-70% A enzyme. Overall recovery was 30-40% of the C enzyme dialysed. If the material eluted from the phosphocellulose by the 0. 25 M potassium phosphate was heated to 90?C for 5 minutes prior to vacuum <br><br> dialysis with the C enzyme the recovery from the DEAE cellulose column <br><br> was significantly higher (60-70% of the original C enzyme activity), but all recoverable DNA polymerase activity was C enzyme. This, together with the fact that the 60 minute treatment with urea has, on occasions, given <br><br> rise to a 50% increase in DNA polymerase activity prior to loading on to the DEAE cellulose column, would indicate that A enzyme is less active on <br><br> activated DNA than is C enzyme. If the DEAE cellulose flow through material came from urea treatment of A2 enzyme then A2 was produced on reconstitution; if from A1 then A1 was produced. <br><br> Although the mild urea treatment of A has been used to prepare C of <br><br> 3344 <br><br> Nucleic Acids Research <br><br> b <br><br> 120       180 C <br><br> I         I    ^ <br><br> Figure la  DEAE cellulose chromatography after 2.4 M urea treatment. <br><br> 4, 5000 units, 4.4 mg of Fraction II A2 enzyme were incubated with urea at a final concentration of 2.4 M for 60 minutes at 0?C, loaded on to a 5 x 1.4 cm DEAE cellulose column, the column was washed with 0. 03 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.8 and a 200 ml standard phosphate gradient applied. 2.3 ml fractions were collected and 10 Rl assayed for 5 minutes.

Accord<br><br> ingly the urea conversion of A to C was investigated in the presence of certain protease inhibitors. The presence of the serine protease inhibitor <br><br> phenylmethylsulphonyl-fluoride in the incubation and chromatography buffers did not affect the conversion of A2to C (Fig 1 a). Likewise trasylol and Na-p Tosyl-L-lysine chloromethylketone HC1 had no effect. However, protease action could have occurred earlier in the purification procedure and the urea could be separating two fragments. Usually the DEAE cellulose profile shows that the majority of the enzyme activity is present as A <br><br> enzyme (Fig 2). In this instance A1 and A2 have not been separated. When the temperature of the material in the original blending procedure was kept below 0?C or phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride, N-a-p Tosyl-L-lysine chloromethylketone HCl or trasylol was included in the isolation buffers the DEAE cellulose profile was similar. The A enzymes were still capable of conversion by mild urea treatment to C enzyme, indicating that if protease activity is involved then it is not susceptible to these inhibitors.

The presence of phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride, N- a-p T osyl- L-lysine <br><br> chloromethylketone HCl or trasylol under these conditions only had a marginal effect on the appearance of C enzyme, but did reduce the amount of B <br><br> enzyme. Heating the enzyme to 37?C after the phosphocellulose step had no effect on the DEAE cellulose elution profile. Attempts to convert A enzyme to C using trypsin have not been successful. A enzyme activity is lost without the appearance of any other species (unpublished observation), although <br><br> 14 the action of trypsin on C enzyme can give rise to small amounts of B <br><br> Although the conversion of A enzyme to C does not appear to be the result of serine protease action, proteases other than serine proteases <br><br> 18 <br><br> could have been responsible  . Also, the fact that A enzyme can be recon<br><br> stituted from C plus the flow through material from the DEAE cellulose after urea treatment does not necessarily mean we are dealing with two subunits as fragments produced by proteases mray be reassembled to give active <br><br> enzyme 9    . However, the fact that a 200-230, 000 molecular weight polypeptide band has never been observed in sodium dodecylsulphate polyacrylamride gels of highly purified A enzyme , or even cruder fractions of A <br><br> enzyrre (unpublished observation), may be significant. One might expect <br><br> some of the enzyme not to have been attacked by whatever is responsible for cleaving the molecule, if, indeed, this does happen. It would appear, therefore, that the A enzyme consists of subunits of 155, 000 and 50-70, 000 molecular weight with the small subunit having a slightly different charge in the <br><br> case of A  and A2. It has also been concluded that the heterogeneity in the <br><br> 1                                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~3 <span class="yellow">mouse</span> myeloma DNA polymerase a fraction is not due to proteolysis . However, the 50-70, 000 molecular weight subunit has not yet been identified. <br><br> Sodiurrm dodecylsulphate polyacrylamide gels of reconstituted A enzyme have shown polypeptide bands at 150-160, 000 and 50-70, 000 molecular weight <br><br> (Fig. 3), but the ratio of staining intensity of the bands does not correspond to a 1: 1 relationship. The ratio of the two bands is variable but is usually between 1:2 and 1:3, indicating, perhaps, that more than one subunit of 50<br><br> 3347 <br><br> Nucleic Acids Research <br><br> TOP      123   4 5   6 <br><br> Figure 3  Scan of a 5% sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel of <br><br> reconstituted A2 enzyme. 1500 units of reconstituted A2 enzyme were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions. The gels were sliced, enzyme extracted and assayed and the peak <br><br> fraction of DNA polymerase activity from three gels were pooled, subjected to sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a single <br><br> gel, stained and scanned at 2 volt sensitivity as described2. The molecular weight standards were: (1) <span class="yellow">bovine</span> serum albumin dimer (134, 000), (2) ,3 galactosidase (130, 000), (3) phosphorylase a (94, 000), (4) <span class="yellow">bovine</span> serum <br><br> albumin (68, 000), (5) pyruvate kinase (57, 000) and (6) lactate dehydrogenase (35, 000). <br><br> 70, 000 molecular weight can associate with the 155, 000 subunit. The proportion of the lower molecular weight polypeptide band is higher in the reconstituted A enzyrrme than in the C enzyme preparation from which it was formed, but even the C enzyme contained some material in the region. <br><br> Breakdown of material from 155, 000 to 50-70, 000 may be partly responsible for the contamination, but the presence of phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride in samples in preparation for sodium dodecylsulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis has not been successful in preventing it. The <span class="yellow">human</span> KB cell <br><br> DNA polymerase a, equivalent to the C enzyme, has been reported to consist <br><br> 4 <br><br> of subunits of 76, 000 and 66, 000 molecular weight , but at no time have we <br><br> observed polypeptide bands at 76, 000 and 66, 000 rising and falling with <br><br> enzyme activity in any gels of <span class="yellow">calf</span> thyrrmus enzymes A1, A  and C (and <br><br> 2 unpublished observations). (b)    Template Studies <br><br> Use has been made of the urea conversion of A to C and of the reconstitution of A enzyme to obtain samples of highly purified DNA polymerase, <br><br> specific activity in excess of 50, 000 units/mg, in order to study the effect of this 50-70, 000 molecular weight subunit on the DNA polymerase subunit. Previous results have indicated that A enzyrrme is stabler to heat and less <br><br> 3348 <br><br> Nucleic Acids Research <br><br> 14, 21 <br><br> susceptible to N-ethylmaleimide than C enzyme  . It has been reported <br><br> that highly purified DNA polymerase a can be associated with a protein capable of binding to DNA containing no 3' OH ends and capable of being released during the DNA polymerase assay  . Attempts to dissociate the 50<br><br> 70, 000 molecular weight subunit from the polymerase subunit by incubating A2 with DNA polymerase reaction mixes containing activated DNA, poly <br><br> (dA-T) and poly (dT). oligo (A)10 followed by ultracentrifugation in high salt have been unsuccessful. Similarly A absorbed and eluted from either native or denatured DNA cellulose remained A enzyme. Both A and C enzymes <br><br> were eluted from the DNA celluloses by less than 0. 1 M NaCl so it does not appear that the subunit enhances the binding of the DNA polymerase subunit to DNA. However, there are differences in the response of A and C <br><br> enzymes to synthetic template-initiator complexes (Table 1). Even if one takes into account the fact that A enzyme is less active on activated DNA <br><br> than C enzyme (the addition of the 50-70, 000 subunit to the polymerase subunit appears to result in a decrease of about 30% of polymerase activity on activated DNA) the A enzyme is still more active on these templates. <br><br> Although there is a variation in activity on these template-initiator comp<br><br> lexes each time assays are carried out on them depending on the method of preparing the complexes and the base ratio of template to initiator, A enzyme always seems to be significantly more active than C. The A2 <br><br> enzyme at pH 7.8, with extra subunit(s) is clearly more effective on the <br><br> oligoribonucleotide initiator, oligo(A)10 than is enzyme C. In view of the proposed RNA initiation of Okazaki pieces this may indicate a role of this subunit in Okazaki piece synthesis, in that it may aid the DNA polymerase to'take over' from the RNA polymerase.

Abstract
Background
The syndrome of arachnomelia is an inherited malformation mainly of limbs, back and head in <span class="yellow">cattle</span>. At present the arachnomelia syndrome has been well known mainly in Brown Swiss <span class="yellow">cattle</span>. Nevertheless, the arachnomelia syndrome had been observed in the Hessian Simmental population during the decade 1964–1974. Recently, stillborn Simmental <span class="blue">calves</span> were observed having a morphology similar to the arachnomelia syndrome. The goal of this work was the characterization of the morphology and genealogy of the syndrome in Simmental to establish the basis for an effective management of the disease.<br><br>Results
The first pathologically confirmed arachnomelia syndrome-cases in the current Simmental population appeared in the year 2005. By 2007, an additional 140 <span class="blue">calves</span> with the arachnomelia syndrome were identified. The major pathological findings were malformed bones affecting the head, long bones of the legs and the vertebral column. It could be shown that, with the exception of two cases that were considered as phenocopies, all of the paternal and about two-third of the maternal pedigrees of the affected <span class="blue">calves</span> could be traced back to one common founder. Together with the data from experimental matings, the pedigree data support an autosomal recessive mutation being the etiology of the arachnomelia syndrome. The frequency of the mutation in the current population was estimated to be 3.32%.<br><br>Conclusion
We describe the repeated occurrence of the arachnomelia syndrome in Simmental <span class="blue">calves</span>. It resembles completely the same defect occurring in the Brown Swiss breed. The mutation became relatively widespread amongst the current population. Therefore, a control system has to be established and it is highly desirable to map the disease and develop a genetic test system.<br><br><br><br>Background
In the year 2006 a syndrome was described in the German and Austrian Simmental (Fleckvieh, as it is locally called, is the main dual-purpose breed in Germany, in short called Simmental in the further text) population, that was pathologically similar to the arachnomelia syndrome in Brown Swiss <span class="yellow">cattle</span> [1]. The congenital arachnomelia syndrome (AS, OMIA Phene ID 139, Group 000059) is mainly a malformation of the skeletal system in <span class="yellow">cattle</span> that was initially described by Rieck and Schade [2] in Holstein Friesian, Red Holstein and Simmental.
The main pathological changes are skeletal malformations of the legs, the spinal column and the skull. The legs are thinner and appear longer than normal (dolichostenomelia, arachnomelia) since the diameter of the diaphyses is reduced. These long bones are more fragile and, in combination with stiffened joints, they tend to fracture during calving. The fetlock joints are deformed, often stiffened and show hyperextension. The malformation of the spinal column leads to kyphosis and scoliosis. The skull malformations are characterized by a shortened lower jaw (brachygnathia inferior), convex rounding of the frontal bone leading to a marked stop ("pointer head") and rotation of the anterior cranium. In some cases, additional malformations like hydrocephalus externus develop [2-5].
Since the report of Rieck and Schade [2] no further cases were reported in Simmental <span class="yellow">cattle</span>, but in the 1980s the syndrome was dispersed in another breed, the European Brown Swiss <span class="yellow">cattle</span>, by the use of American Brown Swiss sires [4,6]. In Brown Swiss an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance was supposed and a control program based on the identification of carriers by pedigree analyses was established [5]. Recently, four cases of arachnomelia syndrome were reported in Italy [3].
In this study, we present the data of 152 pathologically confirmed cases of arachnomelia syndrome in Simmental that were collected from October 2005 to March 2007. We describe the pathological findings, the familial occurrence and an estimate of the frequency of the diseases allele in Simmental <span class="yellow">cattle</span>. Additional support for the mode of inheritance and the genetic basis of the arachnomelia syndrome is given by the result of experimental matings of obligate carriers.<br><br>Results and discussion
AS has not been reported again in Simmental since its first description in the 1970s, more than thirteen years ago. In autumn 2004 a number of stillborn <span class="blue">calves</span> with similar malformations of the legs and head were recorded within the monitoring system of anomalies in Simmental. Some of these <span class="blue">calves</span> were sent to the veterinary service laboratory for examination, and in December 2005 the first 15 cases of AS were pathologically confirmed. Subsequently, farmers and veterinarians had been encouraged to report cases by an information leaflet and various articles in local trade journals. An increasing number of suspected cases was reported and an additional 136 affected <span class="blue">calves</span> were identified by pathological examination by June 2007.
Familial occurrence and case presentation of the syndrome of arachnomelia
The geographical origins of the cases were the southern part of Germany and Austria, reflecting the regional distribution of the Simmental breed. Both sexes were equally represented in the 152 (80 male, 72 female, χ2 = 0.21, p = 0.64) affected <span class="blue">calves</span>. The largest number of cases was registered in 2006 (Figure 1). In retrospect, it could be shown that the main reason for the rapid increase of cases in the years 2005 and 2006 was the high popularity of certain sires carrying the AS mutation (ROMEL, ISO-Nr. 276000911043667, born in 1995; EGEL, 276000915512806, 1985; REXON, 276000913008210, 1989). The latter two sires represent the key-nodes of the pedigree pathways of the mutation from the founder into the current population (Figure 2). ROMEL, for example, sired more than 40,000 <span class="yellow">cows</span> 4 to 6 years ago. Furthermore, 115 sons of ROMEL born from 2001 to 2005 are registered and listed in the breeding database [7]. These progeny were now mated to ROMEL and sons or grandsons of EGEL and REXON resulting in a high probability for the occurrence of affected <span class="blue">calves</span>. Increasing awareness of the disease and abandoning of selling the semen from carriers led to a sharp drop of cases in 2007. The disease was successfully managed by efficient collaboration of the Institute for Animal Breeding of the Bavarian State Research Centre for Agriculture (LfL), the Landeskuratorium der Erzeugerringe für tierische Veredelung in Bayern e.V (LKV), the Bavarian Animal Health Service (TGD) and breeding organizations.<br><br>Pathological findings
<span class="yellow">Calves</span> under suspicion of the arachnomelia syndrome were sent to the pathology department of the TGD for macroscopic examination. The observed major pathological findings were (1) facial deformation, including brachygnathia inferior and concave rounding of the maxilla forming a dent ('pointer-head'); (2) abnormally thin diaphyses of the long bones (the outer diameter of the diaphyses is diminished, whereas the width of the substantia compacta is normal) leading to frequent fractures of the metacarpus and metatarsus in the course of forced birth assistance ('spider-legs', dolichostenomelia). The deformations of other bones of the legs were less apparent and the scapula was usually unaffected; (3) angular deformations of the distal parts of the legs characterized by bilateral stiff and hyperextended fetlocks with the extremity of the toe forward and parallel to the trunk of the body; and (4) defects of the vertebral column (kyphosis and scoliosis), but not of the ribs (Figure 3A–C). Additionally, inconsistent pathological findings included cerebral herniation combined with a malformed foramen magnum, microphthalmia, and external and internal hydrocephalus. The latter seem to develop secondarily, due to the enlarged foramen magnum.
Histological examination of selected cases revealed the presence of hemorrhages at the osteochondral junction of the epiphysis and an abrupt transmission from chondral to osteogenic tissue.
Cases never showed isolated malformations, e.g. of the head or legs, but usually a combination of all pathological findings that are characteristic for the syndrome. Nevertheless, the degree of the lesions ranged from obvious spider-leg cases to moderate or mild changes, making a definite diagnosis difficult. The latter cases (3) were excluded from the initial pedigree analyses. Meanwhile, an indirect gene test is available that has been developed at the Institute for Animal Breeding of the Bavarian State Research Centre for Agriculture (ITZ) and it could be shown that these cases are most probably not genetically affected (Buitkamp et al., in preparation).<br><br>Carrier identification
Two criteria were used for carrier identification. The first was the presence of a <span class="yellow">calf</span> that was diagnosed by pathological investigation. In many cases more than one affected <span class="yellow">calf</span> per sire was identified [8]. Some sires had only one affected <span class="yellow">calf</span>, but a large number of risk-matings. In these cases a second criterion, the statistical evaluation of risk-matings, was used to identify potential phenocopies. For this purpose, the probability of observing only a single affected <span class="yellow">calf</span> among a certain number of risk-matings of the sire in question was calculated. Risk-matings were defined as matings with direct progenies of identified AS carriers. The probability of observing an affected <span class="yellow">calf</span> depends also on the probability that such a <span class="yellow">calf</span> is reported to the LKV. We assumed this probability to be 50%. Under these conditions, the probability of observing only one affected <span class="yellow">calf</span> is lower than 1.0 percent, if at least 104 risk-matings are given for a single sire. In this case it is very likely that the single affected <span class="yellow">calf</span> is a phenocopy. In 2006 and 2007 this was the case for two sires used for artificial insemination that had no pedigree connection to SEMPER (see below).<br><br>Experimental matings of obligate carriers
Four out of seven <span class="yellow">cows</span> that were known AS carriers brought to the facilities of the ITZ were used for embryo transfer (Table 1). 33 of the 60 recipients (55%) were confirmed pregnant on day 35. Four of the 33 pregnant heifers (12%) aborted between days 36 and 49 of pregnancy. Of the remaining 29 recipients, 6 were slaughtered on day 150, 6 on day 200, and 17 animals on day 225 of pregnancy (Table 1). Four fetuses (three male and one female) out of 29 (14%) showed the typical pathological changes of the arachnomelia syndrome as described above (Figure 4C,D). All other fetuses showed no signs of AS (Figure 4A,B).
Male fetuses represented 76% (22 of 29) of pregnancies (χ2 = 3.123, p = 0.077, Yates corrected for sample size <30). Female weight (Table 2), crown-rump length at day 225 and chest circumference at day 225 of normal fetuses were lower than that of male fetuses. Fetuses that were affected by the arachnomelia syndrome showed lower weight than normal fetuses. The affected and the normal fetuses had similar crown-rump length, but the chest circumference of affected fetuses was higher than that of normal fetuses (Table 2). Due to the small number of affected female fetuses, a comparison with unaffected animals for sex was not possible. To compare unaffected and affected animals in total, the data were analyzed for statistical differences by the non parametric Mann-Whitney-Test. The only trait that was significantly different between unaffected and affected fetuses was the chest circumference (p = 0.004, Table 2). The body weight of AS affected <span class="blue">calves</span> was tendentially lower than that of normal <span class="blue">calves</span>. Since affected <span class="blue">calves</span> did not have different crown-rump-length and their chest circumference was even higher, this can best be explained by a reduced bone mass.<br><br>Pedigree Analysis and mode of inheritance
Eight-generation pedigrees of all cases were extracted from the joint German and Austria pedigree data and screened for common ancestors. The pedigree of the majority of affected <span class="blue">calves</span> (paternal line 150, maternal line 106 out of 152, Table 3) could be traced back to one founder, SEMPER (ISO-Nr. 27000979299305), a sire born in 1964, 6–9 generations before the affected <span class="blue">calves</span> were born (Figure 2). Most of the affected <span class="blue">calves</span> inherited the AS mutation via REXON or EGEL (Table 3, Figure 2). In 44 cases the maternal paths were not linked to the common pedigree (Table 3). One explanation would be the existence of additional, hereto unknown origins of the mutation. This could happen if the AS mutation is much more ancient and additional pedigree paths exist or if an independent mutation event happened leading to the same phenotype. An alternative, more plausible explanation could be the occurrence of misparentages. It is well known that in the pre parentage-test era, the frequency of false paternity, especially of the <span class="yellow">cows</span>, was reasonable high (up to 23% [9]). Therefore, there is a good chance of a false registry within 6–9 generations.
There is strong support for the assumption that the AS is regulated by a single autosomal locus acting in a recessive manner. First of all, the pedigree structure of the affected <span class="blue">calves</span> in Simmental can best be explained by a recessive mode of inheritance. The paternal branch of the pedigree could be traced back to one sire, SEMPER, for all affected <span class="blue">calves</span>, the maternal branch in the majority of the cases. Inbreeding loops over a few generations are present in several pedigrees of affected <span class="blue">calves</span>, e.g. cases P3364 and P1787 (Figure 2). Sex-dependent inheritance can obviously be excluded and a dominant mode with reduced penetrance seems to be unlikely. Secondly, the experimental matings resulted in 4 affected and 25 unaffected fetuses, a result that most closely resembles the expectation of a recessive mode of inheritance. Thirdly, the occurrence of cases corresponded well with the numbers expected under the assumption of a recessively acting mutation. We tested this on the progeny of ROMEL, the largest dataset available from one carrier. We analyzed the period from the beginning of the recording system for malformations to May 2007. In that period 44,170 <span class="blue">calves</span> were born that were sired by ROMEL. From these, 662 were considered as risk pairings, i.e. the mother had a risk of 0.5 to be a carrier (i.e. one of the grandparents was an obligate carrier) and 35 <span class="blue">calves</span> out of these were diagnosed as affected. Since it is expected that about 1/2 to 1/3 of the affected <span class="blue">calves</span> were recorded, this result is very close to the expected 1:7 ratio of affected to unaffected <span class="blue">calves</span>. Moreover, these findings are concordant with the historical description of the arachnomelia syndrome in Simmental [2] and the analyses of cases in Brown Swiss [5]. Finally, when applying linkage analyses using microsatellite markers, evaluations with a model assuming recessive autosomal inheritance gave the highest lod scores (Buitkamp et al., in preparation).<br><br>Allelic frequency of carriers in the present Simmental <span class="yellow">cow</span> population
Since the arachnomelia syndrome-allele was passed to the current population through two parental lines (REXON and EGEL) and the main carriers are known, it is possible to estimate the frequency of the disease allele by an allele-counting method [10]. The allelic frequency was calculated for all <span class="yellow">cows</span> from the breeding population who were alive in June 2007. In 10.4 percent of the pedigrees of 540,725 <span class="yellow">cows</span> an identified carrier was found and the probability that individual <span class="yellow">cows</span> were carrier of the arachnomelia syndrome-allele was calculated. E.g. in 14,740 and 41,032 cases a known carrier appeared as sire and grandsire, respectively. In these cases the probability of transmitting the allele is 50 and 25 percent, respectively, if no further carrier is present in the two generation pedigree. The averaged rate of the arachnomelia syndrome carriers based on known carriers over all <span class="yellow">cows</span> alive in Bavarian Simmental was 3.32 percent.
Using this approach, the frequency of carriers was calculated for each year (always based on the actual datasets from August 2008) from 2003 to 2008 (Figure 1). The calculations were done twice, considering all known carriers together, and also by using only ROMEL as a carrier to show the numeric contribution of his progeny (Figure 1). For these analyses, the sires that are designated to be non-carriers by the number of risk pairings without having a case or the indirect gene test are set as non-carrier. Therefore, these frequencies are slightly lower than the initial frequency estimate of 3.32 percent.<br><br>
Conclusion
The cases of malformed Simmental <span class="blue">calves</span> presented here showed the same morphology described in the arachnomelia syndrome in Brown Swiss [e.g. [3]], even though there is a certain morphological variation from mild to severe malformations. The main findings, brachygnathia inferior and convex frontal bone of the face, deformation of vertebrae, and dysplasia of the limbs, namely the diaphyses of metatarsus and -carpus and the fetlocks, can best be explained by irregularly developed bone structure at the corresponding locations.
Without pathological examination it is difficult to distinguish the arachnomelia syndrome from other malformations of the limbs. Therefore, low numbers of cases in Simmental probably passed unrecognized before 2005. In that year the allelic frequency of the disease in the <span class="yellow">cow</span> population increased sharply because some sires that had been carriers of the mutation had become very popular 2–4 years before.
The identification of a common ancestor, the results from the experimental matings and the analyses of numbers of cases from risk matings strongly support the hypothesis of an autosomal recessively inherited disease. Furthermore, this assumption is concordant with the historical description of the syndrome in Simmental and Brown Swiss. The allelic frequency of the arachnomelia syndrome in the current population is well above 3 percent and a substantial number of progeny from known carriers with superior genetic merit shall be used as sires during the next years. Therefore, a control system has to be established and the arachnomelia syndrome-gene should be mapped as a prerequisite for the development of an indirect gene test for carrier identification. The availability of pathologically well characterized cases from the field and from the ET-generated full-sib families will be an excellent material for a genetic mapping procedure.<br><br>Methods
Recording system for congenital malformations
A system for monitoring inherited congenital malformations in Bavarian <span class="yellow">cattle</span> populations was established by the Institute for Animal Breeding of the Bavarian State Research Centre for Agriculture (ITZ) in cooperation with the Bavarian milk recording organization (LKV) [11]. In short, a questionnaire was developed for detailed recording of malformed <span class="blue">calves</span>. The malformation was described according to its location (e.g. head, legs) and its characteristics (e.g. hernia). The standardized data were stored in a database at the LKV, that is evaluated monthly for a potential genetic background of malformations.
Sires that fit into the pedigree (progeny of REXON or EGEL) with at least one affected <span class="yellow">calf</span> with confirmed paternity were defined as obligate carriers and marked in the breeding information system [7]. In cases without connection to the pedigree and only one recorded <span class="yellow">calf</span> the number of "risk pairings" (matings to <span class="yellow">cows</span> where at least one parent is a known carrier, enabling the calculation of the probability for the occurrence of cases) was calculated. When the probability that a case occurs was above 99% for the sire in question the case was considered to be a phenocopy. The number of <span class="blue">calves</span> affected by the arachnomelia syndrome and their parentage is routinely published [8].<br><br>Pathological examinations
Pathological examinations followed standard procedures. <span class="yellow">Calves</span> were photographed and size and weight measurements were recorded. Tissue specimens from the condyle (epiphysis) and from the diaphysis of the femur were collected for histological examination. Specimens were fixed in 10% formalin and kept in a decalcifying solution (Ossafixonafor) for 24 hours. Thereafter, specimens were processed in an automated embedding system, sectioned at 4–6 microns and finally stained with haematoxyline and eosin.<br><br>Experimental matings and embryo transfer
Known carriers of the arachnomelia syndrome (seven <span class="yellow">cows</span> that had produced at least one affected <span class="yellow">calf</span>) were brought to the facilities of the ITZ for embryo transfer (Table 1). Late morulae and blastocysts collected on day 7 (day 0 = estrus) from superovulated donor <span class="yellow">cows</span> were nonsurgically transferred to heifers [12].<br><br>Mode of inheritance and allele frequency
The pedigree of all cases was constructed from the pedigree that is used for the joint breeding evaluation of Germany and Austria. The graphical presentation of the pedigree was performed with the Pedigraph TM software [13]. The allelic frequency of the AS mutation in the current <span class="yellow">cow</span> population was estimated from ancestors with known genotypes following the allele-counting method [10]. For this reason two generation pedigrees of herd book <span class="yellow">cows</span> in Bavarian Simmental were analyzed for obligate carriers. We considered all <span class="yellow">cows</span> that were alive in June 2007 and included in the herd book. All animals were bred by the use of artificial insemination.<br><br>Statistical analyses
The non parametric Mann-Whitney-Test was performed using SPSS Version 14.0, the Chi-square test was performed using R 2.4.0 [14].<br><br>
