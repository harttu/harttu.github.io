<h2>Aedes aegypti mosquitoes</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21114562</h3>Improved accuracy of the transcriptional profiling method of age grading in <span class="blue">Aedes aegypti mosquitoes</span> under laboratory and semi-field cage conditions and in the presence of Wolbachia infection. 

Transcriptional profiling is an effective method of predicting age in the mosquito <span class="yellow">Aedes aegypti</span> in the laboratory, however, its effectiveness is limited to younger mosquitoes. To address this we used a microarray to identify new gene candidates that show significant expression changes in older mosquitoes. These genes were then used to create a revised model, which upon evaluation in both laboratory and semi-field conditions, proved to have improved accuracy overall and for older mosquitoes. In association with the development of symbiont-based control strategies for <span class="yellow">Ae. aegypti</span>, we also tested the model's accuracy for Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes and found no decline in performance. Our findings suggest that the new model is a robust and powerful tool for age determination in Australian <span class="yellow">Ae. aegypti</span> populations.
