<h2>fungal</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20044015</h3>Characterizing the role of the microtubule binding protein Bim1 in <span class="yellow">Cryptococcus neoformans</span>. 

During sexual development the <span class="yellow">human</span> <span class="red">fungal</span> pathogen <span class="yellow">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> undergoes a developmental transition from yeast-form growth to filamentous growth. This transition requires cellular restructuring to form a filamentous dikaryon. Dikaryotic growth also requires tightly controlled nuclear migration to ensure faithful replication and dissemination of genetic material to spore progeny. Although the gross morphological changes that take place during dikaryotic growth are largely known, the molecular underpinnings that control this process are uncharacterized. Here we identify and characterize a <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span> homolog of the <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> BIM1 gene, and establish the importance of BIM1 for proper filamentous growth of <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span>. Deletion of BIM1 leads to truncated sexual development filaments, a severe defect in diploid formation, and a block in monokaryotic fruiting. Our findings lead to a model consistent with a critical role for BIM1 in both filament integrity and nuclear congression that is mediated through the microtubule cytoskeleton. 
<h3>20433937</h3>Fungal secondary metabolites - strategies to activate silent gene clusters.

Filamentous fungi produce a multitude of low molecular weight bioactive compounds. The increasing number of <span class="red">fungal</span> genome sequences impressively demonstrated that their biosynthetic potential is far from being exploited. In fungi, the genes required for the biosynthesis of a secondary metabolite are clustered. Many of these bioinformatically newly discovered secondary metabolism gene clusters are silent under standard laboratory conditions. Consequently, no product can be found. This review summarizes the current strategies that have been successfully applied during the last years to activate these silent gene clusters in filamentous fungi, especially in the genus Aspergillus. The techniques take advantage of genome mining, vary from the simple search for compounds with bioinformatically predicted physicochemical properties up to methods that exploit a probable interaction of microorganisms. Until now, the majority of successful approaches have been based on molecular biology like the generation of gene &quot;knock outs&quot;, promoter exchange, overexpression of transcription factors or other pleiotropic regulators. Moreover, strategies based on epigenetics opened a new avenue for the elucidation of the regulation of secondary metabolite formation and will certainly continue to play a significant role for the elucidation of cryptic natural products. The conditions under which a given gene cluster is naturally expressed are largely unknown. One technique is to attempt to simulate the natural habitat by co-cultivation of microorganisms from the same ecosystem. This has already led to the activation of silent gene clusters and the identification of novel compounds in <span class="yellow">Aspergillus nidulans</span>. These simulation strategies will help discover new natural products in the future, and may also provide fundamental new insights into microbial communication. 
<h3>20519150</h3>The lipid language of plant-fungal interactions.

Lipid mediated cross-kingdom communication between hosts and pathogens is a rapidly emerging field in molecular plant-fungal interactions. Amidst our growing understanding of <span class="red">fungal</span> and plant chemical cross-talk lies the distinct, yet little studied, role for a group of oxygenated lipids derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids, termed oxylipins. Endogenous <span class="red">fungal</span> oxylipins are known for their roles in carrying out pathogenic strategies to successfully colonize their host, reproduce, and synthesize toxins. While plant oxylipins also have functions in reproduction and development, they are largely recognized as agents that facilitate resistance to pathogen attack. Here we review the composition and endogenous functions of oxylipins produced by both plants and fungi and introduce evidence which suggests that <span class="red">fungal</span> pathogens exploit host oxylipins to facilitate their own virulence and pathogenic development. Specifically, we describe how fungi induce plant lipid metabolism to utilize plant oxylipins in order to promote G-protein-mediated regulation of sporulation and mycotoxin production in the fungus. The use of host-ligand mimicry (i.e. coronatine) to manipulate plant defense responses that benefit the fungus are also implicated. 
<h3>20659575</h3>Regulation of secondary metabolism by chromatin structure and epigenetic codes.

Chromatin, composed of DNA wrapped around an octamer of histones, is the relevant substrate for all genetic processes in eukaryotic nuclei. Changes in chromatin structure are associated with the activation and silencing of gene transcription and reversible post-translational modifications of histones are now known to direct chromatin structure transitions. Recent studies in several <span class="red">fungal</span> species have identified a chromatin-based regulation of secondary metabolism (SM) gene clusters representing an upper-hierarchical level for the coordinated control of large chromosomal elements. Regulation by chromatin transition processes provides a mechanistic model to explain how different SM clusters located at dispersed genomic regions can be simultaneously silenced during primary metabolism. Activation of SM clusters has been shown to be associated with increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4 and, consequently, inhibition of histone de-acetylase activities also leads to increased production of secondary metabolites. New findings suggest that SM clusters are silenced by heterochromatic histone marks and that the &quot;closed&quot; heterochromatic structures are reversed during SM activation. This process is mediated by the conserved activator of SM, LaeA. Despite the increase in knowledge about these processes, much remains to be learned from chromatin-level regulation of SM. For example, which proteins &quot;position&quot; the chromatin restructuring signal onto SM clusters or how exactly LaeA works to mediate the low level of heterochromatic marks inside different clusters remain open questions. Answers to these and other chromatin-related questions would certainly complete our understanding of SM gene regulation and signaling and, because for many predicted SM clusters corresponding products have not been identified so far, anti-silencing strategies would open new ways for the identification of novel bioactive substances. 
<h3>20807586</h3>Fungal secondary metabolites as modulators of interactions with insects and other arthropods. 

Fungi share a diverse co-evolutionary history with animals, especially arthropods. In this review, we focus on the role of secondary metabolism in driving antagonistic arthropod-fungus interactions, i.e., where fungi serve as a food source to <span class="red">fungal</span> grazers, compete with saprophagous insects, and attack insects as hosts for growth and reproduction. Although a wealth of studies on animal-fungus interactions point to a crucial role of secondary metabolites in deterring animal feeding and resisting immune defense strategies, causal evidence often remains to be provided. Moreover, it still remains an unresolved puzzle as to what extent the tight regulatory control of secondary metabolite formation in some model fungi represents an evolved chemical defense system favored by selective pressure through animal antagonists. Given these gaps in knowledge, we highlight some co-evolutionary aspects of secondary metabolism, such as induced response, volatile signaling, and experimental evolution, which may help in deciphering the ecological importance and evolutionary history of secondary metabolite production in fungi. 
<h3>20816830</h3>Cross-talk between light and glucose regulation controls toxin production and morphogenesis in <span class="yellow">Aspergillus nidulans</span>. 

Light is a major environmental stimulus that has a broad effect on organisms, triggering a cellular response that results in an optimal adaptation enhancing fitness and survival. In fungi, light affects growth, and causes diverse morphological changes such as those leading to reproduction. Light can also affect <span class="red">fungal</span> metabolism, including the biosynthesis of natural products. In this study we show that in <span class="yellow">Aspergillus nidulans</span> the effect of light on the production of the sterigmatocystin (ST) toxin depends on the glucose concentration. In cultures grown with 1% glucose and exposed to light, ST production was lower than when grown in the dark. This lower ST production coincided with an elevated rate of cellular damage with partial loss of nuclear integrity and vacuolated cytoplasm. However, in cultures grown with 2% glucose these effects were reversed and light enhanced ST production. Glucose abundance also affected the light-dependent subcellular localization of the VeA (velvet) protein, a key regulator necessary for normal light-dependent morphogenesis and secondary metabolism in Aspergilli and other <span class="red">fungal</span> genera. The role of other VeA-associated proteins, particularly the blue-light-sensing proteins LreA and LreB (WC-1 and WC-2 orthologs), on conidiation could also be modified by the abundance of glucose. We also show that LreA and LreB, as well as the phytochrome FphA, modulate not only the synthesis of sterigmatocystin, but also the production of the antibiotic penicillin. 
<h3>20880038</h3>Evidence for functional divergence in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi from contrasting climatic origins. 

A considerable amount of phenotypic, genetic and symbiotic functional variability has been documented in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). However, little is known about whether distinct AMF ecotypes have evolved within their geographic range. We tested the hypothesis that AMF growing at temperatures closer to those prevalent within their origin would benefit their host and grow more than isolates distant from their native conditions. For each of six AMF species, we chose pairs of isolates that originated from distant areas with contrasting climates. Each isolate was grown in association with two grass species of different thermal optima at two temperature settings. Thus, we also tested whether AMF from different climatic origins were dependent on the thermal adaptation of the host plant species or to temperature per se. Although <span class="red">fungal</span> growth was not directly affected by temperature, we found that AMF isolates originating from contrasting climates consistently and differentially altered plant growth. Our results suggest that AMF from contrasting climates have altered symbiotic function, thus linking an abiotic factor to ecotypic differentiation of putatively important symbionts. 
<h3>20880225</h3>Recovery of ectomycorrhiza after 'nitrogen saturation' of a conifer forest.

Trees reduce their carbon (C) allocation to roots and mycorrhizal fungi in response to high nitrogen (N) additions, which should reduce the N retention capacity of forests. The time needed for recovery of mycorrhizas after termination of N loading remains unknown. Here, we report the long-term impact of N loading and the recovery of ectomycorrhiza after high N loading on a <span class="yellow">Pinus sylvestris</span> forest. We analysed the N% and abundance of the stable isotope (15) N in tree needles and soil, soil microbial fatty acid biomarkers and <span class="red">fungal</span> DNA. Needles in N-loaded plots became enriched in (15) N, reflecting decreased N retention by mycorrhizal fungi and isotopic discrimination against (15) N during loss of N. Meanwhile, needles in N-limited (control) plots became depleted in (15) N, reflecting high retention of (15) N by mycorrhizal fungi. N loading was terminated after 20yr. The delta(15) N and N% of the needles decreased 6yr after N loading had been terminated, and approached values in control plots after 15yr. This decrease, and the larger contributions compared with N-loaded plots of a <span class="red">fungal</span> fatty acid biomarker and ectomycorrhizal sequences, suggest recovery of ectomycorrhiza. High N loading rapidly decreased the functional role of ectomycorrhiza in the forest N cycle, but significant recovery occurred within 6-15yr after termination of N loading. 
<h3>20887797</h3>The FvMK1 mitogen-activated protein kinase gene regulates conidiation, pathogenesis, and fumonisin production in <span class="yellow">Fusarium verticillioides</span>. 

<span class="yellow">Fusarium verticillioides</span> is one of the most important <span class="red">fungal</span> pathogens to cause destructive diseases of <span class="yellow">maize</span> worldwide. Fumonisins produced by the fungus are harmful to <span class="yellow">human</span> and animal health. To date, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with pathogenicity and fumonisin biosynthesis in <span class="yellow">F. verticillioides</span> is limited. Because MAP kinase pathways have been implicated in regulating diverse processes important for plant infection in phytopathogenic fungi, in this study we identified and functionally characterized the FvMK1 gene in <span class="yellow">F. verticillioides</span>. FvMK1 is orthologous to FMK1 in <span class="yellow">F. oxysporum</span> and GPMK1 in <span class="yellow">F. graminearum</span>. The Fvmk1 deletion mutant was reduced in vegetative growth and production of microconidia. However, it was normal in sexual reproduction and increased in the production of macroconidia. In infection assays with developing <span class="yellow">corn</span> kernels, the Fvmk1 mutant was non-pathogenic and failed to colonize through wounding sites. It also failed to cause stalk rot symptoms beyond the inoculation sites on <span class="yellow">corn</span> stalks, indicating that FvMK1 is essential for plant infection. Furthermore, the Fvmk1 mutant was significantly reduced in fumonisin production and expression levels of FUM1 and FUM8, two genes involved in fumonisin biosynthesis. The defects of the Fvmk1 mutant were fully complemented by re-introducing the wild type FvMK1 allele. These results demonstrate that FvMK1 plays critical roles in the regulation of vegetative growth, asexual reproduction, fumonisin biosynthesis, and pathogenicity. 
<h3>20955813</h3>Comparative sequence analysis of <span class="yellow">wheat</span> and <span class="yellow">barley</span> powdery mildew fungi reveals gene colinearity, dates divergence and indicates host-pathogen co-evolution. 

The two <span class="red">fungal</span> pathogens <span class="yellow">Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici</span> (<span class="yellow">B.g. tritici</span>) and <span class="yellow">hordei</span> (<span class="yellow">B.g. hordei</span>) cause powdery mildew specifically in <span class="yellow">wheat</span> or <span class="yellow">barley</span>. They have the same life cycle, but their growth is restricted to the respective host. Here, we compared the sequences of two loci in both cereal mildews to determine their divergence time and their relationship with the evolution of their hosts. We sequenced a total of 273.3kb derived from <span class="yellow">B.g. tritici</span> BAC sequences and compared them with the orthologous regions in the <span class="yellow">B.g. hordei</span> genome. Protein-coding genes were colinear and well conserved. In contrast, the intergenic regions showed very low conservation mostly due to different integration patterns of transposable elements. To estimate the divergence time of <span class="yellow">B.g. tritici</span> and <span class="yellow">B.g. hordei</span>, we used conserved intergenic sequences including orthologous transposable elements. This revealed that <span class="yellow">B.g. tritici</span> and <span class="yellow">B.g. hordei</span> have diverged about 10 million years ago (MYA), two million years after <span class="yellow">wheat</span> and <span class="yellow">barley</span> (12 MYA). These data suggest that <span class="yellow">B.g. tritici</span> and <span class="yellow">B.g. hordei</span> have co-evolved with their hosts during most of their evolutionary history after host divergence, possibly after a short phase of host expansion when the same pathogen could still grow on the two diverged hosts. 
<h3>20961294</h3>Isolation and characterization of MAT genes in the symbiotic ascomycete <span class="yellow">Tuber melanosporum</span>. 

* The genome of <span class="yellow">Tuber melanosporum</span> has recently been sequenced. Here, we used this information to identify genes involved in the reproductive processes of this edible fungus. The sequenced strain (Mel28) possesses only one of the two master genes required for mating, that is, the gene that codes for the high mobility group (HMG) transcription factor (MAT1-2-1), whereas it lacks the gene that codes for the protein containing the alpha-box- domain (MAT1-1-1), suggesting that this fungus is heterothallic. * <span class="yellow">A</span> PCR-based approach was initially employed to screen truffles for the presence of the MAT1-2-1 gene and amplify the conserved regions flanking the mating type (MAT) locus. The MAT1-1-1 gene was finally identified using primers designed from the conserved regions of strains that lack the MAT1-2-1 gene. * Mating type-specific primer pairs were developed to screen asci and gleba from truffles of different origins and to genotype single ascospores within the asci. These analyses provided definitive evidence that <span class="yellow">T. melanosporum</span> is a heterothallic species with a MAT locus that is organized similarly to those of ancient <span class="red">fungal</span> lineages. * <span class="yellow">A</span> greater understanding of the reproductive mechanisms that exist in Tuber spp. allows for optimization of <span class="yellow">truffle</span> plantation management strategies. 
<h3>20965267</h3>Distribution and localization of microsatellites in the <span class="yellow">Perigord black truffle</span> genome and identification of new molecular markers. 

The level of genetic diversity and genetic structure in the <span class="yellow">Perigord black truffle</span> (<span class="yellow">Tuber melanosporum Vittad.</span>) has been debated for several years, mainly due to the lack of appropriate genetic markers. Microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are important for the genome organisation, phenotypic diversity and are one of the most popular molecular markers. In this study, we surveyed the <span class="yellow">T. melanosporum</span> genome (1) to characterise its SSR pattern; (2) to compare it with SSR patterns found in 48 other <span class="red">fungal</span> and three oomycetes genomes and (3) to identify new polymorphic SSR markers for population genetics. The <span class="yellow">T. melanosporum</span> genome is rich in SSRs with 22,425 SSRs with mono-nucleotides being the most frequent motifs. SSRs were found in all genomic regions although they are more frequent in non-coding regions (introns and intergenic regions). Sixty out of 135 PCR-amplified mono-, di-, tri-, tetra, penta, and hexa-nucleotides were polymorphic (44%) within <span class="yellow">black truffle</span> populations and 27 were randomly selected and analysed on 139 <span class="yellow">T. melanosporum</span> isolates from France, Italy and Spain. The number of alleles varied from 2 to 18 and the expected heterozygosity from 0.124 to 0.815. One hundred and thirty-two different multilocus genotypes out of the 139 <span class="yellow">T. melanosporum</span> isolates were identified and the genotypic diversity was high (0.999). Polymorphic SSRs were found in UTR regulatory regions of fruiting bodies and ectomycorrhiza regulated genes, suggesting that they may play a role in phenotypic variation. In conclusion, SSRs developed in this study were highly polymorphic and our results showed that <span class="yellow">T. melanosporum</span> is a species with an important genetic diversity, which is in agreement with its recently uncovered heterothallic mating system. 
<h3>20971906</h3>Plantazolicin, a novel microcin B17/streptolysin S-like natural product from <span class="yellow">Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42</span>. 

Here we report on a novel thiazole/oxazole-modified microcin (TOMM) from <span class="yellow">Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42</span>, a Gram-positive soil bacterium. This organism is well known for stimulating plant growth and biosynthesizing complex small molecules that suppress the growth of bacterial and <span class="red">fungal</span> plant pathogens. Like microcin B17 and streptolysin S, the TOMM from <span class="yellow">B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42</span> undergoes extensive posttranslational modification to become a bioactive natural product. Our data show that the modified peptide bears a molecular mass of 1,335 Da and displays antibacterial activity toward closely related Gram-positive bacteria. <span class="yellow">A</span> cluster of 12 genes that covers -10 kb is essential for the production, modification, export, and self-immunity of this natural product. We have named this compound plantazolicin (PZN), based on the association of several producing organisms with plants and the incorporation of azole heterocycles, which derive from Cys, Ser, and Thr residues of the precursor peptide. 
<h3>21073976</h3>FungiFun: a web-based application for functional categorization of <span class="red">fungal</span> genes and proteins. 

FungiFun assigns functional annotations to <span class="red">fungal</span> genes or proteins and performs gene set enrichment analysis. Based on three different classification methods (FunCat, GO and KEGG), FungiFun categorizes genes and proteins for several <span class="red">fungal</span> species on different levels of annotation detail. It is web-based and accessible to users without any programming skills. FungiFun is the first tool offering gene set enrichment analysis including the FunCat categorization. Two biological datasets for <span class="yellow">Aspergillus fumigatus</span> and <span class="yellow">Candida albicans</span> were analyzed using FungiFun, providing an overview of the usage and functions of the tool. FungiFun is freely accessible at https://www.omnifung.hki-jena.de/FungiFun/. 
<h3>21073977</h3>Cleavage of resveratrol in fungi: characterization of the enzyme Rco1 from <span class="yellow">Ustilago maydis</span>. 

<span class="yellow">Ustilago maydis</span>, the causative agent of <span class="yellow">corn smut</span> disease, contains two genes encoding members of the carotenoid cleavage oxygenase family, a group of enzymes that cleave double bonds in different substrates. One of them, Cco1, was formerly identified as a Beta-carotene cleaving enzyme. Here we elucidate the function of the protein encoded by the second gene, termed here as <span class="yellow">Ustilago maydis</span> Resveratrol cleavage oxygenase 1 (Um Rco1). In vitro incubations of heterologously expressed and purified UM Rco1 with different carotenoid and stilbene substrates demonstrate that it cleaves the interphenyl Calpha-CBeta double bond of the phytoalexin resveratrol and its derivative piceatannol. Um Rco1 exhibits a high degree of substrate specificity, as suggested by the lack of activity on carotenoids and the other resveratrol-related compounds tested. The activity of Um Rco1 was confirmed by incubation of <span class="yellow">U. maydis</span> rco1 deletion and over-expression strains with resveratrol. Furthermore, treatment with resveratrol resulted in striking alterations of cell morphology. However, pathogenicity assays indicated that Um rco1 is largely dispensable for biotrophic development. Our work reveals Um Rco1 as the first eukaryotic resveratrol cleavage enzyme identified so far. Moreover, Um Rco1 represents a subfamily of <span class="red">fungal</span> enzymes likely involved in the degradation of stilbene compounds, as suggested by the cleavage of resveratrol by homologs from <span class="yellow">Aspergillus fumigatus</span>, <span class="yellow">Chaetomium globosum</span> and <span class="yellow">Botryotinia fuckeliana</span>. 
<h3>21094264</h3>Genome-wide inventory of metal homeostasis-related gene products including a functional phytochelatin synthase in the hypogeous mycorrhizal fungus <span class="yellow">Tuber melanosporum</span>. 

Ectomycorrhizal fungi are thought to enhance mineral nutrition of their host plants and to confer increased tolerance toward toxic metals. However, a global view of metal homeostasis-related genes and pathways in these organisms is still lacking. Building upon the genome sequence of <span class="yellow">Tuber melanosporum</span> and on transcriptome analyses, we set out to systematically identify metal homeostasis-related genes in this plant-symbiotic ascomycete. Candidate gene products (101) were subdivided into three major functional classes: (i) metal transport (58); (ii) oxidative stress defence (32); (iii) metal detoxification (11). The latter class includes a small-size metallothionein (TmelMT) that was functionally validated in <span class="yellow">yeast</span>, and phytochelatin synthase (TmelPCS), the first enzyme of this kind to be described in filamentous ascomycetes. Recombinant TmelPCS was shown to support GSH-dependent, metal-activated phytochelatin synthesis in vitro and to afford increased Cd/Cu tolerance to metal hypersensitive <span class="yellow">yeast</span> strains. Metal transporters, especially those related to Cu and Zn trafficking, displayed the highest expression levels in mycorrhizae, suggesting extensive translocation of both metals to root cells as well as to <span class="red">fungal</span> metalloenzymes (e.g., laccase) that are strongly upregulated in symbiotic hyphae. 
<h3>21134480</h3>Perithecium morphogenesis in <span class="yellow">Sordaria macrospora</span>.

The perithecium of the self-fertile ascomycete <span class="yellow">Sordaria macrospora</span> provides an excellent model in which to analyse <span class="red">fungal</span> multicellular development. This study provides a detailed analysis of perithecium morphogenesis in the wild type and eight developmental mutants of <span class="yellow">S. macrospora</span>, using a range of correlative microscopical techniques. Fundamentally, perithecia and other complex multicellular structures produced by fungi arise by hyphal aggregation and adhesion, and these processes are followed by specialization and septation of hyphal compartments within the aggregates. Perithecial morphogenesis can be divided into the ascogonial, protoperithecial, and perithecial stages of development. At least 13 specialized, morphologically distinct cell-types are involved in perithecium morphogenesis, and these fall into three basic classes: hyphae, conglutinate cells and spores. Conglutinate cells arise from hyphal adhesion and certain perithecial hyphae develop from conglutinate cells. Various hypha-conglutinate cell transitions play important roles during the development of the perithecial wall and neck. 
<h3>21184840</h3>Functional analysis of the fungal/plant class chitinase family in <span class="yellow">Aspergillus fumigatus</span>. 

A quintuple mutant was constructed to delete the entire family of the fungal/plant (class III) chitinases of <span class="yellow">Aspergillus fumigatus</span>. Only a limited reduction in the total chitinolytic activity was seen for the different chitinase mutants including the quintuple mutant. In spite of this reduction in chitinolytic activity, no growth or germination defects were observed in these chitinase mutants. This result demonstrated that the fungal/plant chitinases do not have an essential role in the morphogenesis of <span class="yellow">A. fumigatus</span>. <span class="yellow">A</span> slight diminution of the growth during autolysis was seen for the quintuple mutant suggesting that class III chitinases may play only a nutritional role during this phase of the cycle, retarding <span class="red">fungal</span> death. 
<h3>21272794</h3>Emerging opportunistic <span class="yellow">yeast</span> infections.

A growing population of immunosuppressed patients has resulted in increasingly frequent diagnoses of invasive <span class="red">fungal</span> infections, including those caused by unusual <span class="yellow">yeasts</span>. The incidence of non-albicans species of Candida is increasing compared with that of <span class="yellow">Candida albicans</span>, and several species, such as <span class="yellow">Candida glabrata</span> and <span class="yellow">Candida krusei</span>, may be resistant to azole antifungal therapy. Trichosporon species are the second most common cause of fungaemia in patients with haematological malignant disease and are characterised by resistance to amphotericin and echinocandins and poor prognosis. Rhodotorula species belong to the family Cryptococcaceae, and are a cause of catheter-related fungaemia, sepsis, and invasive disease in severely immunosuppressed patients. An increasing number of sporadic cases of invasive <span class="red">fungal</span> infections by non-neoformans cryptococci have been reported in immunocompromised hosts, especially for patients with advanced <span class="yellow">HIV</span> infection or cancer who are undergoing transplant. Other uncommon <span class="yellow">yeasts</span> that can cause invasive disease in severely immunosuppressed patients include Geotrichum, Hansenula, Malassezia, and Saccharomyces. Host immune status is a crucial determinant of the type of invasive <span class="red">fungal</span> infection a patient is at risk for. Diagnosis can be challenging and relies heavily on traditional cultures of blood and other sterile sites, although serum (1,3)-Beta-D-glucan testing might have an adjunctive role. Although rare <span class="yellow">yeasts</span> are emerging as opportunistic <span class="yellow">human</span> pathogens, diagnosis remains challenging and treatment suboptimal. 
<h3>21320625</h3>Mechanisms of unisexual mating in <span class="yellow">Cryptococcus neoformans</span>.

Sex serves a pivotal role in genetic exchange and it contributes to the fitness and genetic diversity for eukaryotic populations. Although the importance of the canonical bisexual mating has been widely accepted, the significance of the evolution and maintenance of unisexual mating observed in some eukaryotes is unclear. The recent discovery of same-sex mating in the <span class="yellow">human</span> <span class="red">fungal</span> pathogen <span class="yellow">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> and the revelation of its impact on the Cryptococcus global population structure provide a platform to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and significance of unisexual mating. Here, we review the evidence of unisexual mating in Cryptococcus and provide some perspective on the biological significance of this life style on the survival of this important <span class="red">fungal</span> pathogen in the environment and in animal hosts. We also summarize our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing this unconventional mode of reproduction. 
<h3>21362493</h3>One step construction of Agrobacterium-Recombination-ready-plasmids (OSCAR), an efficient and robust tool for ATMT based gene deletion construction in fungi. 

Increasing availability of genomic data and sophistication of analytical methodology in fungi has elevated the need for functional genomics tools in these organisms. Previously we reported a method called DelsGate for rapid preparation of deletion constructs for protoplast-mediated <span class="red">fungal</span> transformation systems, which is based on Gateway(R) technology. However, over the past several years <span class="yellow">Agrobacteriumtumefaciens</span>-mediated transformation (ATMT) has become the preferred genetic transformation method for an increasing number of fungi. Therefore, we developed a method for One Step Construction of Agrobacterium-Recombination-ready-plasmids (OSCAR), to rapidly create deletion constructs for ATMT systems. The OSCAR methodology involves PCR amplification of the upstream and downstream flanks of the gene of interest, using gene specific primers each with a 5' extension containing one of four different attB recombination sites, modified from the Invitrogen MultiSite Gateway(R) system. Amplified gene flanks are then mixed with specifically designed marker and binary vectors and treated with BP clonase, generating the deletion construct in a single cloning step. The entire process of deletion construct preparation can be accomplished in just 2days. Using OSCAR we generated eight targeted deletion constructs and used two of them to generate deletion mutants in <span class="yellow">Verticillium dahliae</span> by ATMT. In summary, OSCAR methodology combines PCR and Gateway(R) technology to rapidly and robustly generate precise deletion constructs for <span class="red">fungal</span> ATMT and homologous gene replacement. 
<h3>21396477</h3><span class="yellow">Agrobacterium tumefasciens</span>-mediated transformation of the aquatic fungus <span class="yellow">Blastocladiella emersonii</span>. 

<span class="yellow">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span> is widely used for plant DNA transformation and more recently, has also been used to transform <span class="yellow">yeast</span>, filamentous fungi and even <span class="yellow">human</span> cells. Using this technique, we developed the first transformation protocol for the saprobic aquatic fungus <span class="yellow">Blastocladiella emersonii</span>, a Blastocladiomycete localized at the base of <span class="red">fungal</span> phylogenetic tree, which has been shown as a promising and interesting model of study of cellular function and differentiation. We constructed binary T-DNA vectors containing hygromycin phosphotransferase (hph) or enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) genes, under the control of <span class="yellow">Aspergillus nidulans</span> trpC promoter and terminator sequences. 24 h of co-cultivation in induction medium (IM) agar plates, followed by transfer to PYG-agar plates containing cefotaxim to kill <span class="yellow">Agrobacterium tumefsciens</span> and hygromycin to select transformants, resulted in growth and sporulation of resistant transformants. Genomic DNA from the pool o resistant zoospores were shown to contain T-DNA insertion as evidenced by PCR amplification of hph gene. Using a similar protocol we could also evidence the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in zoospores derived from transformed cells. This protocol can also open new perspectives for other non-transformable closely related fungi, like the Chytridiomycete class. 
<h3>21521145</h3>Occurrence of entomopathogenic fungi from agricultural and natural ecosystems in Saltillo, Mexico, and their virulence towards thrips and whiteflies. 

Entomopathogenic fungi were collected from soil in four adjacent habitats (oak forest, agricultural soil, pine reforestation and chaparral habitat) in Saltillo, Mexico using the insect bait method with <span class="yellow">Tenebrio molitor</span> (L.) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) larvae as bait. Overall, of the larvae exposed to soil, 171 (20%) hosted <span class="yellow">Beauveria bassiana</span> (Balsamo) Vuillemin (Hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae), 25 (3%) hosted <span class="yellow">Metarhizium anisopliae</span> (Metschnikoff) Sorokin (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae) and 1 (0.1%) hosted <span class="yellow">lsaria (=Paecilomyces) sp.</span> (Hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae). <span class="yellow">B. bassiana</span> was significantly more frequent on larvae exposed to oak forest soil. <span class="yellow">M. anisopliae</span> was significantly more frequent on larvae exposed to agricultural soil. From the infected bait insects, 93 isolates of <span class="yellow">B. bassiana</span> and 24 isolates of <span class="yellow">M. anisopliae</span> were obtained. Strains were tested for their infectivity against <span class="yellow">Cuban laurel thrips</span>, Gynaikothrips uzeli Zimmerman (Thysanoptera: Phlaeothripidae) and the <span class="yellow">greenhouse whitefly</span>, <span class="yellow">Trialeurodes vaporariorum</span> (Westwood) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae). <span class="yellow">B. bassiana</span> isolates caused the highest mortality on thrips (some causing 88% mortality after 6 days); both <span class="red">fungal</span> species caused similarly high mortality levels against whiteflies (75%) after 6 days. Large amounts of germplasm of entomopathogenic fungi, fundamentally <span class="yellow">B. bassiana</span> and <span class="yellow">M. anisopliae</span>, exist in the habitats sampled; pathogenicity varied among strains, and some strains possessed significant virulence. Soils in these habitats are reservoirs of diverse strains with potential for use in biocontrol. 
<h3>21807108</h3>Fluorescent protein fusions in <span class="yellow">Candida guilliermondii</span>. 

<span class="yellow">Candida guilliermondii</span> is an emerging <span class="red">fungal</span> agent of candidiasis often associated with oncology patients. This <span class="yellow">yeast</span> also remains a promising biotechnological model for the industrial production of value-added metabolites. In the present study, we developed a recipient strain as well as a set of plasmids for construction of fluorescent protein (FP) fusions in this species. We demonstrated that <span class="yellow">C. guilliermondii</span> phosphoglycerate kinase transcription-regulating sequences allow a constitutive expression of codon-optimized green, cyan, yellow and mCherry FP genes in <span class="yellow">C. guilliermondii</span> cells and the fluorescence signal could be directly observed at the colony and blastospore level by epifluorescence microcopy. To illustrate differential targeting of the FPs into specified cellular compartments, we studied and validated the expected subcellular localization of various <span class="yellow">C. guilliermondii</span> predicted proteins fused to FPs. Furthermore, co-expression experiments of various couples of FP-tagged <span class="yellow">C. guilliermondii</span> predicted proteins in the same cell showed that the fluorescence of each FP could be detected independently, providing firm evidences that YFP/CFP and GFP/mCherry pairs can be used for dual labeling in <span class="yellow">C. guilliermondii</span> cells. This technical advance will facilitate future studies of protein co-expression and co-localization in <span class="yellow">C. guilliermondii</span> and will give precious help for elucidating new molecular events supporting pathogenicity, antifungal resistance and for exploring the potential of <span class="yellow">yeast</span> metabolic engineering. 
<h3>21820070</h3>Application of the systematic "DAmP" approach to create a partially defective <span class="yellow">C. albicans</span> mutant. 

An understanding of gene function often relies upon creating multiple kinds of alleles. Functional analysis in <span class="yellow">Candida albicans</span>, a major <span class="red">fungal</span> pathogen, has generally included characterization of mutant strains with insertion or deletion alleles and over-expression alleles. Here we use in <span class="yellow">C. albicans</span> another type of allele that has been employed effectively in the model <span class="yellow">yeast</span> <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, a "Decreased Abundance by mRNA Perturbation" (DAmP) allele (Yan et al., 2008). DAmP alleles are created systematically through replacement of 30 noncoding regions with nonfunctional heterologous sequences, and thus are broadly applicable. We used a DAmP allele to probe the function of Sun41, a surface protein with roles in cell wall integrity, cell-cell adherence, hyphal formation, and biofilm formation that has been suggested as a possible therapeutic target (Firon et al., 2007; Hiller et al., 2007; Norice et al., 2007). <span class="yellow">A</span> SUN41-DAmP allele results in approximately 10-fold reduced levels of SUN41 RNA, and yields intermediate phenotypes in most assays. We report that a sun41Delta/Delta mutant is defective in biofilm formation in vivo, and that the SUN41-DAmP allele complements that defect. This finding argues that Sun41 may not be an ideal therapeutic target for biofilm inhibition, since a 90% decrease in activity has little effect on biofilm formation in vivo. We anticipate that DAmP alleles of <span class="yellow">C. albicans</span> genes will be informative for analysis of other prospective drug targets, including essential genes. 
<h3>21907298</h3><span class="yellow">Galleria mellonella</span> as model host for the trans-kingdom pathogen <span class="yellow">Fusarium oxysporum</span>. 

<span class="yellow">Fusarium oxysporum</span>, the causal agent of vascular wilt disease, affects a wide range of plant species and can produce disseminated infections in <span class="yellow">humans</span>. <span class="yellow">F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici isolate FGSC 9935</span> causes disease both on <span class="yellow">tomato plants</span> and immunodepressed <span class="yellow">mice</span>, making it an ideal model for the comparative analysis of <span class="red">fungal</span> virulence on plant and animal hosts. Here we tested the ability of <span class="yellow">FGSC 9935</span> to cause disease in the <span class="yellow">greater wax moth</span> <span class="yellow">Galleria mellonella</span>, an invertebrate model host that is widely used for the study of microbial <span class="yellow">human</span> pathogens. Injection of living but not of heat-killed microconidia into the hemocoel of <span class="yellow">G. mellonella</span> larvae resulted in dose-dependent killing both at 30^0C and at 37^0C. Fluorescence microscopy of larvae inoculated with a <span class="yellow">F. oxysporum transformant</span> expressing GFP revealed hyphal proliferation within the hemocoel, interaction with <span class="yellow">G. mellonella</span> hemocytes, and colonization of the killed insects by the fungus. Fungal gene knockout mutants previously tested in the <span class="yellow">tomato</span> and immunodepressed <span class="yellow">mouse</span> systems displayed a good correlation in virulence between the Galleria and the <span class="yellow">mouse</span> model. Thus, Galleria represents a useful non-vertebrate infection model for studying virulence mechanisms of <span class="yellow">F. oxysporum</span> on animal hosts. 
<h3>22056521</h3>Accumulation of P-bodies in <span class="yellow">Candida albicans</span> under different stress and filamentous growth conditions. 

<span class="yellow">Candida albicans</span> is an opportunistic <span class="red">fungal</span> pathogen that grows as budding <span class="yellow">yeast</span>, pseudohyphal, and hyphal forms. In response to external signals, <span class="yellow">C. albicans</span> switches rapidly among these forms. mRNA-containing cytoplasmic granules, termed processing bodies (P-bodies), have been reported to accumulate under various environmental stress conditions in diverse species from <span class="yellow">yeast</span> to mammals. Here, we provide the first microscopic and genetic characterization of P-bodies in <span class="yellow">C. albicans</span>. The core components of P-bodies, including the decapping machinery (Dcp2 and Dhh1), 5'-3' exoribonuclease (Kem1/Xrn1), and the P-body scaffolding protein (Edc3), were identified and their localizations with respect to P-bodies were demonstrated. Various growth conditions, including glucose deprivation, hyperosmotic stress, and heat stress, stimulated the accumulation of P-bodies. In addition, we observed P-body aggregation during hyphal development. The deletion mutant strain edc3/edc3 had a defect in filamentation and exhibited a dramatic reduction in the number of P-bodies. These results suggest that Edc3 plays an essential role in the assembly and maintenance of P-bodies in <span class="yellow">C. albicans</span>, and that the switch to filamentous growth appears to accompany P-body accumulation. 
<h3>22056522</h3>A heme peroxidase of the ascomyceteous lichen <span class="yellow">Leptogium saturninum</span> oxidizes high-redox potential substrates. 

Lichens belonging to the order Peltigerales display strong activity of multi-copper oxidases (e.g. tyrosinase) as well as heme-containing peroxidases. The lichen peroxidase was purified to homogeneity from the thallus of <span class="yellow">Leptogium saturninum</span> (LsaPOX) by fast protein liquid chromatography and then partially characterized. The oligomeric protein occurs as both 79kDa dimeric and 42kDa monomeric forms, and displayed broad substrate specificity. In addition to an ability to oxidize classic peroxidase substrates (e.g. 2,6-dimethoxyphenol), the enzyme could convert recalcitrant compounds such as synthetic dyes (e.g. Azure B and Reactive Blue 5), 4-nitrophenol and non-phenolic methoxylated aromatics (e.g. veratryl alcohol). Comparing LsaPOX with a basidiomycete dye-decolorizing (DyP)-type peroxidase from <span class="yellow">Auricularia auricula-judae</span> showed that the lichen enzyme has a high-redox potential, with oxidation capabilities ranging between those of known plant and <span class="red">fungal</span> peroxidases. Internal peptide fragments show homology (up to 60%) with putative proteins from free-living ascomycetes (e.g. <span class="yellow">Penicillium marneffei</span> and <span class="yellow">Neosartorya fischeri</span>), but not to sequences of algal or cyanobacterial peptides or to known <span class="red">fungal</span>, bacterial or plant peroxidases. LsaPOX is the first heme peroxidase purified from an ascomyceteous lichen that may help the organism to successfully exploit the extreme micro-environments in which they often grow. 
<h3>20817000</h3>Amino acid divergence between the CHS domain contributes to the different intracellular behaviour of Family II <span class="red">fungal</span> chitin synthases in <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>. 

Family II chitin synthases (CS), including classes IV and V enzymes, share conserved catalytic domains flanked by transmembrane regions. Here we addressed the characterization of Family II <span class="red">fungal</span> CSs by heterologous expression in <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>. Full-length CSs from classes V or IV were not functional when expressed in <span class="yellow">S. cerevisiae</span> and accumulated in different intracellular compartments. However, the exchange between different class IV, but not of class V, CHS domains resulted in functional proteins both in vivo and in vitro. The different domains afford the chimeric proteins distinct intracellular behaviours, ranging from endoplasmic reticulum retention to reduced endocytic turnover at the plasma membrane. These results allow a role in chitin synthesis to be assigned to all class IV enzymes, but they also highlight the involvement of the intracellular globular domain of these CSs, not only in enzymatic activity but also in the regulation of their intracellular turnover. 
<h3>20817114</h3>Activation of the heat shock transcription factor Hsf1 is essential for the full virulence of the <span class="red">fungal</span> pathogen <span class="yellow">Candida albicans</span>. 

The evolutionarily conserved heat shock transcription factor Hsf1 plays a central role in thermal adaptation in the major <span class="red">fungal</span> pathogen of <span class="yellow">humans</span>, <span class="yellow">Candida albicans</span>. Hsf1 becomes hyperphosphorylated in response to heat shock and activates the transcription of genes with heat shock elements (HSEs) in their promoters, these genes contributing to thermal adaptation. However, the relevance of Hsf1 activation to <span class="yellow">C. albicans</span> virulence is not clear as this pathogen is thought to be obligately associated with warm blooded animals, and this issue has not been tested because HSF1 is essential for viability in <span class="yellow">C. albicans</span>. In this study, we demonstrate that the HSE regulon is active in <span class="yellow">C. albicans</span> cells infecting the kidney. We also show the CE2 region of Hsf1 is required for activation and that the phosphorylation of specific residues in this domain contributes to Hsf1 activation. <span class="yellow">C. albicans</span> HSF1 mutants that lack this CE2 region are viable. However, they are unable to activate HSE-containing genes in response to heat shock, and they are thermosensitive. Using this HSF1 CE2 deletion mutant we demonstrate that Hsf1 activation, and hence thermal adaptation, contributes significantly to the virulence of <span class="yellow">C. albicans</span>. 
<h3>20880223</h3>Arbuscular mycorrhizal hyphopodia and germinated spore exudates trigger Ca2+ spiking in the legume and nonlegume root epidermis. 

* The aim of this study was to investigate Ca(2+) responses to endosymbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in the host root epidermis following pre-infection hyphopodium formation in both legumes and nonlegumes, and to determine to what extent these responses could be mimicked by germinated <span class="blue">fungal</span> spore exudate. * Root organ cultures of both <span class="yellow">Medicago truncatula</span> and <span class="yellow">Daucus carota</span>, expressing the nuclear-localized cameleon reporter NupYC2.1, were used to monitor AM-elicited Ca(2+) responses in host root tissues. * Ca(2+) spiking was observed in cells contacted by AM hyphopodia for both hosts, with highest frequencies correlating with the epidermal nucleus positioned facing the <span class="red">fungal</span> contact site. Treatment with AM spore exudate also elicited Ca(2+) spiking within the AM-responsive zone of the root and, in both cases, spiking was dependent on the <span class="yellow">M. truncatula</span> common SYM genes DMI1/2, but not on the rhizobial Nod factor perception gene NFP. * These findings support the conclusion that AM <span class="red">fungal</span> root penetration is preceded by a SYM pathway-dependent oscillatory Ca(2+) response, whose evolutionary origin predates the divergence between asterid and rosid clades. Our results further show that <span class="red">fungal</span> symbiotic signals are already generated during spore germination, and that cameleon-expressing root organ cultures represent a novel AM-specific bio-assay for such signals. 
<h3>20884368</h3>The <span class="yellow">Perigord black truffle</span> responds to cold temperature with an extensive reprogramming of its transcriptional activity. 

The <span class="yellow">Tuber melanosporum</span> genome has been analysed with the aim of identifying and characterizing the genes involved in the environmental stress response. <span class="yellow">A</span> whole genome array (7496 genes/probe) was used to verify the <span class="red">fungal</span> transcriptional profiling upon a cold temperature period (7 days at 4 ^0C). <span class="yellow">A</span> total of 423 genes resulted to be differentially expressed in a significant manner (>2.5-fold; p-value&lt;0.05) in the mycelia exposed to cold, compared to the control ones: 187 of these genes were up-regulated, while 236 were down-regulated. Sixty-six and fifty-one percent, respectively, of the up- or down-regulated transcripts had no KOG classification and were clustered as unclassified proteins, which was the most abundant category in the both up- and down-regulated genes. <span class="yellow">A</span> gene subset, containing a range of biological functions, was chosen to validate the microarray experiment through quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). The analysis confirmed the array data for 16 out of 22 of the considered genes, confirming that a cold temperature period influences the <span class="yellow">truffle</span> global gene expression. The expressed genes, which mostly resulted to be genes for heat shock proteins (HSPs) and genes involved in cell wall and lipid metabolism, could be involved in mechanisms, which are responsible for <span class="red">fungal</span> adaptation. Since <span class="yellow">truffle</span> ascomata develop during the winter period, we hypothesize that these differentially expressed genes may help the <span class="yellow">truffle</span> to adapt to low temperatures and/or perceive environmental signals that regulate the fructification. 
<h3>20958304</h3>Differentiating between effects of invasion and diversity: impacts of aboveground plant communities on belowground <span class="red">fungal</span> communities. 

Exotic plant species can affect soil microbial communities with the potential for community and ecosystem feedbacks. Yet, separating the effects of exotics from confounded changes in plant community diversity still remains a challenge. We focused on how plant diversity and native or exotic life history affected root fungi because of their significant roles in community and ecosystem processes. Specifically, we examined how fungi colonizing plant roots were affected by plant richness (one, two or four species) replicated across a range of plant community mixtures (natives, exotics, native-exotic mixtures). Fungal biomass inside roots was affected independently by plant richness and mixture, while root <span class="red">fungal</span> community composition was affected only by plant richness. Extraradical networks also increased in size with plant richness. By contrast, plant biomass was a function of plant mixture, with natives consistently smaller than exotics and native-exotic mixtures intermediate. Plant invasions may have an impact on the belowground community primarily through their effects on diversity, at least in the short-term. Disentangling the effects of diversity and invasion on belowground microbial communities can help us to understand both the controllers of belowground resilience and mechanisms of successful colonization and spread of exotic plants. 
<h3>21067947</h3>Characterizing the role of RNA silencing components in <span class="yellow">Cryptococcus neoformans</span>. 

The RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by homology-dependent degradation of the target mRNA with small RNA molecules plays a key role in controlling transcription and translation processes in a number of eukaryotic organisms. The RNAi machinery is also evolutionarily conserved in a wide variety of <span class="red">fungal</span> species, including pathogenic fungi. To elucidate the physiological functions of the RNAi pathway in <span class="yellow">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> that causes <span class="red">fungal</span> meningitis, here we performed genetic analyses for genes encoding Argonaute (AGO1 and AGO2), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDP1), and Dicers (DCR1 and DCR2) in both <span class="yellow">serotype A</span><span class="yellow">A</span> and D <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span>. The present study shows that Ago1, Rdp1, and Dcr2 are the major components of the RNAi process occurring in <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span>. However, the RNAi machinery is not involved in regulation of production of two virulence factors (capsule and melanin), sexual differentiation, and diverse stress response. Comparative transcriptome analysis of the <span class="yellow">serotype A</span><span class="yellow">A</span> and D RNAi mutants revealed that only modest changes occur in the genome-wide transcriptome profiles when the RNAi process was perturbed. Notably, the serotype D rdp1Delta mutants showed an increase in transcript abundance of active retrotransposons and transposons, such as T2 and T3, the latter of which is a novel serotype D-specific transposon of <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span>. In a wild type background both T2 and T3 were found to be weakly active mobile elements, although we found no evidence of Cnl1 retrotransposon mobility. In contrast, all three transposable elements exhibited enhanced mobility in the rdp1Delta mutant strain. In conclusion, the RNAi pathway plays an important role in controlling transposon activity and genome integrity of <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span>. 
<h3>21131495</h3>Complete genome sequence of <span class="yellow">Burkholderia rhizoxinica</span>, an Endosymbiont of <span class="yellow">Rhizopus microsporus</span>. 

<span class="yellow">Burkholderia rhizoxinica</span> is an intracellular symbiont of the phytopathogenic fungus <span class="yellow">Rhizopus microsporus</span>. The vertically transmitted endosymbiont not only delivers the antimitotic macrolide rhizoxin to its host but is also essential for vegetative spore formation of the fungus. To shed light on the genetic equipment of this model organism, we sequenced the whole genome of <span class="yellow">B. rhizoxinica HKI 0454</span>, thus providing the first genomic insight into an intracellular mutualist of a <span class="red">fungal</span> species. The 3.75-Mb genome consists of a chromosome and two strain-specific plasmids. The primary metabolism appears to be specialized for the uptake of <span class="red">fungal</span> metabolites. Besides the rhizoxin biosynthesis gene cluster, there are 14 loci coding for nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembly lines, which represent novel targets for genomic mining of cryptic natural products. Furthermore, the endosymbionts are equipped with a repertoire of virulence-related factors, which can now be studied to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying bacterial-fungal interaction. 
<h3>21145410</h3>Sequenced dermatophyte strains: growth rate, conidiation, drug susceptibilities, and virulence in an invertebrate model. 

Although dermatophytes are the most common cause of <span class="red">fungal</span> infections in the world, their basic biology is not well understood. The recent sequencing and annotation of the genomes of five representative dermatophyte species allows for the creation of hypotheses as to how they cause disease and have adapted to their distinct environments. An understanding of the microbiology of these strains will be essential for testing these hypotheses. This study is the first to generally characterize these five sequenced strains of dermatophytes for their microbiological aspects. We measured the growth rate on solid medium and found differences between species, with <span class="yellow">Microsporum gypseum</span> CBS118893 having the fastest growth and <span class="yellow">Trichophyton rubrum</span> CBS118892 the slowest. We also compared different media for conidia production and found that the highest numbers of conidia were produced when dermatophytes were grown on MAT agar. We determined the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of nine antifungal agents and confirmed susceptibility to antifungals commonly used as selectable markers. Finally, we tested virulence in the <span class="yellow">Galleria mellonella</span> (<span class="yellow">wax moth</span>) larvae model but found the results variable. These results increase our understanding of the microbiology and molecular biology of these dermatophyte strains and will be of use in advancing hypothesis-driven research about dermatophytes. 
<h3>21176788</h3>Hyphal and cytoskeleton polarization in <span class="yellow">Tuber melanosporum</span>: a genomic and cellular analysis. 

Filamentous polarized growth involves a series of events including polarization of the cytoskeleton to selected growth sites, and the transport of secretory vesicles containing the components required for growth. The availability of <span class="red">fungal</span> genome sequences has recently led to the identification of a large number of proteins involved in these processes. We have explored the <span class="yellow">Tuber melanosporum</span> genome sequence by searching for homologs of genes known to play crucial roles in the morphogenesis and cell polarity of <span class="yellow">yeasts</span> and filamentous fungi. One hundred and forty-nine genes have been identified and functionally grouped according to the deduced amino acid sequences (44 genes involved in cell polarity/morphogenesis, 39 belonging to the actin cytoskeleton and 66 involved in membrane dynamics, septation and exocytosis). <span class="yellow">A</span> detailed gene annotation has shown that most components of the cell polarity machinery, morphogenesis and cytoskeleton found in <span class="yellow">yeasts</span> and filamentous fungi are conserved, although the degree of similarity varies from strong to weak. Microscopic analysis of quick-frozen <span class="yellow">truffle</span> hyphae detected the characteristic subcellular components of the hyphal tip in septate filamentous fungi, while transcript profiles revealed a moderately variable pattern during the biological cycle. 
<h3>21220038</h3>acon-3, the <span class="yellow">Neurospora crassa</span> ortholog of the developmental modifier, medA, complements the conidiation defect of the <span class="yellow">Aspergillus nidulans</span> mutant. 

<span class="yellow">Aspergillus nidulans</span> and <span class="yellow">Neurospora crassa</span> are ascomycetes that produce asexual spores through morphologically distinct processes. MedA, a protein with unknown function, is required for normal asexual and sexual development in <span class="yellow">A. nidulans</span>. We determined that the <span class="yellow">N. crassa</span> ortholog of medA is acon-3, a gene required for early conidiophore development and female fertility. To test hypotheses about the evolutionary origins of asexual development in distinct <span class="red">fungal</span> lineages it is important to understand the degree of conservation of developmental regulators. The amino acid sequences of <span class="yellow">A. nidulans</span> MedA and <span class="yellow">N. crassa</span> ACON-3 shared 37% identity and 51% similarity. acon-3 is induced at late time points of conidiation. In contrast, medA is constitutively expressed and MedA protein localizes to nuclei in all tissue types. Nonetheless, expression of acon-3 using its native promoter complemented the conidiation defects of the <span class="yellow">A. nidulans</span> DeltamedA and medA15 mutants. We conclude that the biochemical activity of the medA orthologs is conserved for conidiation. 
<h3>21397712</h3>Npc1 is involved in sterol trafficking in the filamentous fungus <span class="yellow">Fusarium graminearum</span>. 

The ortholog of the <span class="yellow">human</span> gene NPC1 was identified in the plant pathogenic, filamentous fungus <span class="yellow">Fusarium graminearum</span> by shared amino acid sequence, protein domain structure and cellular localization of the mature <span class="red">fungal</span> protein. The FusariumNpc1 gene shares 34% amino acid sequence identity and 51% similarity to the <span class="yellow">human</span> gene, has similar domain structure and is constitutively expressed, although up-regulated in ungerminated macroconidia and ascospores. GFP-tagged Npc1p localizes to the <span class="red">fungal</span> vacuolar membrane. Cultures derived from a Deltanpc1 mutant strain contain significantly more ergosterol than cultures of the wildtype. Staining with the fluorescent, sterol binding dye filipin, shows that ergosterol accumulates in vacuoles of the Deltanpc1 mutant but not the wildtype strain. The Deltanpc1 mutant has a temperature dependent reduction in growth and greater sensitivity to the ergosterol synthesis inhibiting fungicide tebuconazole compared with the wildtype strain or the mutant complemented with wildtype Npc1. The mutant also is significantly reduced in pathogenicity to <span class="yellow">wheat</span>. Our results are consistent with the interpretation that Npc1p is important for normal transport of ergosterol from the vacuole and is essential for proper membrane function under particular environmental conditions. 
<h3>22182609</h3>Infection by Mycorrhizal Fungi Increases Natural Enemy Abundance on Tobacco (<span class="yellow">Nicotiana rustica</span>). 

The presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) influences plant nutrient uptake, growth, and plant defensive chemistry, thereby directly influencing multi-trophic interactions. Different <span class="red">fungal</span> isolates (genotypes of the same <span class="red">fungal</span> species) have been shown to differ in nutrient uptake ability. Plants infected with different AMF genotypes may vary in foliar nutrient or defensive chemical levels, potentially influencing multi-trophic interactions. Using a completely randomized design, we compared the effect of two isolates of the mycorrhizal fungus <span class="yellow">Glomus etunicatum</span> W. N. Becker &amp; Gerdemann on <span class="yellow">silver leaf whitefly</span> (<span class="yellow">Bemisia argentifolii</span> Bellows &amp; Perring) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) and parasitic <span class="yellow">wasp</span> (<span class="yellow">Eretmocerus eremicus</span> Rose &amp; Zolnerowich) (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) abundance. Whitefly populations were not influenced by AMF infection. Parasite populations were higher on plants infected with the isolate collected from Georgia, even after controlling for whitefly abundance and plant architecture. We propose that AMF indirectly influences parasite abundance and parasitism through a change in leaf surface chemicals that affect parasitic wasps. Because of the ubiquity of and genetic variation in AMF, multi-trophic interactions are likely to be strongly influenced by belowground processes. 
<h3>20601041</h3>Surveys of non-ribosomal peptide and polyketide assembly lines in fungi and prospects for their analysis in vitro and in vivo. 

With many bioactive non-ribosomal peptides and polyketides produced in fungi, studies of their biosyntheses are an active area of research. Practical limitations of working with mega-dalton synthetases including cell lysis and protein extraction to recombinant gene and pathway expression has slowed understanding of many secondary metabolic processes relative to bacterial counterparts. Recent advances in accessing <span class="red">fungal</span> biosynthetic machinery are beginning to change this. Here we describe the successes of some studies of thiotemplate biosynthesis in <span class="red">fungal</span> systems, along with very recent advances in chemical tagging and mass spectrometric strategies to selectively study biosynthetic conveyer belts in isolation, and within a few years, in endogenous <span class="red">fungal</span> proteomes. 
<h3>20946589</h3>Cryptogein, a <span class="red">fungal</span> elicitor, remodels the phenylpropanoid metabolism of <span class="yellow">tobacco</span> cell suspension cultures in a calcium-dependent manner. 

Plant cells use calcium-based signalling pathways to transduce biotic and/or abiotic stimuli into adaptive responses. However, little is known about the coupling between calcium signalling, transcriptional regulation and the downstream biochemical processes. To understand these relationships better, we challenged <span class="yellow">tobacco</span> BY-2 cells with cryptogein and evaluated how calcium transients (monitored through the calcium sensor aequorin) impact (1) transcript levels of phenylpropanoid genes (assessed by RT-qPCR); and (2) derived-phenolic compounds (analysed by mass spectrometry). Most genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway were up-regulated by cryptogein and cell wall-bound phenolic compounds accumulated (mainly 5-hydroxyferulic acid). The accumulation of both transcripts and phenolics was calcium-dependent. The transcriptional regulation of phenylpropanoid genes was correlated in a non-linear manner with stimulus intensity and with components of the cryptogein-induced calcium signature. In addition, calmodulin inhibitors increased the sensitivity of cells to low concentrations of cryptogein. These results led us to propose a model of coupling between the cryptogein signal, calcium signalling and the transcriptional response, exerting control of transcription through the coordinated action of two decoding modules exerting opposite effects. 
<h3>20964694</h3>The degree of mycoheterotrophic carbon gain in green, variegated and vegetative albino individuals of <span class="yellow">Cephalanthera damasonium</span> is related to leaf chlorophyll concentrations. 

* Achlorophyllous variants of some forest orchids are known to reach almost the same size as their green forms. These vegetative albino forms cover their entire carbon (C) demand through fungi that simultaneously form ectomycorrhizae with trees, while green variants partially draw on C from photosynthesis and C from <span class="red">fungal</span> hosts. Here, we investigate whether the amount of C derived from either source is proportional to leaf chlorophyll concentration. The discovery of two <span class="yellow">Cephalanthera damasonium</span> populations with variegated leaves enabled a continuous bridging of leaf chlorophyll concentrations between green and albino forms. * Leaves of 27 green, variegated and albino individuals of <span class="yellow">C. damasonium</span> were compared for chlorophyll concentrations, C sources (as characterized by (13)C abundances) and total C and nitrogen (N) concentrations. * We found a linear relationship between leaf chlorophyll concentrations and the proportional reliance on fungi as a C source. Furthermore, we show that the shift in C gain through mycoheterotrophic means significantly changes leaf total C and N concentrations. * Our results document that partial mycoheterotrophy in <span class="yellow">C. damasonium</span> is not a static nutritional mode but a flexible mechanism related inter alia to leaf chlorophyll concentrations. The change in proportional reliance on fungi as a C source affects leaf chemical composition. 
<h3>21241815</h3>Genetic and molecular characterization of a blue light photoreceptor MGWC-1 in <span class="yellow">Magnaporth oryzae</span>. 

Three key factors involved in successful plant disease development include the presence of a susceptible host, a virulent pathogen, and a disease-conducive environment. Our understanding of how environmental factors influence disease-conducive or disease-suppressive conditions, and how a pathogen advantageously capitalizes on them, is quite limited. Utilizing the model pathosystem <span class="yellow">Magnaporthe oryzae</span>-<span class="yellow">Oryza sativa</span>, we found a significant light-dependent disease suppression. Our genetic data suggest that the blue-light receptor MGWC-1 in <span class="yellow">M. oryzae</span> is involved in light-dependent disease suppression during the dark-phase (disease-conducive light condition) immediately after pathogen-host contact. Sensing &quot;darkness&quot; is accomplished by MGWC-1, a blue-light receptor in <span class="yellow">M. oryzae</span>. To explore the potential molecular mechanisms of light-dependent disease suppression we performed a genome-wide microarray experiment and identified several groups of gene families that are differentially regulated during the light-to-dark transition. Our genetic and molecular data provide insights into how a <span class="red">fungal</span> pathogen utilizes ambient light signals for successful disease development. 
<h3>21406243</h3>Potassium and sodium uptake systems in fungi. The transporter diversity of <span class="yellow">Magnaporthe oryzae</span>. 

In this study, we report an inventory of the K(+) uptake systems in 62 <span class="red">fungal</span> species for which the complete genome sequences are available. This inventory reveals that three types of K(+) uptake systems, TRK and HAK transporters and ACU ATPases, are widely present in several combinations across <span class="red">fungal</span> species. PAT ATPases are less frequently present and are exceptional in Ascomycota. The genome of <span class="yellow">Magnaporthe oryzae</span> contains four TRK, one HAK, and two ACU genes. The study of the expression of these genes at high K(+), K(+) starvation, and in infected <span class="yellow">rice</span> leaves revealed that the expression of four genes, ACU1, ACU2, HAK1, and TRK1 is much lower than that of TRK2, TRK3, and TRK4, except under K(+) starvation. The two ACU ATPases were cloned and functionally identified as high-affinity K(+) or Na(+) uptake systems. These two ATPases endow <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> with the capacity to grow for several generations in low Na(+) concentrations when K(+) was absent, which produces a dramatic increase of cellular Na(+)/K(+) ratio. 
<h3>21907817</h3>GintAMT2, a new member of the ammonium transporter family in the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus <span class="yellow">Glomus intraradices</span>. 

In the symbiotic association of plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, the fungus delivers mineral nutrients, such as phosphate and nitrogen, to the plant while receiving carbon. Previously, we identified an NH(4)(+) transporter in the AM fungus <span class="yellow">Glomus intraradices</span> (GintAMT1) involved in NH(4)(+) uptake from the soil when preset at low concentrations. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a new <span class="yellow">G. intraradicesNH(4)</span>(+) transporter gene (GintAMT2). <span class="yellow">Yeast</span> mutant complementation assays showed that GintAMT2 encodes a functional NH(4)(+) transporter. The use of an anti-GintAMT2 polyclonal antibody revealed a plasma membrane location of GintAMT2. GintAMT1 and GintAMT2 were differentially expressed during the <span class="red">fungal</span> life cycle and in response to N. In contrast to GintAMT1, GintAMT2 transcript levels were higher in the intraradical than in the extraradical <span class="red">fungal</span> structures. However, transcripts of both genes were detected in arbuscule-colonized cortical cells. GintAMT1 expression was induced under low N conditions. Constitutive expression of GintAMT2 in N-limiting conditions and transitory induction after N re-supply suggests a role for GintAMT2 to retrieve NH(4)(+) leaked out during <span class="red">fungal</span> metabolism. 
<h3>22001288</h3>Modulation of <span class="red">fungal</span> sensitivity to staurosporine by targeting proteins identified by transcriptional profiling. 

An analysis of the time-dependent genetic response to the death-inducer staurosporine was performed in <span class="yellow">Neurospora crassa</span> by transcriptional profiling. Staurosporine induced two major genes encoding an ABC transporter and a protein with similarity to regulatory subunits of potassium channels. The transcriptional response is dependent on the activity of a novel transcription factor. Deletion mutants in differentially expressed genes displayed altered sensitivity to staurosporine, underscoring significant proteins involved in the response to the drug. <span class="yellow">A</span> null-mutant of the ABC transporter (abc3) is extremely sensitive to staurosporine, accumulates more staurosporine than the wild type strain and is defective in energy-dependent export of the drug, indicating that the ABC3 protein is the first described staurosporine transporter. It was located in the plasma membrane by immunofluorescence microscopy. The combination of inhibitors of ABC transporters or of potassium channels with staurosporine leads to an enhanced activity against <span class="yellow">N. crassa</span> and pathogenic fungi paving the way to the development of more potent and specific antifungals. Our results highlight the general use of transcriptional profiling for the identification of novel proteins involved in cell death and their potential use as drug targets. 
<h3>22182612</h3>Comparative Impact of Artificial Selection for Fungicide Resistance on <span class="yellow">Beauveria bassiana</span> and <span class="yellow">Metarhizium brunneum</span>. 

Hypocreales fungi such as <span class="yellow">Beauveria bassiana</span> (Balsamo) Vuillemin and <span class="yellow">Metarhizium brunneum</span> Petch can be negatively affected by fungicides thereby reducing their biocontrol potential. In a previous study, we demonstrated enhanced fungicide resistance in <span class="yellow">B. bassiana</span> through artificial selection. However, it is not clear if the enhanced resistance was because of improved germination, vegetative growth, or both. Additionally, the enhanced fungicide resistance has only been demonstrated in <span class="yellow">B. bassiana</span>, and therefore it is of interest to investigate the potential to enhance resistance in other fungi. Thus, the objectives in this study were to determine the potential to enhance fungicide resistance in <span class="yellow">M. brunneum</span> through artificial selection, and investigate if selection is based on germination, vegetative growth, or both in <span class="yellow">B. bassiana</span> and <span class="yellow">M. brunneum</span>. Selection for resistance to fenbuconazole, and triphenyltin hydroxide was assessed through inhibition evaluations on solid media, and germination and mycelial growth in liquid media. Increased resistance after selection was observed for all fungicide-fungus combinations on solid and or liquid media. Selection resulted in increased resistance to fenbuconazole in both fungi in solid and liquid media; in liquid culture fungicide resistance in <span class="yellow">B. bassiana</span> was manifested by increased germination and mycelial growth, whereas in <span class="yellow">M. brunneum</span> fungicide resistance concerned only mycelial growth. Selection for resistance to triphenyltin hydroxide varied in the different media. For <span class="yellow">B. bassiana</span>, triphenyltin hydroxide resistance was enhanced on solid media but not in liquid, whereas enhanced resistance of <span class="yellow">M. brunneum</span> was detected in both media. Fungicide sensitivity and selection potential differs based on the medium and <span class="red">fungal</span> species. Selection for fungicide resistance, had negative effects on other beneficial traits when fungicide pressure was removed, for example, some selected populations showed decreased germination or growth, relative to their nonselected control populations. Additionally, reduced virulence to the <span class="yellow">greater wax moth</span>, <span class="yellow">Galleria mellonella</span> (L.), was observed in all <span class="red">fungal</span> populations that were exposed to fungicide resistance regimes. We conclude that it is possible to use genetic selection to enhance fungicide resistance in <span class="yellow">B. bassiana</span> and <span class="yellow">M. brunneum</span>, but before use the resulting populations should be screened for inadvertent negative impacts on beneficial traits.
