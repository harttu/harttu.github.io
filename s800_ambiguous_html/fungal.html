</br>
The increasing number of <b>fungal</b> genome sequences impressively demonstrated that their biosynthetic potential is far from being exploited . 
</br>
The lipid language of plant - <b>fungal</b> interactions . 
</br>
Lipid mediated cross - kingdom communication between hosts and pathogens is a rapidly emerging field in molecular plant - <b>fungal</b> interactions . 
</br>
Amidst our growing understanding of <b>fungal</b> and plant chemical cross - talk lies the distinct , yet little studied , role for a group of oxygenated lipids derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids , termed oxylipins . 
</br>
Endogenous <b>fungal</b> oxylipins are known for their roles in carrying out pathogenic strategies to successfully colonize their host , reproduce , and synthesize toxins . 
</br>
Here we review the composition and endogenous functions of oxylipins produced by both plants and fungi and introduce evidence which suggests that <b>fungal</b> pathogens exploit host oxylipins to facilitate their own virulence and pathogenic development . 
</br>
Recent studies in several <b>fungal</b> species have identified a chromatin - based regulation of secondary metabolism ( SM ) gene clusters representing an upper - hierarchical level for the coordinated control of large chromosomal elements . 
</br>
Since the PRP8 intein is located in a functionally essential nuclear protein , it can be considered a promising therapeutic target for anti - <b>fungal</b> drugs , because inhibition of intein splicing should inhibit proliferation of intein - containing pathogens . 
</br>
In this review , we focus on the role of secondary metabolism in driving antagonistic arthropod - fungus interactions , i . e . , where fungi serve as a food source to <b>fungal</b> grazers , compete with saprophagous insects , and attack insects as hosts for growth and reproduction . 
</br>
Light can also affect <b>fungal</b> metabolism , including the biosynthesis of natural products . 
</br>
Glucose abundance also affected the light - dependent subcellular localization of the VeA ( velvet ) protein , a key regulator necessary for normal light - dependent morphogenesis and secondary metabolism in Aspergilli and other <b>fungal</b> genera . 
</br>
Although <b>fungal</b> growth was not directly affected by temperature , we found that AMF isolates originating from contrasting climates consistently and differentially altered plant growth . 
</br>
We analysed the N % and abundance of the stable isotope ( 15 ) N in tree needles and soil , soil microbial fatty acid biomarkers and <b>fungal</b> DNA . 
</br>
This decrease , and the larger contributions compared with N - loaded plots of a <b>fungal</b> fatty acid biomarker and ectomycorrhizal sequences , suggest recovery of ectomycorrhiza . 
</br>
SB__Fusarium SI__verticillioides is one of the most important <b>fungal</b> pathogens to cause destructive diseases of SB__maize worldwide . 
</br>
The two <b>fungal</b> pathogens SB__Blumeria SI__graminis SI__f SI__. SI__sp SI__. SI__tritici ( SB__B SI__. SI__g SI__. SI__tritici ) and SB__hordei ( SB__B SI__. SI__g SI__. SI__hordei ) cause powdery mildew specifically in SB__wheat or SB__barley . 
</br>
These analyses provided definitive evidence that SB__T SI__. SI__melanosporum is a heterothallic species with a MAT locus that is organized similarly to those of ancient <b>fungal</b> lineages . 
</br>
In this study , we surveyed the SB__T SI__. SI__melanosporum genome ( 1 ) to characterise its SSR pattern ; ( 2 ) to compare it with SSR patterns found in 48 other <b>fungal</b> and three oomycetes genomes and ( 3 ) to identify new polymorphic SSR markers for population genetics . 
</br>
This organism is well known for stimulating plant growth and biosynthesizing complex small molecules that suppress the growth of bacterial and <b>fungal</b> plant pathogens . 
</br>
FungiFun : a web - based application for functional categorization of <b>fungal</b> genes and proteins . 
</br>
FungiFun assigns functional annotations to <b>fungal</b> genes or proteins and performs gene set enrichment analysis . 
</br>
Based on three different classification methods ( FunCat , GO and KEGG ) , FungiFun categorizes genes and proteins for several <b>fungal</b> species on different levels of annotation detail . 
</br>
Moreover , Um Rco1 represents a subfamily of <b>fungal</b> enzymes likely involved in the degradation of stilbene compounds , as suggested by the cleavage of resveratrol by homologs from SB__Aspergillus SI__fumigatus , SB__Chaetomium SI__globosum and SB__Botryotinia SI__fuckeliana . 
</br>
Metal transporters , especially those related to Cu and Zn trafficking , displayed the highest expression levels in mycorrhizae , suggesting extensive translocation of both metals to root cells as well as to <b>fungal</b> metalloenzymes ( e . g . , laccase ) that are strongly upregulated in symbiotic hyphae . 
</br>
The perithecium of the self - fertile ascomycete SB__Sordaria SI__macrospora provides an excellent model in which to analyse <b>fungal</b> multicellular development . 
</br>
Functional analysis of the <b>fungal</b> / plant class chitinase family in SB__Aspergillus SI__fumigatus . 
</br>
A quintuple mutant was constructed to delete the entire family of the <b>fungal</b> / plant ( class III ) chitinases of SB__Aspergillus SI__fumigatus . 
</br>
This result demonstrated that the <b>fungal</b> / plant chitinases do not have an essential role in the morphogenesis of SB__A SI__. SI__fumigatus . 
</br>
A slight diminution of the growth during autolysis was seen for the quintuple mutant suggesting that class III chitinases may play only a nutritional role during this phase of the cycle , retarding <b>fungal</b> death . 
</br>
A growing population of immunosuppressed patients has resulted in increasingly frequent diagnoses of invasive <b>fungal</b> infections , including those caused by unusual yeasts . 
</br>
An increasing number of sporadic cases of invasive <b>fungal</b> infections by non - neoformans cryptococci have been reported in immunocompromised hosts , especially for patients with advanced SB__HIV infection or cancer who are undergoing transplant . 
</br>
Host immune status is a crucial determinant of the type of invasive <b>fungal</b> infection a patient is at risk for . 
</br>
The recent discovery of same - sex mating in the SB__human <b>fungal</b> pathogen SB__Cryptococcus SI__neoformans and the revelation of its impact on the Cryptococcus global population structure provide a platform to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and significance of unisexual mating . 
</br>
Here , we review the evidence of unisexual mating in Cryptococcus and provide some perspective on the biological significance of this life style on the survival of this important <b>fungal</b> pathogen in the environment and in animal hosts . 
</br>
Previously we reported a method called DelsGate for rapid preparation of deletion constructs for protoplast - mediated <b>fungal</b> transformation systems , which is based on Gateway ( R ) technology . 
</br>
In summary , OSCAR methodology combines PCR and Gateway ( R ) technology to rapidly and robustly generate precise deletion constructs for <b>fungal</b> ATMT and homologous gene replacement . 
</br>
Using this technique , we developed the first transformation protocol for the saprobic aquatic fungus SB__Blastocladiella SI__emersonii , a Blastocladiomycete localized at the base of <b>fungal</b> phylogenetic tree , which has been shown as a promising and interesting model of study of cellular function and differentiation . 
</br>
SB__B SI__. SI__bassiana isolates caused the highest mortality on thrips ( some causing 88 % mortality after 6 days ) ; both <b>fungal</b> species caused similarly high mortality levels against whiteflies ( 75 % ) after 6 days . 
</br>
SB__Candida SI__guilliermondii is an emerging <b>fungal</b> agent of candidiasis often associated with oncology patients . 
</br>
Functional analysis in SB__Candida SI__albicans , a major <b>fungal</b> pathogen , has generally included characterization of mutant strains with insertion or deletion alleles and over - expression alleles . 
</br>
SB__F SI__. SI__oxysporum SI__f SI__. SI__sp SI__. SI__lycopersici SI__isolate SI__FGSC SI__9935 causes disease both on SB__tomato SI__plants and immunodepressed SB__mice , making it an ideal model for the comparative analysis of <b>fungal</b> virulence on plant and animal hosts . 
</br>
SB__Candida SI__albicans is an opportunistic <b>fungal</b> pathogen that grows as budding yeast , pseudohyphal , and hyphal forms . 
</br>
Comparing LsaPOX with a basidiomycete dye - decolorizing ( DyP ) - type peroxidase from SB__Auricularia SI__auricula SI__- SI__judae showed that the lichen enzyme has a high - redox potential , with oxidation capabilities ranging between those of known plant and <b>fungal</b> peroxidases . 
</br>
Internal peptide fragments show homology ( up to 60 % ) with putative proteins from free - living ascomycetes ( e . g . SB__Penicillium SI__marneffei and SB__Neosartorya SI__fischeri ) , but not to sequences of algal or cyanobacterial peptides or to known <b>fungal</b> , bacterial or plant peroxidases . 
</br>
Recent advances in accessing <b>fungal</b> biosynthetic machinery are beginning to change this . 
</br>
Here we describe the successes of some studies of thiotemplate biosynthesis in <b>fungal</b> systems , along with very recent advances in chemical tagging and mass spectrometric strategies to selectively study biosynthetic conveyer belts in isolation , and within a few years , in endogenous <b>fungal</b> proteomes . 
</br>
Recent evidence of this trend is an outbreak of Cytospora canker disease ( <b>fungal</b> pathogen Valsa melanodiscus ( anamorph = Cytospora umbrina ) ) on Alnus species . 
</br>
Cryptogein , a <b>fungal</b> elicitor , remodels the phenylpropanoid metabolism of SB__tobacco cell suspension cultures in a calcium - dependent manner . 
</br>
These vegetative albino forms cover their entire carbon ( C ) demand through fungi that simultaneously form ectomycorrhizae with trees , while green variants partially draw on C from photosynthesis and C from <b>fungal</b> hosts . 
</br>
Our genetic and molecular data provide insights into how a <b>fungal</b> pathogen utilizes ambient light signals for successful disease development . 
</br>
In this study , we report an inventory of the K ( + ) uptake systems in 62 <b>fungal</b> species for which the complete genome sequences are available . 
</br>
This inventory reveals that three types of K ( + ) uptake systems , TRK and HAK transporters and ACU ATPases , are widely present in several combinations across <b>fungal</b> species . 
</br>
GintAMT1 and GintAMT2 were differentially expressed during the <b>fungal</b> life cycle and in response to N . 
</br>
In contrast to GintAMT1 , GintAMT2 transcript levels were higher in the intraradical than in the extraradical <b>fungal</b> structures . 
</br>
Constitutive expression of GintAMT2 in N - limiting conditions and transitory induction after N re - supply suggests a role for GintAMT2 to retrieve NH ( 4 ) ( + ) leaked out during <b>fungal</b> metabolism . 
</br>
Modulation of <b>fungal</b> sensitivity to staurosporine by targeting proteins identified by transcriptional profiling . 
</br>
Fungicide sensitivity and selection potential differs based on the medium and <b>fungal</b> species . 
</br>
Additionally , reduced virulence to the SB__greater SI__wax SI__moth , SB__Galleria SI__mellonella ( L . ) , was observed in all <b>fungal</b> populations that were exposed to fungicide resistance regimes .

</br>
Amino acid divergence between the CHS domain contributes to the different intracellular behaviour of Family II <b>fungal</b> chitin synthases in SB__Saccharomyces SI__cerevisiae . 
</br>
Here we addressed the characterization of Family II <b>fungal</b> CSs by heterologous expression in SB__Saccharomyces SI__cerevisiae . 
</br>
Activation of the heat shock transcription factor Hsf1 is essential for the full virulence of the <b>fungal</b> pathogen SB__Candida SI__albicans . 
</br>
The evolutionarily conserved heat shock transcription factor Hsf1 plays a central role in thermal adaptation in the major <b>fungal</b> pathogen of SB__humans , SB__Candida SI__albicans . 
</br>
* Ca ( 2 + ) spiking was observed in cells contacted by AM hyphopodia for both hosts , with highest frequencies correlating with the epidermal nucleus positioned facing the <b>fungal</b> contact site . 
</br>
* These findings support the conclusion that AM <b>fungal</b> root penetration is preceded by a SYM pathway - dependent oscillatory Ca ( 2 + ) response , whose evolutionary origin predates the divergence between asterid and rosid clades . 
</br>
Our results further show that <b>fungal</b> symbiotic signals are already generated during spore germination , and that cameleon - expressing root organ cultures represent a novel AM - specific bio - assay for such signals . 
</br>
A whole genome array ( 7496 genes / probe ) was used to verify the <b>fungal</b> transcriptional profiling upon a cold temperature period ( 7 days at 4 ^ 0C ) . 
</br>
The expressed genes , which mostly resulted to be genes for heat shock proteins ( HSPs ) and genes involved in cell wall and lipid metabolism , could be involved in mechanisms , which are responsible for <b>fungal</b> adaptation . 
</br>
Differentiating between effects of invasion and diversity : impacts of aboveground plant communities on belowground <b>fungal</b> communities . 
</br>
Fungal biomass inside roots was affected independently by plant richness and mixture , while root <b>fungal</b> community composition was affected only by plant richness . 
</br>
The RNAi machinery is also evolutionarily conserved in a wide variety of <b>fungal</b> species , including pathogenic fungi . 
</br>
To elucidate the physiological functions of the RNAi pathway in SB__Cryptococcus SI__neoformans that causes <b>fungal</b> meningitis , here we performed genetic analyses for genes encoding Argonaute ( AGO1 and AGO2 ) , RNA - dependent RNA polymerase ( RDP1 ) , and Dicers ( DCR1 and DCR2 ) in both serotype A and D SB__C SI__. SI__neoformans . 
</br>
To shed light on the genetic equipment of this model organism , we sequenced the whole genome of SB__B SI__. SI__rhizoxinica SI__HKI SI__0454 , thus providing the first genomic insight into an intracellular mutualist of a <b>fungal</b> species . 
</br>
The primary metabolism appears to be specialized for the uptake of <b>fungal</b> metabolites . 
</br>
Furthermore , the endosymbionts are equipped with a repertoire of virulence - related factors , which can now be studied to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying bacterial - <b>fungal</b> interaction . 
</br>
Although dermatophytes are the most common cause of <b>fungal</b> infections in the world , their basic biology is not well understood . 
</br>
The availability of <b>fungal</b> genome sequences has recently led to the identification of a large number of proteins involved in these processes . 
</br>
To test hypotheses about the evolutionary origins of asexual development in distinct <b>fungal</b> lineages it is important to understand the degree of conservation of developmental regulators . 
</br>
The ortholog of the SB__human gene NPC1 was identified in the plant pathogenic , filamentous fungus SB__Fusarium SI__graminearum by shared amino acid sequence , protein domain structure and cellular localization of the mature <b>fungal</b> protein . 
</br>
GFP - tagged Npc1p localizes to the <b>fungal</b> vacuolar membrane . 
</br>
Different <b>fungal</b> isolates ( genotypes of the same <b>fungal</b> species ) have been shown to differ in nutrient uptake ability . 
</br>
Recent advances in accessing <b>fungal</b> biosynthetic machinery are beginning to change this . 
</br>
Here we describe the successes of some studies of thiotemplate biosynthesis in <b>fungal</b> systems , along with very recent advances in chemical tagging and mass spectrometric strategies to selectively study biosynthetic conveyer belts in isolation , and within a few years , in endogenous <b>fungal</b> proteomes . 
</br>
