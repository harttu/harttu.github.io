<h2>Pseudomonas fluorescens Q8r1-96</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20971913</h3>Structural and functional analysis of the type III secretion system from <span class="blue">Pseudomonas fluorescens Q8r1-96</span>. 

<span class="blue">Pseudomonas fluorescens Q8r1-96</span> represents a group of rhizosphere strains responsible for the suppressiveness of agricultural soils to take-all disease of <span class="yellow">wheat</span>. It produces the antibiotic 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol and aggressively colonizes the roots of cereal crops. In this study, we analyzed the genome of <span class="yellow">Q8r1-96</span> and identified a type III protein secretion system (T3SS) gene cluster that has overall organization similar to that of the T3SS gene cluster of the plant pathogen <span class="yellow">Pseudomonas syringae</span>. We also screened a collection of 30 closely related <span class="yellow">P. fluorescens strains</span> and detected the T3SS genes in all but one of them. The <span class="yellow">Q8r1-96</span> genome contained ropAA and ropM type III effector genes, which are orthologs of the <span class="yellow">P. syringae</span> effector genes hopAA1-1 and hopM1, as well as a novel type III effector gene designated ropB. These type III effector genes encoded proteins that were secreted in culture and injected into plant cells by both <span class="yellow">P. syringae</span> and <span class="yellow">Q8r1-96</span> T3SSs. The <span class="yellow">Q8r1-96</span> T3SS was expressed in the rhizosphere, but mutants lacking a functional T3SS were not altered in their rhizosphere competence. The <span class="yellow">Q8r1-96</span> type III effectors RopAA, RopB, and RopM were capable of suppressing the hypersensitive response and production of reactive oxygen species, two plant immune responses.
