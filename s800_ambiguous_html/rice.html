</br>
The body size ( snout - vent length ) of <b>rice</b> frogs on half of the islands was larger before and after the variable of age was controlled for ; <b>rice</b> frog density and prey availability was higher and prey size was larger on most of the islands as compared to the two mainland sites . 
</br>
On the islands , the body size and other features [ e . g . average age , the proportion of old - aged frogs ( ages 3 and 4 ) and density ] of the <b>rice</b> frogs were negatively associated with predator species richness ; female body size and other features were positively associated with prey availability . 
</br>
The reduced predator species richness was a dominant factor contributing to the body gigantism of <b>rice</b> frogs on the islands . 
</br>
Complementation of the mutant confirmed that SB__OsSPR1 is involved in post - embryonic root elongation and iron homeostasis in <b>rice</b> . 
</br>
Compatible interaction with its <b>rice</b> host leads to enhanced expression of the gamma subunit of oligosaccharyl transferase in the SB__Asian SI__rice SI__gall SI__midge , SB__Orseolia SI__oryzae . 
</br>
The SB__Asian SI__rice SI__gall SI__midge , SB__Orseolia SI__oryzae , is a fast evolving , damaging pest of <b>rice</b> . 
</br>
Understanding the underlying molecular mechanism of interaction between the gall midge and <b>rice</b> will help in devising strategies to control and manage the pest . 
</br>
The present study aims to identify <b>rice</b> - responsive genes in the gall midge that aid pest survival . 
</br>
The abundance of transcripts coding for enzymes related to glycosylation , in a cDNA library prepared from maggots of the <b>rice</b> gall midge feeding on susceptible hosts , indicated their probable involvement in the gall midge - <b>rice</b> interaction .

Race - specific resistance to the <b>rice</b> blast pathogen has not been durable and the mechanism by which the resistance is overcome remains largely unknown . 
</br>
In the many centuries SB__A SI__. SI__oryzae has been used for fermenting the starch in <b>rice</b> to simple sugars , it has undergone selection for increased secretion of starch - degrading enzymes .
