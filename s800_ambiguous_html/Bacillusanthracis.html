<h2>Bacillus anthracis</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20971910</h3>In vitro studies of peptidoglycan binding and hydrolysis by the <span class="blue">Bacillus anthracis</span> germination-specific lytic enzyme SleB. <br><br>The <span class="blue">Bacillus anthracis</span> endospore loses resistance properties during germination when its cortex peptidoglycan is degraded by germination-specific lytic enzymes (GSLEs). Although this event normally employs several GSLEs for complete cortex removal, the SleB protein alone can facilitate enough cortex hydrolysis to produce vulnerable spores. As a means to better understand its enzymatic function, SleB was overexpressed, purified, and tested in vitro for depolymerization of cortex by measurement of optical density loss and the solubilization of substrate. Its ability to bind peptidoglycan was also investigated. SleB functions independently as a lytic transglycosylase on both intact and fragmented cortex. Most of the muropeptide products that SleB generates are large and are potential substrates for other GSLEs present in the spore. Study of a truncated protein revealed that SleB has two domains. The N-terminal domain is required for stable peptidoglycan binding, while the C-terminal domain is the region of peptidoglycan hydrolytic activity. The C-terminal domain also exhibits dependence on cortex containing muramic-delta-lactam in order to carry out hydrolysis. As the conditions and limitations for SleB activity are further elucidated, they will enable the development of treatments that stimulate premature germination of <span class="yellow">B. anthracis</span> spores, greatly simplifying decontamination measures. 
<h3>20971911</h3>Glucose-dependent activation of <span class="blue">Bacillus anthracis</span> toxin gene expression and virulence requires the carbon catabolite protein CcpA. <br><br>Sensing environmental conditions is an essential aspect of bacterial physiology and virulence. In <span class="blue">Bacillus anthracis</span>, the causative agent of <span class="yellow">anthrax</span>, transcription of the two major virulence factors, toxin and capsule, is triggered by bicarbonate, a major compound in the mammalian body. Here it is shown that glucose is an additional signaling molecule recognized by <span class="yellow">B. anthracis</span> for toxin synthesis. The presence of glucose increased the expression of the protective antigen toxin component-encoding gene (pagA) by stimulating induction of transcription of the AtxA virulence transcription factor. Induction of atxA transcription by glucose required the carbon catabolite protein CcpA via an indirect mechanism. CcpA did not bind specifically to any region of the extended atxA promoter. The virulence of a <span class="yellow">B. anthracis strain</span> from which the ccpA gene was deleted was significantly attenuated in a <span class="yellow">mouse</span> model of infection. The data demonstrated that glucose is an important host environment-derived signaling molecule and that CcpA is a molecular link between environmental sensing and <span class="yellow">B. anthracis</span> pathogenesis. 
<h3>21131488</h3><span class="blue">Bacillus anthracis</span> sin locus and regulation of secreted proteases.<br><br><span class="blue">Bacillus anthracis</span> shares many regulatory loci with the nonpathogenic Bacillus species <span class="yellow">Bacillus subtilis</span>. One such locus is sinIR, which in <span class="yellow">B. subtilis</span> controls sporulation, biofilm formation, motility, and competency. As <span class="yellow">B. anthracis</span> is not known to be motile, to be naturally competent, or to readily form biofilms, we hypothesized that the <span class="yellow">B. anthracis</span> sinIR regulon is distinct from that of <span class="yellow">B. subtilis</span>. <span class="yellow">A</span> genome-wide expression microarray analysis of <span class="yellow">B. anthracis</span> parental and sinR mutant strains indicated limited convergence of the <span class="yellow">B. anthracis</span> and <span class="yellow">B. subtilis</span> SinR regulons. The <span class="yellow">B. anthracis</span> regulon includes homologues of some <span class="yellow">B. subtilis</span> SinR-regulated genes, including the signal peptidase gene sipW near the sinIR locus and the sporulation gene spoIIE. The <span class="yellow">B. anthracis</span> SinR protein also negatively regulates transcription of genes adjacent to the sinIR locus that are unique to the <span class="yellow">Bacillus cereus group species</span>. These include calY and inhA1, structural genes for the metalloproteases camelysin and immune inhibitor A1 (InhA1), which have been suggested to be associated with virulence in <span class="yellow">B. cereus</span> and <span class="yellow">B. anthracis</span>, respectively. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed direct binding of <span class="yellow">B. anthracis</span> SinR to promoter DNA from strongly regulated genes, such as calY and sipW, but not to the weakly regulated inhA1 gene. Assessment of camelysin and InhA1 levels in culture supernates from sinR-, inhA1-, and calY-null mutants showed that the concentration of InhA1 in the culture supernatant is inversely proportional to the concentration of camelysin. Our data are consistent with a model in which InhA1 protease levels are controlled at the transcriptional level by SinR and at the posttranslational level by camelysin.
