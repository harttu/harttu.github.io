<h2>NDV-H</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20962092</h3>Induction of type I interferon secretion through recombinant <span class="annotated ">Newcastle disease virus</span> expressing <span class="annotated ">measles virus</span> hemagglutinin stimulates antibody secretion in the presence of maternal antibodies. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Measles virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">MV</span>) vaccine effectively protects seronegative individuals against infection. However, inhibition of vaccine-induced seroconversion by maternal antibodies after vaccination remains a problem, as it leaves <span class="linneaus_only ">infants</span> susceptible to <span class="annotated ">MV</span> infection. In <span class="unannotated ">cotton</span> <span class="linneaus_only ">rats</span>, passive transfer of <span class="annotated ">MV</span>-specific IgG mimics maternal antibodies and inhibits vaccine-induced seroconversion. Here, we report that immunization in the presence of passively transferred IgG inhibits the secretion of neutralizing antibodies but not the generation of <span class="annotated ">MV</span>-specific B cells. This finding suggested that <span class="annotated ">MV</span>-specific B cells require an additional stimulus to mature into antibody-secreting plasma cells. In order to provide such a stimulus, we generated a recombinant <span class="annotated ">Newcastle disease virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">NDV</span>) expressing the <span class="annotated ">MV</span> hemagglutinin (<span class="match annotated ">NDV-H</span>). In contrast to <span class="annotated ">MV</span>, <span class="match annotated ">NDV-H</span> induced high levels of type I interferon in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and in lung tissue. In <span class="unannotated ">cotton</span> <span class="linneaus_only ">rats</span> immunized with <span class="match annotated ">NDV-H</span>, neutralizing antibodies were also generated in the presence of passively transferred antibodies. In the latter case, however, the level and kinetics of antibody generation were reduced. In vitro, alpha interferon stimulated the activation of <span class="annotated ">MV</span>-specific B cells from <span class="annotated ">MV</span>-immune spleen cells. <span class="annotated ">NDV</span> infection (which induces alpha interferon) had the same effect, and stimulation could be abrogated by antibodies neutralizing alpha interferon, but not interleukin 6 (IL-6). In vivo, coapplication of UV-inactivated <span class="annotated ">MV</span> with <span class="annotated ">NDV</span> led to increased <span class="annotated ">MV</span>-specific antibody production in the presence and absence of passively transferred antibodies. These data indicate that <span class="annotated ">MV</span>-specific B cells are being generated after immunization in the presence of maternal antibodies and that the provision of alpha interferon as an additional signal leads to antibody secretion.
