<h2>Heliothis virescens</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20946532</h3>Functional characterization of pheromone receptors in the <span class="annotated ">tobacco budworm</span> <span class="match annotated ">Heliothis virescens</span>. <br><br>Functional analyses of candidate <span class="match annotated ">Heliothis virescens</span> pheromone odorant receptors (HvORs) were conducted using heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes. HvOR6 was found to be highly tuned to Z9-14:Ald, while HvOR13, HvOR14 and HvOR16 showed specificity for Z11-16:Ald, Z11-16:OAc and Z11-16:OH, respectively. HvOR15, which had been considered a candidate receptor for Z9-14:Ald did not respond to any of the pheromone compounds tested, nor to 50 other general odorants. Thus, while HvOR15 is specifically expressed in <span class="annotated ">H. virescens</span> male antennae, its role in pheromone reception remains unknown. Based on our results and previous research we can now assign pheromone receptors in <span class="annotated ">H. virescens</span> males to each of the critical <span class="annotated ">H. virescens</span> agonistic pheromone compounds and two antagonistic compounds produced by heterospecific females. 
<h3>21521140</h3>Characterization of nonjunctional hemichannels in caterpillar cells.<br><br>Recent studies have demonstrated that hemichannels, which form gap junctions when paired from apposing cells, may serve additional roles when unpaired including cell adhesion and paracrine communication. Hemichannels in mammals are formed by connexins or pannexins, while in insects they are formed by pannexin homologues termed innexins. The formation of functional gap junctions by insect innexins has been established, although their ability to form functional nonjunctional hemichannels has not been reported. Here the characteristics of nonjunctional hemichannels were examined in three lepidopteran cell types, two cell lines (High Five and Sf9) and explanted hemocytes from <span class="match annotated ">Heliothis virescens</span> (Fabricius) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Selective fluorescent dye uptake by hemichannels was observed in a significant minority of cells, using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Carbenoxelone, an inhibitor of mammalian junctions, disrupted dye uptake, while flufenamic acid and mefloquine did not. The presence of Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) in the media increased hemichannel activity. Additionally, lipopolysaccharide, a stimulator of immune activity in lepidopterans, decreased dye uptake. These results demonstrate for the first time the activity of nonjunctional hemichannels in insect cells, as well as pharmacological tools to manipulate them. These results will facilitate the further examination of the role of innexins and nonjunctional hemichannels in insect cell biology, including paracrine signaling, and comparative studies of mammalian pannexins and insect innexins. 
<h3>21521143</h3>Post-egression host tissue feeding is another strategy of host regulation by the Koinobiont <span class="unannotated ">wasp</span>, <span class="annotated ">Toxoneuron nigriceps</span>. <br><br>Koinobiont wasps start their lives as hemolymph feeders inside the host body, but before they egress from the host many become tissue predators. One species, the endoparasitoid <span class="annotated ">Toxoneuron nigriceps</span> Viereck (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), exhibits the unusual behavior of egressing before initiating tissue predation. After egression from the host, it reinserts its head into the host body to begin tissue feeding. These third instar <span class="annotated ">T. nigriceps</span> larvae show a significant increase in body size and mass after post-egression feeding. Through this project the importance of post-egression feeding in the development of <span class="annotated ">T. nigriceps</span> in its host the <span class="annotated ">tobacco budworm</span>, <span class="match annotated ">Heliothis virescens</span> Fabricius (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), has been evaluated. The study was conducted by preventing the egressed third instar <span class="annotated ">T. nigriceps</span> larvae from feeding on host tissue and observing whether they could undergo further development. Though some of the larvae that were prevented from post-egression feeding did undergo cocoon formation, pupation, and adult emergence they were inferior in terms of size, body mass, and survival to those that developed from larvae allowed to feeding after egression. Hence, it is concluded that post-egression host tissue feeding is essential for the normal development of <span class="annotated ">T. nigriceps</span>, as the prevention of feeding resulted in significantly lighter and smaller larvae, cocoons, and adults as well as deformed adults and reduced adult survival. Post-egression feeding as a host regulatory strategy is discussed. 
<h3>20946534</h3>Differential expression of odorant receptor genes involved in the sexual isolation of two Heliothis moths. <br><br>Moth sexual communication systems are highly diverse, but the mechanisms underlying their evolutionary diversification remain unclear. Recently, genes coding for odorant receptors (ORs) OR6, OR14, OR15 and OR16 have been genetically associated with species-specific male response to female pheromone blends in <span class="match annotated ">Heliothis virescens</span> (<span class="annotated ">Hv</span>) and <span class="annotated ">Heliothis subflexa</span> (<span class="annotated ">Hs</span>). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicates that expression of HvOR6, HsOR6, HvOR14, HsOR14, HvOR15 and HsOR15 is male biased, which supports the hypothesis that they have a role in mediating female sex pheromone detection. The genes HvOR14, HvOR15 and HvOR16 are expressed at higher levels than their corresponding orthologues HsOR14, HsOR15 and HsOR16 in male antennae, while HvOR6 and HsOR6 transcripts are equally abundant in male antennae. The lack of higher expression of any of the receptor genes in <span class="annotated ">H. subflexa</span> antennae suggests that interspecific sequence differences, rather than gene regulation differences, underly the species-specific male response to pheromone components.
