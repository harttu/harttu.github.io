<h2>respiratory syncytial virus</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20980510</h3>Assembly and immunological properties of <span class="yellow">Newcastle disease virus</span>-like particles containing the <span class="blue">respiratory syncytial virus</span> F and G proteins. <br><br><span class="yellow">Human respiratory syncytial virus</span> (<span class="yellow">RSV</span>) is a serious respiratory pathogen in infants and young children as well as elderly and immunocompromised populations. However, no <span class="yellow">RSV</span> vaccines are available. We have explored the potential of virus-like particles (VLPs) as an <span class="yellow">RSV</span> vaccine candidate. VLPs composed entirely of <span class="yellow">RSV</span> proteins were produced at levels inadequate for their preparation as immunogens. However, VLPs composed of the <span class="yellow">Newcastle disease virus</span> (<span class="yellow">NDV</span>) nucleocapsid and membrane proteins and chimera proteins containing the ectodomains of <span class="yellow">RSV</span> F and G proteins fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of <span class="yellow">NDV</span> F and HN proteins, respectively, were quantitatively prepared from avian cells. Immunization of <span class="yellow">mice</span> with these VLPs, without adjuvant, stimulated robust, anti-<span class="yellow">RSV</span> F and G protein antibody responses. IgG2a/IgG1 ratios were very high, suggesting predominantly T(H)1 responses. In contrast to infectious <span class="yellow">RSV</span> immunization, neutralization antibody titers were robust and stable for 4 months. Immunization with a single dose of VLPs resulted in the complete protection of <span class="yellow">mice</span> from <span class="yellow">RSV</span> replication in lungs. Upon <span class="yellow">RSV</span> intranasal challenge of VLP-immunized <span class="yellow">mice</span>, no enhanced lung pathology was observed, in contrast to the pathology observed in <span class="yellow">mice</span> immunized with formalin-inactivated <span class="yellow">RSV</span>. These results suggest that these VLPs are effective <span class="yellow">RSV</span> vaccines in <span class="yellow">mice</span>, in contrast to other nonreplicating <span class="yellow">RSV</span> vaccine candidates. 
<h3>21435708</h3>Viral pneumonia.<br><br>About 200 million cases of <span class="yellow">viral</span> community-acquired pneumonia occur every year-100 million in children and 100 million in adults. Molecular diagnostic tests have greatly increased our understanding of the role of viruses in pneumonia, and findings indicate that the incidence of <span class="yellow">viral</span> pneumonia has been underestimated. In children, <span class="blue">respiratory syncytial virus</span>, rhinovirus, <span class="yellow">human metapneumovirus</span>, <span class="yellow">human bocavirus</span>, and parainfluenza viruses are the agents identified most frequently in both developed and developing countries. Dual <span class="yellow">viral</span> infections are common, and a third of children have evidence of viral-bacterial co-infection. In adults, viruses are the putative causative agents in a third of cases of community-acquired pneumonia, in particular <span class="yellow">influenza viruses</span>, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses. Bacteria continue to have a predominant role in adults with pneumonia. Presence of <span class="yellow">viral</span> epidemics in the community, patient's age, speed of onset of illness, symptoms, biomarkers, radiographic changes, and response to treatment can help differentiate <span class="yellow">viral</span> from bacterial pneumonia. However, no clinical algorithm exists that will distinguish clearly the cause of pneumonia. No clear consensus has been reached about whether patients with obvious <span class="yellow">viral</span> community-acquired pneumonia need to be treated with antibiotics. Apart from neuraminidase inhibitors for pneumonia caused by <span class="yellow">influenza viruses</span>, there is no clear role for use of specific antivirals to treat <span class="yellow">viral</span> community-acquired pneumonia. Influenza vaccines are the only available specific preventive measures. Further studies are needed to better understand the cause and pathogenesis of community-acquired pneumonia. Furthermore, regional differences in cause of pneumonia should be investigated, in particular to obtain more data from developing countries. 
<h3>21034773</h3>Comparison of commercial systems for extraction of nucleic acids from DNA/RNA respiratory pathogens. <br><br>This study compared six automated nucleic acid extraction systems and one manual kit for their ability to recover nucleic acids from <span class="yellow">human</span> nasal wash specimens spiked with five respiratory pathogens, representing Gram-positive bacteria (<span class="yellow">Streptococcus pyogenes</span>), Gram-negative bacteria (<span class="yellow">Legionella pneumophila</span>), DNA viruses (adenovirus), segmented RNA viruses (<span class="yellow">human influenza virus A</span>), and non-segmented RNA viruses (<span class="blue">respiratory syncytial virus</span>). The robots and kit evaluated represent major commercially available methods that are capable of simultaneous extraction of DNA and RNA from respiratory specimens, and included platforms based on magnetic-bead technology (KingFisher mL, Biorobot EZ1, easyMAG, KingFisher Flex, and MagNA Pure Compact) or glass fiber filter technology (Biorobot MDX and the manual kit Allprep). All methods yielded extracts free of cross-contamination and RT-PCR inhibition. All automated systems recovered <span class="yellow">L. pneumophila</span> and <span class="yellow">adenovirus</span> DNA equivalently. However, the MagNA Pure protocol demonstrated more than 4-fold higher DNA recovery from the <span class="yellow">S. pyogenes</span> than other methods. The KingFisher mL and easyMAG protocols provided 1- to 3-log wider linearity and extracted 3- to 4-fold more RNA from the <span class="yellow">human influenza virus</span> and <span class="blue">respiratory syncytial virus</span>. These findings suggest that systems differed in nucleic acid recovery, reproducibility, and linearity in a pathogen specific manner.
