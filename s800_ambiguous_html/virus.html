</br>
* In this study , we took advantage of a chlorotic phenotype elicited by COR on SB__Nicotiana SI__benthamiana leaves and <b>virus</b> - induced gene silencing ( VIGS ) as a rapid reverse genetic screening tool and identified a role for SGT1 ( suppressor of G2 allele of skp1 ) in COR - induced chlorosis . 
</br>
Hytrosaviridae is a proposed <b>virus</b> family encompassing viruses that cause salivary gland hypertrophy ( SGH ) syndrome in infected insects and reduce the fertility in their dipteran insect hosts . 
</br>
The limited number of hytrosaviruses reported to date may be a reflection of the frequent absence of external symptoms in infected adult flies and the fact that the <b>virus</b> does not cause rapid mortality . 
</br>
Four primer pairs generated a <b>virus</b> specific PCR product on both MdSGHV and GpSGHV at all tested annealing temperatures , while the ODV - e66 based primers did not generate a <b>virus</b> specific product with annealing temperatures higher that 47 ^ 0C . 
</br>
Simultaneous <b>virus</b> - specific detection of the two SB__cassava brown streak - associated viruses by RT - PCR reveals wide distribution in East Africa , mixed infections , and infections in SB__Manihot SI__glaziovii . 
</br>
A reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) based diagnostic method was developed in this study for simultaneous <b>virus</b> - specific detection of the two viruses . 
</br>
SB__CBSV was also detected in the perennial species SB__Manihot SI__glaziovii ( DNA - barcoded in this study ) in Tanzania , which revealed the first <b>virus</b> reservoir other than SB__cassava . 
</br>
This study investigated the suitability of a two step real - time RT - PCR melting curve analysis as a tool for the detection and discrimination of nine species in the plant <b>virus</b> family Luteoviridae , being SB__Soybean SI__dwarf SI__virus [ SB__SbDV ] , SB__Bean SI__leafroll SI__virus [ SB__BLRV ] , SB__Beet SI__chlorosis SI__virus [ SB__BChV ] , SB__Beet SI__mild SI__yellowing SI__virus [ SB__BMYV ] , SB__Beet SI__western SI__yellows SI__virus [ SB__BWYV ] , SB__Cereal SI__yellow SI__dwarf SI__virus SI__- SI__RPV [ SB__CYDV SI__- SI__RPV ] , SB__Cucurbit SI__aphid SI__- SI__borne SI__yellows SI__virus [ SB__CABYV ] , SB__Potato SI__leafroll SI__virus [ SB__PLRV ] and SB__Turnip SI__yellows SI__virus [ SB__TuYV ] . 
</br>
In recent years the rate of SB__TBE infection has been raising and the <b>virus</b> has been spreading to new areas . 
</br>
Adaptation of a Madin - Darby SB__canine kidney cell line to suspension growth in serum - free media and comparison of its ability to produce avian influenza <b>virus</b> to Vero and BHK21 cell lines . 
</br>
The production of avian influenza <b>virus</b> by BHK21 , Vero and MDCK - SFS cell lines was compared . 
</br>
MDCK - SFS cells yielded the highest infectious <b>virus</b> titres and <b>virus</b> genome equivalent concentration for five of the eight influenza strains analyzed and the highest hemagglutination activity for all eight <b>virus</b> strains . 
</br>
Taken together with their suitability for suspension growth this makes the MDCK - SFS cell line potentially useful for large scale influenza <b>virus</b> production . 
</br>
The importance of the 2 ' - 5 ' oligoadenylate synthetase ( OAS ) / RNase L and double - stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) - dependent protein kinase ( PKR ) pathways in host interferon induction resulting from <b>virus</b> infection in response to dsRNA has been well documented . 
</br>
These results also suggest that an unanticipated role of the K3L gene is to facilitate <b>virus</b> dissemination . 
</br>
Rapid methods to detect and differentiate the <b>virus</b> are important to curtail the spread of this <b>virus</b> . 
</br>
Nucleic acid based detection methods are routinely employed for diagnosis that suffer from the disadvantage of failure to discriminate viable <b>virus</b> and non - infectious genome . 
</br>
However , <b>virus</b> isolation remains the gold standard for diagnosis of field outbreaks . 
</br>
The sensitivity of <b>virus</b> isolation was combined with nucleic acid based detection methods so that the time taken for confirmatory diagnosis could be considerably reduced while increasing sensitivity . 
</br>
Quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( qRT - PCR ) and conventional RT - PCR techniques were compared for the detection of SB__NDV genome replication in 9 - 11 - day - old embryonated SB__chicken eggs ( ECE ) using the nucleoprotein ( NP ) gene of the <b>virus</b> as a target . 
</br>
The results suggest that at least two to fourfold increase in cycle threshold ( C ( t ) ) values over the baseline C ( t ) value of samples lacking infectious <b>virus</b> , would indicate live SB__NDV replication . 
</br>
The earliest time point when live <b>virus</b> replication was detectable by qRT - PCR or RT - PCR was 30h post - inoculation in ECE . 
</br>
Antibodies obtained from SB__rabbits and guinea pigs immunized with cell - culture - adapted <b>virus</b> strains ( SB__O SI__/ SI__CHA SI__/ SI__99 , SB__A SI__/ SI__GS SI__/ SI__LX SI__/ SI__66 , SB__Asia SI__1 SI__/ SI__CHN SI__/ SI__05 ) and suckling - SB__mouse adapted <b>virus</b> strains ( SB__O SI__/ SI__AV99 SI__( SI__L SI__) , SB__A SI__/ SI__AV88 SI__( SI__L SI__) , SB__Asia SI__1 SI__/ SI__YNBS SI__/ SI__58 ) were used as capture antibodies . 
</br>
However , re - infections and new introductions of <b>virus</b> into farms require a confirmatory virological test to verify the positive test results of single animals and ultimately to investigate disease transmission . 
</br>
Hepatitis C <b>virus</b> ( SB__HCV ) can initiate infection by cell - free particle and cell - cell contact - dependent transmission . 
</br>
However , scavenger receptor BI ( SR - BI ) has a more prominent role in cell - to - cell transmission of the <b>virus</b> , with SR - BI - specific antibodies and small - molecule inhibitors showing preferential inhibition of this infection route . 
</br>
Despite the current and potential danger posed by this <b>virus</b> , we know surprisingly little about the induction and evasion of SB__CHIKV - associated antiviral immune responses . 
</br>
With this in mind we investigated innate immune reactions to SB__CHIKV in SB__human fibroblasts , a demonstrable in vivo target of <b>virus</b> replication and spread . 
</br>
IRF3 activation occurs by way of a <b>virus</b> - induced innate immune signaling pathway that includes the adaptor molecule interferon promoter stimulator 1 ( IPS - 1 ) . 
</br>
The pandemic H1N1 ( H1N1pdm ) <b>virus</b> is the predominant SB__influenza SI__virus strain in the SB__human population . 
</br>
Because the new pandemic strain is a triple - reassortant ( TR ) <b>virus</b> , we chose to introduce the double attenuating modifications into a SB__swine - like TR <b>virus</b> isolate , SB__A SI__/ SI__turkey SI__/ SI__OH SI__/ SI__313053 SI__/ SI__04 SI__( SI__H3N2 SI__) ( ty / 04 ) , with the goal of producing live attenuated influenza vaccines ( LAIV ) . 
</br>
This genetically modified backbone had impaired polymerase activity and restricted <b>virus</b> growth at elevated temperatures . 
</br>
A single immunization with the ty / 04 att - based vaccines conferred complete protection against a lethal H1N1pdm <b>virus</b> infection in mice . 
</br>
More importantly , vaccination of pigs with a ty / 04 att - H1N1 vaccine candidate resulted in sterilizing immunity upon an aggressive intratracheal challenge with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic <b>virus</b> . 
</br>
SB__Poliovirus ( SB__PV ) is a plus - strand RNA <b>virus</b> containing a genome that is a functional mRNA ; thus , we investigated if SB__PV antagonizes the processes that lead to formation of these structures . 
</br>
However , the underlying molecular mechanisms of <b>virus</b> - induced cancers are complex and require further investigation . 
</br>
SB__Human SI__immunodeficiency SI__virus ( SB__HIV ) - positive individuals can be superinfected with different <b>virus</b> strains . 
</br>
Natural killer ( NK ) cells are a key component of the innate immune system with the ability to kill diverse tumor cells and <b>virus</b> - infected cells . 
</br>
When used to immunize SB__rabbits , this SB__yeast elicits antibodies that bind to gp120 - associated glycans but fail to neutralize <b>virus</b> . 
</br>
This implies that the underlying structure of the protein scaffold used to present the high - mannose glycans may be critical to allow elicitation of antibodies that recognize trimeric Env and neutralize <b>virus</b> . 
</br>
SB__Retroviral Gag proteins contain short late - domain motifs that recruit cellular ESCRT pathway proteins to facilitate <b>virus</b> budding . 
</br>
Crystal structures revealed that anchoring tyrosines ( in lightface ) and nearby hydrophobic residues ( underlined ) contact the ALIX V domain , revealing how lentiviruses employ a diverse family of late - domain sequences to bind ALIX and promote <b>virus</b> budding . 
</br>
The current methods for manipulation of enteroviral RNA genomes and production of modified <b>virus</b> particles include stepwise subcloning procedures and in vitro transcription and RNA transfection steps that are both time - consuming and inefficient . 
</br>
Several enteroviral cDNA clones with 5 ' - terminal T7 promoter and SB__coxsackievirus SI__A9 ( SB__CAV9 ) PCR product with the T7 promoter were transfected successfully into target cells expressing T7 RNA polymerase for the rescue of <b>virus</b> particles . 
</br>
The classical nuclear factor kappa B ( NF - kappaB ) signaling pathway is an important regulator of inflammation and innate immunity that is activated by a wide variety of stimuli , including <b>virus</b> infection , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - alpha ) , and interleukin 1Beta ( IL - 1Beta ) . 
</br>
Template recognition mechanisms by replicase proteins differ between bipartite positive - strand genomic RNAs of a plant <b>virus</b> . 
</br>
Successful vaccination strategies that protect aged SB__mice from lethal challenge from influenza <b>virus</b> and heterologous SB__severe SI__acute SI__respiratory SI__syndrome SI__coronavirus . 
</br>
The newly emerging SB__severe SI__acute SI__respiratory SI__syndrome SI__coronavirus ( SB__SARS SI__- SI__CoV ) and reemerging influenza <b>virus</b> cause disproportionate disease in the aged , who are also notoriously difficult to successfully vaccinate , likely due to immunosenescence . 
</br>
The superior protection for the aged observed with VRP ( 3000 ) - based vaccines was confirmed in a lethal influenza <b>virus</b> challenge model . 
</br>
Exploration into the mechanism ( s ) of successful vaccination in the immunosenescent should aid in the development of successful vaccine strategies for other viral diseases disproportionately affecting the elderly , like SB__West SI__Nile SI__virus , influenza <b>virus</b> , norovirus , or other emerging viruses of the future . 
</br>
We have explored the potential of <b>virus</b> - like particles ( VLPs ) as an SB__RSV vaccine candidate . 
</br>
Reverse genetics generation of chimeric infectious Junin / Lassa <b>virus</b> is dependent on interaction of homologous glycoprotein stable signal peptide and G2 cytoplasmic domains . 
</br>
In an effort to improve upon the existing live attenuated SB__JUNV Candid1 vaccine , we generated a genetically homogenous stock of this <b>virus</b> from cDNA copies of the <b>virus</b> S and L segments by using a reverse genetics system . 
</br>
Here we examined the role of B7 costimulatory ligands in establishing immune detente from both the host and <b>virus</b> perspectives . 
</br>
SB__Mice lacking both B7 . 1 and B7 . 2 showed reduced early expansion of CMV - specific CD4 T cells , consequently allowing for enhanced levels of persistent <b>virus</b> replication . 
</br>
Together , these data reveal a requirement for B7 - mediated signaling in regulating the CMV - specific CD4 T cell response and establishing host - <b>virus</b> equilibrium . 
</br>
Varicella - zoster <b>virus</b> ( SB__VZV ) reactivation causes herpes zoster , which is accompanied by an influx of lymphocytes into affected ganglia , but the stimulus for this infiltrate is not known . 
</br>
The immunologic mechanisms underlying the faster progression of hepatitis C <b>virus</b> ( SB__HCV ) disease in the presence of SB__human SI__immunodeficiency SI__virus ( SB__HIV ) coinfection are not clearly understood . 
</br>
T - cell cross - reactivity between SB__HCV and influenza <b>virus</b> - specific epitopes has been associated with rapid progression of SB__HCV disease ( S . Urbani , B . Amadei , P . Fisicaro , M . Pilli , G . Missale , A . Bertoletti , and C . Ferrari , J . Exp . Med . 201 : 675 - 680 , 2005 ) . 
</br>
However , the induction of cross - reactive T cells may not be associated with control of disease caused by the heterologous <b>virus</b> . 
</br>
To explore the protection mechanisms in vivo , we primed mice with SB__H1 and SB__H3 SI__influenza SI__virus isolates and rechallenged them with a <b>virus</b> derived from the SB__2009 SI__H1N1 SI__A SI__/ SI__CA SI__/ SI__04 SI__/ SI__09 SI__virus , named CA / E3 / 09 . 
</br>
We found that priming with influenza viruses of both SB__H1 and H3 homo - and heterosubtypes protected against lethal CA / E3 / 09 <b>virus</b> challenge . 
</br>
In India , there has been co - circulation , extinction and emergence of genotypes / lineages within serotype A foot - and - mouth disease ( SB__FMD ) <b>virus</b> . 
</br>
Systemic <b>virus</b> - induced gene silencing allows functional characterization of SB__maize genes during biotrophic interaction with SB__Ustilago SI__maydis . 
</br>
To identify SB__maize genes that are functionally involved in the interaction with SB__U SI__. SI__maydis , we adapted a <b>virus</b> - induced gene silencing ( VIGS ) system based on the brome mosaic <b>virus</b> ( BMV ) for SB__maize . 
</br>
Complement opsonization enhances friend <b>virus</b> infection of B cells and thereby amplifies the <b>virus</b> - specific CD8 + T cell response . 
</br>
B cells are one of the targets of Friend <b>virus</b> ( FV ) infection , a well - established mouse model often used to study SB__retroviral infections in vivo . 
</br>
Plasma membrane Ca ^ 2 + transporters mediate <b>virus</b> - induced acquired resistance to oxidative stress . 
</br>
In order to facilitate the identification of proteins that may interact with SB__MMV either by facilitating acquisition or responding to <b>virus</b> infection , we generated and analysed the gut transcriptome of SB__P SI__. SI__maidis . 
</br>
Little is known about endosomal pathway proteins involved in arthropod - borne <b>virus</b> ( arbovirus ) assembly and cell - to - cell spread in vector mosquitoes . 
</br>
Transient gene silencing of SV2 or UNC93A in mosquitoes infected with the recombinant alphavirus SB__Sindbis MRE16 - enhanced green fluorescent protein ( SB__SINV ; family Togaviridae ) resulted in the accumulation of viral positive - and negative - strand RNA , congregation of <b>virus</b> envelope antigen in intracellular networks , and reduced <b>virus</b> dissemination outside of the midgut . 
</br>
Together , these data support a role for UNC93A and SV2 in <b>virus</b> assembly or budding . 
</br>
SB__Hepatitis SI__delta SI__virus ( SB__HDV ) is a small , defective RNA <b>virus</b> that can infect only individuals who have SB__hepatitis SI__B SI__virus ( SB__HBV ) ; worldwide more than 15 million people are co - infected . 
</br>
Through curing <b>virus</b> - infected SB__A SI__. SI__fumigatus isolates by cycloheximide treatment and transfecting <b>virus</b> - free isolates with purified <b>virus</b> , as checked by RT - PCR , isogenic <b>virus</b> - free and <b>virus</b> - infected lines of the fungus were generated whose phenotypes and growth have been directly compared . 
</br>
Selection of a jacalin - resistant SB__SIVmac239 variant population resulted in <b>virus</b> with specific substitutions within amino acids 128 to 139 . 
</br>
In contrast , gEDeltaCys , which lacks gE / gI heterodimer formation , was significantly impaired at early times postinfection ; viral genome copy numbers increased slowly , and infectious <b>virus</b> production was not detected until day 28 . 
</br>
The replication of gE - AYRV , which is impaired for trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) localization , and the replication of gE - SSTT , which contains mutations in an acidic cluster , were equivalent to that of rOka , causing significant cytopathic effects and infectious <b>virus</b> production by day 14 ; genome copy numbers were equivalent to those of rOka . 
</br>
Viral inhibition among three different types of <b>virus</b> by transgenic 3D ( pol ) suggests that the mechanism of action is not the direct interference with picornaviral 3D ( pol ) but instead may be the changing of host cells to an antiviral state before or after viral infection occurs , as basal interferon levels were higher in 3D ( pol ) transgenic SB__mice before infection . 
</br>
Here , we demonstrate that the increase in translation factor concentration was readily detected in an asynchronous population of SB__HCMV - infected primary SB__human fibroblasts , abolished by prior UV inactivation of <b>virus</b> , and genetically dependent upon viral immediate - early genes . 
</br>
While <b>virus</b> - induced PABP accumulation did not require p70 S6K , it was inhibited by the expression of a dominant - acting 4E - BP1 variant unable to be inactivated by mTORC1 . 
</br>
Here , we have used anew humanized SB__mouse model , in which both SB__human fetal CD34 ( + ) hematopoietic stemcells and thymus / liver tissue are transplanted , to compare SB__EBV pathogenesis andlymphoma formation following infection with a lytic replication - defectiveBZLF1 - deleted ( Z - KO ) <b>virus</b> or a lytically active BZLF1 ( + ) control . 
</br>
Animalsinfected with the control <b>virus</b> developed tumors more frequently than Z - KOvirus - infected animals . 
</br>
Specific immune responses against SB__EBV - infected B cellswere generated in SB__mice infected with either the control <b>virus</b> or the Z - KOvirus . 
</br>
This <b>virus</b> was used to assess the relevance of P and V interactions with STAT1 for virulence in primates . 
</br>
The STAT1 - blind <b>virus</b> less efficiently controlled the inflammatory response , as measured by enhanced transcription of interleukin - 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from infected hosts . 
</br>
Importantly , neutralizing antibody titers and SB__MV - specific T - cell responses were equivalent in hosts infected with either <b>virus</b> . 
</br>
These findings indicate that efficient SB__MV interactions with STAT1 are required to sustain virulence in a natural host by controlling the inflammatory response against the <b>virus</b> . 
</br>
RNA aptamers directed to SB__human SI__immunodeficiency SI__virus SI__type SI__1 Gag polyprotein bind to the matrix and nucleocapsid domains and inhibit <b>virus</b> production . 
</br>
SB__Mud SI__crab SI__dicistrovirus ( SB__MCDV ) , a newly identified single - stranded positive RNA <b>virus</b> , is an important pathogen that causes serious economic losses to SB__mud SI__crab aquaculture . 
</br>
* In this study , we took advantage of a chlorotic phenotype elicited by COR on SB__Nicotiana SI__benthamiana leaves and <b>virus</b> - induced gene silencing ( VIGS ) as a rapid reverse genetic screening tool and identified a role for SGT1 ( suppressor of G2 allele of skp1 ) in COR - induced chlorosis . 
</br>
Hytrosaviridae is a proposed <b>virus</b> family encompassing viruses that cause salivary gland hypertrophy ( SGH ) syndrome in infected insects and reduce the fertility in their dipteran insect hosts . 
</br>
The limited number of hytrosaviruses reported to date may be a reflection of the frequent absence of external symptoms in infected adult flies and the fact that the <b>virus</b> does not cause rapid mortality . 
</br>
Four primer pairs generated a <b>virus</b> specific PCR product on both MdSGHV and GpSGHV at all tested annealing temperatures , while the ODV - e66 based primers did not generate a <b>virus</b> specific product with annealing temperatures higher that 47 ^ 0C . 
</br>
Simultaneous <b>virus</b> - specific detection of the two SB__cassava brown streak - associated viruses by RT - PCR reveals wide distribution in East Africa , mixed infections , and infections in SB__Manihot SI__glaziovii . 
</br>
A reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) based diagnostic method was developed in this study for simultaneous <b>virus</b> - specific detection of the two viruses . 
</br>
SB__CBSV was also detected in the perennial species SB__Manihot SI__glaziovii ( DNA - barcoded in this study ) in Tanzania , which revealed the first <b>virus</b> reservoir other than SB__cassava . 
</br>
This study investigated the suitability of a two step real - time RT - PCR melting curve analysis as a tool for the detection and discrimination of nine species in the plant <b>virus</b> family Luteoviridae , being SB__Soybean SI__dwarf SI__virus [ SB__SbDV ] , SB__Bean SI__leafroll SI__virus [ SB__BLRV ] , SB__Beet SI__chlorosis SI__virus [ SB__BChV ] , SB__Beet SI__mild SI__yellowing SI__virus [ SB__BMYV ] , SB__Beet SI__western SI__yellows SI__virus [ SB__BWYV ] , SB__Cereal SI__yellow SI__dwarf SI__virus SI__- SI__RPV [ SB__CYDV SI__- SI__RPV ] , SB__Cucurbit SI__aphid SI__- SI__borne SI__yellows SI__virus [ SB__CABYV ] , SB__Potato SI__leafroll SI__virus [ SB__PLRV ] and SB__Turnip SI__yellows SI__virus [ SB__TuYV ] . 
</br>
In recent years the rate of SB__TBE infection has been raising and the <b>virus</b> has been spreading to new areas . 
</br>
Adaptation of a Madin - Darby SB__canine kidney cell line to suspension growth in serum - free media and comparison of its ability to produce avian influenza <b>virus</b> to Vero and BHK21 cell lines . 
</br>
The production of avian influenza <b>virus</b> by BHK21 , Vero and MDCK - SFS cell lines was compared . 
</br>
MDCK - SFS cells yielded the highest infectious <b>virus</b> titres and <b>virus</b> genome equivalent concentration for five of the eight influenza strains analyzed and the highest hemagglutination activity for all eight <b>virus</b> strains . 
</br>
Taken together with their suitability for suspension growth this makes the MDCK - SFS cell line potentially useful for large scale influenza <b>virus</b> production . 
</br>
The importance of the 2 ' - 5 ' oligoadenylate synthetase ( OAS ) / RNase L and double - stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) - dependent protein kinase ( PKR ) pathways in host interferon induction resulting from <b>virus</b> infection in response to dsRNA has been well documented . 
</br>
These results also suggest that an unanticipated role of the K3L gene is to facilitate <b>virus</b> dissemination . 
</br>
Rapid methods to detect and differentiate the <b>virus</b> are important to curtail the spread of this <b>virus</b> . 
</br>
Nucleic acid based detection methods are routinely employed for diagnosis that suffer from the disadvantage of failure to discriminate viable <b>virus</b> and non - infectious genome . 
</br>
However , <b>virus</b> isolation remains the gold standard for diagnosis of field outbreaks . 
</br>
The sensitivity of <b>virus</b> isolation was combined with nucleic acid based detection methods so that the time taken for confirmatory diagnosis could be considerably reduced while increasing sensitivity . 
</br>
Quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( qRT - PCR ) and conventional RT - PCR techniques were compared for the detection of SB__NDV genome replication in 9 - 11 - day - old embryonated SB__chicken eggs ( ECE ) using the nucleoprotein ( NP ) gene of the <b>virus</b> as a target . 
</br>
The results suggest that at least two to fourfold increase in cycle threshold ( C ( t ) ) values over the baseline C ( t ) value of samples lacking infectious <b>virus</b> , would indicate live SB__NDV replication . 
</br>
The earliest time point when live <b>virus</b> replication was detectable by qRT - PCR or RT - PCR was 30h post - inoculation in ECE . 
</br>
Antibodies obtained from SB__rabbits and guinea pigs immunized with cell - culture - adapted <b>virus</b> strains ( SB__O SI__/ SI__CHA SI__/ SI__99 , SB__A SI__/ SI__GS SI__/ SI__LX SI__/ SI__66 , SB__Asia SI__1 SI__/ SI__CHN SI__/ SI__05 ) and suckling - SB__mouse adapted <b>virus</b> strains ( SB__O SI__/ SI__AV99 SI__( SI__L SI__) , SB__A SI__/ SI__AV88 SI__( SI__L SI__) , SB__Asia SI__1 SI__/ SI__YNBS SI__/ SI__58 ) were used as capture antibodies . 
</br>
However , re - infections and new introductions of <b>virus</b> into farms require a confirmatory virological test to verify the positive test results of single animals and ultimately to investigate disease transmission . 
</br>
Hepatitis C <b>virus</b> ( SB__HCV ) can initiate infection by cell - free particle and cell - cell contact - dependent transmission . 
</br>
However , scavenger receptor BI ( SR - BI ) has a more prominent role in cell - to - cell transmission of the <b>virus</b> , with SR - BI - specific antibodies and small - molecule inhibitors showing preferential inhibition of this infection route . 
</br>
Despite the current and potential danger posed by this <b>virus</b> , we know surprisingly little about the induction and evasion of SB__CHIKV - associated antiviral immune responses . 
</br>
With this in mind we investigated innate immune reactions to SB__CHIKV in SB__human fibroblasts , a demonstrable in vivo target of <b>virus</b> replication and spread . 
</br>
IRF3 activation occurs by way of a <b>virus</b> - induced innate immune signaling pathway that includes the adaptor molecule interferon promoter stimulator 1 ( IPS - 1 ) . 
</br>
The pandemic H1N1 ( H1N1pdm ) <b>virus</b> is the predominant SB__influenza SI__virus strain in the SB__human population . 
</br>
Because the new pandemic strain is a triple - reassortant ( TR ) <b>virus</b> , we chose to introduce the double attenuating modifications into a SB__swine - like TR <b>virus</b> isolate , SB__A SI__/ SI__turkey SI__/ SI__OH SI__/ SI__313053 SI__/ SI__04 SI__( SI__H3N2 SI__) ( ty / 04 ) , with the goal of producing live attenuated influenza vaccines ( LAIV ) . 
</br>
This genetically modified backbone had impaired polymerase activity and restricted <b>virus</b> growth at elevated temperatures . 
</br>
A single immunization with the ty / 04 att - based vaccines conferred complete protection against a lethal H1N1pdm <b>virus</b> infection in mice . 
</br>
More importantly , vaccination of pigs with a ty / 04 att - H1N1 vaccine candidate resulted in sterilizing immunity upon an aggressive intratracheal challenge with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic <b>virus</b> . 
</br>
SB__Poliovirus ( SB__PV ) is a plus - strand RNA <b>virus</b> containing a genome that is a functional mRNA ; thus , we investigated if SB__PV antagonizes the processes that lead to formation of these structures . 
</br>
However , the underlying molecular mechanisms of <b>virus</b> - induced cancers are complex and require further investigation . 
</br>
SB__Human SI__immunodeficiency SI__virus ( SB__HIV ) - positive individuals can be superinfected with different <b>virus</b> strains . 
</br>
Natural killer ( NK ) cells are a key component of the innate immune system with the ability to kill diverse tumor cells and <b>virus</b> - infected cells . 
</br>
When used to immunize SB__rabbits , this SB__yeast elicits antibodies that bind to gp120 - associated glycans but fail to neutralize <b>virus</b> . 
</br>
This implies that the underlying structure of the protein scaffold used to present the high - mannose glycans may be critical to allow elicitation of antibodies that recognize trimeric Env and neutralize <b>virus</b> . 
</br>
SB__Retroviral Gag proteins contain short late - domain motifs that recruit cellular ESCRT pathway proteins to facilitate <b>virus</b> budding . 
</br>
Crystal structures revealed that anchoring tyrosines ( in lightface ) and nearby hydrophobic residues ( underlined ) contact the ALIX V domain , revealing how lentiviruses employ a diverse family of late - domain sequences to bind ALIX and promote <b>virus</b> budding . 
</br>
The current methods for manipulation of enteroviral RNA genomes and production of modified <b>virus</b> particles include stepwise subcloning procedures and in vitro transcription and RNA transfection steps that are both time - consuming and inefficient . 
</br>
Several enteroviral cDNA clones with 5 ' - terminal T7 promoter and SB__coxsackievirus SI__A9 ( SB__CAV9 ) PCR product with the T7 promoter were transfected successfully into target cells expressing T7 RNA polymerase for the rescue of <b>virus</b> particles . 
</br>
The classical nuclear factor kappa B ( NF - kappaB ) signaling pathway is an important regulator of inflammation and innate immunity that is activated by a wide variety of stimuli , including <b>virus</b> infection , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - alpha ) , and interleukin 1Beta ( IL - 1Beta ) . 
</br>
Template recognition mechanisms by replicase proteins differ between bipartite positive - strand genomic RNAs of a plant <b>virus</b> . 
</br>
Successful vaccination strategies that protect aged SB__mice from lethal challenge from influenza <b>virus</b> and heterologous SB__severe SI__acute SI__respiratory SI__syndrome SI__coronavirus . 
</br>
The newly emerging SB__severe SI__acute SI__respiratory SI__syndrome SI__coronavirus ( SB__SARS SI__- SI__CoV ) and reemerging influenza <b>virus</b> cause disproportionate disease in the aged , who are also notoriously difficult to successfully vaccinate , likely due to immunosenescence . 
</br>
The superior protection for the aged observed with VRP ( 3000 ) - based vaccines was confirmed in a lethal influenza <b>virus</b> challenge model . 
</br>
Exploration into the mechanism ( s ) of successful vaccination in the immunosenescent should aid in the development of successful vaccine strategies for other viral diseases disproportionately affecting the elderly , like SB__West SI__Nile SI__virus , influenza <b>virus</b> , norovirus , or other emerging viruses of the future . 
</br>
We have explored the potential of <b>virus</b> - like particles ( VLPs ) as an SB__RSV vaccine candidate . 
</br>
Reverse genetics generation of chimeric infectious Junin / Lassa <b>virus</b> is dependent on interaction of homologous glycoprotein stable signal peptide and G2 cytoplasmic domains . 
</br>
In an effort to improve upon the existing live attenuated SB__JUNV Candid1 vaccine , we generated a genetically homogenous stock of this <b>virus</b> from cDNA copies of the <b>virus</b> S and L segments by using a reverse genetics system . 
</br>
Here we examined the role of B7 costimulatory ligands in establishing immune detente from both the host and <b>virus</b> perspectives . 
</br>
SB__Mice lacking both B7 . 1 and B7 . 2 showed reduced early expansion of CMV - specific CD4 T cells , consequently allowing for enhanced levels of persistent <b>virus</b> replication . 
</br>
Together , these data reveal a requirement for B7 - mediated signaling in regulating the CMV - specific CD4 T cell response and establishing host - <b>virus</b> equilibrium . 
</br>
Varicella - zoster <b>virus</b> ( SB__VZV ) reactivation causes herpes zoster , which is accompanied by an influx of lymphocytes into affected ganglia , but the stimulus for this infiltrate is not known . 
</br>
The immunologic mechanisms underlying the faster progression of hepatitis C <b>virus</b> ( SB__HCV ) disease in the presence of SB__human SI__immunodeficiency SI__virus ( SB__HIV ) coinfection are not clearly understood . 
</br>
T - cell cross - reactivity between SB__HCV and influenza <b>virus</b> - specific epitopes has been associated with rapid progression of SB__HCV disease ( S . Urbani , B . Amadei , P . Fisicaro , M . Pilli , G . Missale , A . Bertoletti , and C . Ferrari , J . Exp . Med . 201 : 675 - 680 , 2005 ) . 
</br>
However , the induction of cross - reactive T cells may not be associated with control of disease caused by the heterologous <b>virus</b> . 
</br>
To explore the protection mechanisms in vivo , we primed mice with SB__H1 and SB__H3 SI__influenza SI__virus isolates and rechallenged them with a <b>virus</b> derived from the SB__2009 SI__H1N1 SI__A SI__/ SI__CA SI__/ SI__04 SI__/ SI__09 SI__virus , named CA / E3 / 09 . 
</br>
We found that priming with influenza viruses of both SB__H1 and H3 homo - and heterosubtypes protected against lethal CA / E3 / 09 <b>virus</b> challenge . 
</br>
In India , there has been co - circulation , extinction and emergence of genotypes / lineages within serotype A foot - and - mouth disease ( SB__FMD ) <b>virus</b> . 
</br>
Systemic <b>virus</b> - induced gene silencing allows functional characterization of SB__maize genes during biotrophic interaction with SB__Ustilago SI__maydis . 
</br>
To identify SB__maize genes that are functionally involved in the interaction with SB__U SI__. SI__maydis , we adapted a <b>virus</b> - induced gene silencing ( VIGS ) system based on the brome mosaic <b>virus</b> ( BMV ) for SB__maize . 
</br>
Complement opsonization enhances friend <b>virus</b> infection of B cells and thereby amplifies the <b>virus</b> - specific CD8 + T cell response . 
</br>
B cells are one of the targets of Friend <b>virus</b> ( FV ) infection , a well - established mouse model often used to study SB__retroviral infections in vivo . 
</br>
Plasma membrane Ca ^ 2 + transporters mediate <b>virus</b> - induced acquired resistance to oxidative stress . 
</br>
In order to facilitate the identification of proteins that may interact with SB__MMV either by facilitating acquisition or responding to <b>virus</b> infection , we generated and analysed the gut transcriptome of SB__P SI__. SI__maidis . 
</br>
Little is known about endosomal pathway proteins involved in arthropod - borne <b>virus</b> ( arbovirus ) assembly and cell - to - cell spread in vector mosquitoes . 
</br>
Transient gene silencing of SV2 or UNC93A in mosquitoes infected with the recombinant alphavirus SB__Sindbis MRE16 - enhanced green fluorescent protein ( SB__SINV ; family Togaviridae ) resulted in the accumulation of viral positive - and negative - strand RNA , congregation of <b>virus</b> envelope antigen in intracellular networks , and reduced <b>virus</b> dissemination outside of the midgut . 
</br>
Together , these data support a role for UNC93A and SV2 in <b>virus</b> assembly or budding . 
</br>
SB__Hepatitis SI__delta SI__virus ( SB__HDV ) is a small , defective RNA <b>virus</b> that can infect only individuals who have SB__hepatitis SI__B SI__virus ( SB__HBV ) ; worldwide more than 15 million people are co - infected . 
</br>
Through curing <b>virus</b> - infected SB__A SI__. SI__fumigatus isolates by cycloheximide treatment and transfecting <b>virus</b> - free isolates with purified <b>virus</b> , as checked by RT - PCR , isogenic <b>virus</b> - free and <b>virus</b> - infected lines of the fungus were generated whose phenotypes and growth have been directly compared . 
</br>
This multiplex assay will allow laboratories to screen respiratory samples for all types of SB__influenza SI__A , SB__influenza SI__A SI__H1N1 ( 2009 ) <b>virus</b> and oseltamivir resistant ( H275Y ) SB__influenza SI__A SI__H1N1 ( 2009 ) <b>virus</b> in a rapid and cost effective format , ensuring that typing methods for seasonal and avian viruses are used on a smaller subset of samples . 
</br>
Small - molecule inhibition of SB__human SI__immunodeficiency SI__virus SI__type SI__1 infection by <b>virus</b> capsid destabilization . 
</br>
A single point mutation in CA that stabilizes the SB__HIV SI__- SI__1 core also conferred strong resistance to the <b>virus</b> without inhibiting compound binding . 
</br>
The 2009 SB__H1N1 pandemic was caused by the emergence of a reassortant SB__H1N1 subtype ( SB__H1N1pdm ) SB__influenza SI__A SI__virus containing gene segments that originally circulated in SB__human , avian , and SB__swine <b>virus</b> reservoirs . 
</br>
Results from mini - genome replication assays in SB__human cells and <b>virus</b> titration in SB__mouse tissues demonstrated that PB2 - E158G is a pathogenic determinant , because it significantly increases viral replication rates . 
</br>
The <b>virus</b> load in PB2 - E158G - infected SB__mouse lungs was 1 , 300 - fold higher than that of the wild - type <b>virus</b> . 
</br>
SB__Hepatitis SI__C SI__virus NS2 protein serves as a scaffold for <b>virus</b> assembly by interacting with both structural and nonstructural proteins . 
</br>
To characterize the role of NS2 in the production of infectious <b>virus</b> , we determined NS2 interaction partners among other SB__HCV proteins during productive infection . 
</br>
Among mutations in p7 , NS2 , and NS3 that prevent production of infectious <b>virus</b> , only p7 mutations significantly reduced NS2 - mediated protein interactions . 
</br>
These results suggest that NS2 acts to coordinate <b>virus</b> assembly by mediating interactions between envelope proteins and NS3 and NS5A within replication complexes adjacent to lipid droplets , where <b>virus</b> particle assembly is thought to occur . 
</br>
The utility of a new instrument for rapid <b>virus</b> quantitation , the Virus Counter , was evaluated in a blind study conducted at three sites . 
</br>
Non - structural protein 1 ( NS1 ) antibody - based assays to differentiate SB__West SI__Nile ( WN ) <b>virus</b> from Japanese encephalitis <b>virus</b> infections in horses : effects of SB__WN SI__virus NS1 antibodies induced by inactivated WN vaccine . 
</br>
Antibodies to non - structural protein 1 ( NS1 ) of West Nile <b>virus</b> ( WNV ) have been used to differentiate WNV infection from infection by serologically cross - reactive flaviviruses , including SB__Japanese SI__encephalitis SI__virus ( JEV ) , in horses . 
</br>
However , characterization of this response against autologous <b>virus</b> at the monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) level has only recently begun to be elucidated . 
</br>
Additionally , the escape mutation R189S in V2 , which conferred resistance against all three MAbs , had no detrimental effect on <b>virus</b> replication in vitro . 
</br>
ORFV002 expression in cell cultures significantly decreased wild - type - <b>virus</b> - , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - alpha ) - , and lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - induced NF - kappaB - mediated gene expression . 
</br>
Expression of ORFV002 in cells , while not affecting phosphorylation or nuclear translocation of NF - kappaB - p65 , markedly decreased TNF - alpha - and wild - type - <b>virus</b> - induced acetylation of NF - kappaB - p65 , a p300 - mediated nuclear modification of NF - kappaB - p65 that regulates its transactivating activity . 
</br>
Deletion of ORFV002 from the OV - IA82 genome had no significant effect on ORFV pathogenesis in sheep , indicating that ORFV002 is nonessential for <b>virus</b> virulence in the natural host . 
</br>
To test this hypothesis , mice were hyperimmunized with <b>virus</b> - like particles ( VLPs ) representing an early ( GII . 4 - 1987 ) and a contemporary ( GII . 4 - 2006 ) GII . 4 strain . 
</br>
Dominant inhibition of Akt / protein kinase B signaling by the matrix protein of a negative - strand RNA <b>virus</b> . 
</br>
Plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pDCs ) are the major producers of type 1 interferon ( IFN ) , primarily in response to <b>virus</b> infection . 
</br>
By detecting the 2A ( pro ) produced early during the <b>virus</b> infection cycle , the CFP - YFP pair effectively identifies infectious SB__coxsackievirus SI__B3 ( SB__CVB3 ) , a picornavirus that causes viral myocarditis in SB__humans . 
</br>
Interestingly , growth of a sumoylation - deficient WSN <b>virus</b> mutant was retarded compared to that of wild - type <b>virus</b> . 
</br>
Selection of a jacalin - resistant SB__SIVmac239 variant population resulted in <b>virus</b> with specific substitutions within amino acids 128 to 139 . 
</br>
In contrast , gEDeltaCys , which lacks gE / gI heterodimer formation , was significantly impaired at early times postinfection ; viral genome copy numbers increased slowly , and infectious <b>virus</b> production was not detected until day 28 . 
</br>
The replication of gE - AYRV , which is impaired for trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) localization , and the replication of gE - SSTT , which contains mutations in an acidic cluster , were equivalent to that of rOka , causing significant cytopathic effects and infectious <b>virus</b> production by day 14 ; genome copy numbers were equivalent to those of rOka . 
</br>
Viral inhibition among three different types of <b>virus</b> by transgenic 3D ( pol ) suggests that the mechanism of action is not the direct interference with picornaviral 3D ( pol ) but instead may be the changing of host cells to an antiviral state before or after viral infection occurs , as basal interferon levels were higher in 3D ( pol ) transgenic SB__mice before infection . 
</br>
Here , we demonstrate that the increase in translation factor concentration was readily detected in an asynchronous population of SB__HCMV - infected primary SB__human fibroblasts , abolished by prior UV inactivation of <b>virus</b> , and genetically dependent upon viral immediate - early genes . 
</br>
While <b>virus</b> - induced PABP accumulation did not require p70 S6K , it was inhibited by the expression of a dominant - acting 4E - BP1 variant unable to be inactivated by mTORC1 . 
</br>
Here , we have used anew humanized SB__mouse model , in which both SB__human fetal CD34 ( + ) hematopoietic stemcells and thymus / liver tissue are transplanted , to compare SB__EBV pathogenesis andlymphoma formation following infection with a lytic replication - defectiveBZLF1 - deleted ( Z - KO ) <b>virus</b> or a lytically active BZLF1 ( + ) control . 
</br>
Animalsinfected with the control <b>virus</b> developed tumors more frequently than Z - KOvirus - infected animals . 
</br>
Specific immune responses against SB__EBV - infected B cellswere generated in SB__mice infected with either the control <b>virus</b> or the Z - KOvirus . 
</br>
This <b>virus</b> was used to assess the relevance of P and V interactions with STAT1 for virulence in primates . 
</br>
The STAT1 - blind <b>virus</b> less efficiently controlled the inflammatory response , as measured by enhanced transcription of interleukin - 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from infected hosts . 
</br>
Importantly , neutralizing antibody titers and SB__MV - specific T - cell responses were equivalent in hosts infected with either <b>virus</b> . 
</br>
These findings indicate that efficient SB__MV interactions with STAT1 are required to sustain virulence in a natural host by controlling the inflammatory response against the <b>virus</b> . 
</br>
RNA aptamers directed to SB__human SI__immunodeficiency SI__virus SI__type SI__1 Gag polyprotein bind to the matrix and nucleocapsid domains and inhibit <b>virus</b> production .
