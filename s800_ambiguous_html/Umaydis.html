<h2>U. maydis</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21039559</h3>Systemic virus-induced gene silencing allows functional characterization of <span class="annotated ">maize</span> genes during biotrophic interaction with <span class="annotated ">Ustilago maydis</span>. <br><br>Infection of <span class="annotated ">maize</span> (<span class="annotated ">Zea mays</span>) plants with the <span class="annotated ">corn</span> smut fungus <span class="annotated ">Ustilago maydis</span> leads to the formation of large tumors on the stem, leaves and inflorescences. In this biotrophic interaction, plant defense responses are actively suppressed by the pathogen, and previous transcriptome analyses of infected <span class="annotated ">maize</span> plants showed massive and stage-specific changes in host gene expression during disease progression. To identify <span class="annotated ">maize</span> genes that are functionally involved in the interaction with <span class="match annotated ">U. maydis</span>, we adapted a virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) system based on the brome mosaic <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> (BMV) for <span class="annotated ">maize</span>. Conditions were established that allowed successful <span class="match annotated ">U. maydis</span> infection of BMV-preinfected <span class="unannotated ">maize</span> plants. This set-up enabled quantification of VIGS and its impact on <span class="match annotated ">U. maydis</span> infection using a quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)-based readout. In proof-of-principle experiments, an <span class="match annotated ">U. maydis</span>-induced terpene synthase was shown to negatively regulate disease development while a protein involved in cell death inhibition was required for full virulence of <span class="match unannotated ">U. maydis</span>. The results suggest that this system is a versatile tool for the rapid identification of <span class="annotated ">maize</span> genes that determine compatibility with <span class="match annotated ">U. maydis</span>. 
<h3>21073977</h3>Cleavage of resveratrol in fungi: characterization of the enzyme Rco1 from <span class="annotated ">Ustilago maydis</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Ustilago maydis</span>, the causative agent of <span class="annotated ">corn smut</span> disease, contains two genes encoding members of the carotenoid cleavage oxygenase family, a group of enzymes that cleave double bonds in different substrates. One of them, Cco1, was formerly identified as a Beta-carotene cleaving enzyme. Here we elucidate the function of the protein encoded by the second gene, termed here as <span class="annotated ">Ustilago maydis</span> Resveratrol cleavage oxygenase 1 (Um Rco1). In vitro incubations of heterologously expressed and purified UM Rco1 with different carotenoid and stilbene substrates demonstrate that it cleaves the interphenyl Calpha-CBeta double bond of the phytoalexin resveratrol and its derivative piceatannol. Um Rco1 exhibits a high degree of substrate specificity, as suggested by the lack of activity on carotenoids and the other resveratrol-related compounds tested. The activity of Um Rco1 was confirmed by incubation of <span class="match annotated ">U. maydis</span> rco1 deletion and over-expression strains with resveratrol. Furthermore, treatment with resveratrol resulted in striking alterations of cell morphology. However, pathogenicity assays indicated that Um rco1 is largely dispensable for biotrophic development. Our work reveals Um Rco1 as the first eukaryotic resveratrol cleavage enzyme identified so far. Moreover, Um Rco1 represents a subfamily of <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> enzymes likely involved in the degradation of stilbene compounds, as suggested by the cleavage of resveratrol by homologs from <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus fumigatus</span>, <span class="annotated ">Chaetomium globosum</span> and <span class="annotated ">Botryotinia fuckeliana</span>.
