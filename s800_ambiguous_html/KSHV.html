<h2>KSHV</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20980519</h3>Activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells by <span class="yellow">Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus</span>. 

<span class="yellow">Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus</span> (<span class="blue">KSHV</span>) is associated with multiple <span class="yellow">human</span> malignancies, including Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman's disease. Following primary infection, <span class="blue">KSHV</span> typically goes through a brief period of lytic replication prior to the establishment of latency. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are the major producers of type 1 interferon (IFN), primarily in response to <span class="yellow">virus</span> infection. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are key components of the innate immune system, and they serve as pathogen recognition receptors that stimulate the host antiviral response. pDCs express exclusively TLR7 and TLR9, and it is through these TLRs that the type 1 interferon response is activated in pDCs. Currently, it is not known whether <span class="blue">KSHV</span> is recognized by pDCs and whether activation of pDCs occurs in response to <span class="blue">KSHV</span> infection. We now report evidence that <span class="blue">KSHV</span> can infect <span class="yellow">human</span> pDCs and that pDCs are activated upon <span class="blue">KSHV</span> infection, as measured by upregulation of CD83 and CD86 and by IFN-alpha secretion. We further show that induction of IFN-alpha occurs through activation of TLR9 signaling and that a TLR9 inhibitor diminishes the production and secretion of IFN-alpha by <span class="blue">KSHV</span>-infected pDCs.
