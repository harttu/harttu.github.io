Taking advantage of the available whole genome sequence of the oomycete plant pathogen <span class="yellow">Phytophthora sojae</span>, 35 genes encoding putative SNARE proteins were identified in the genome of this organism. PsYKT6, one of the most conserved SNARE proteins, was functionally characterized by homology-dependent gene silencing. The phenotype analysis showed that PsYKT6 is important for proper asexual development, sexual reproduction, and pathogenesis on host <span class="blue">soybean</span> cultivars.
