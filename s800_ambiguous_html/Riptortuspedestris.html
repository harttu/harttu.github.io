<h2>Riptortus pedestris</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21435062</h3>Causal involvement of mammalian-type cryptochrome in the circadian cuticle deposition rhythm in the <span class="yellow">bean bug</span> <span class="blue">Riptortus pedestris</span>. <br><br>Mammalian-type CRYPTOCHROME (CRY-m) is considered to be a core repressive component of the circadian clock in various insect species. However, this role is based only on the molecular function of CRY-m in cultured cells and it therefore remains unknown whether CRY-m is indispensable for governing physiological rhythms at the organismal level. In the present study, we show that RNA interference (RNAi) targeting of cry-m in the <span class="yellow">bean bug</span> <span class="blue">Riptortus pedestris</span> disrupts the circadian clock governing the cuticle deposition rhythm and results in the generation of a single cuticle layer. Furthermore, period expression was induced in cry-m RNAi insects. These results verified that CRY-m functions as a negative regulator in the circadian clock that generates physiological rhythm at the organismal level.
