<h2>Reston Ebola virus</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21084112</h3>Ebola haemorrhagic fever.<br><br><span class="yellow">Ebola viruses</span> are the causative agents of a severe form of <span class="yellow">viral</span> haemorrhagic fever in man, designated Ebola haemorrhagic fever, and are endemic in regions of central Africa. The exception is the species <span class="blue">Reston Ebola virus</span>, which has not been associated with <span class="yellow">human</span> disease and is found in the Philippines. <span class="yellow">Ebola virus</span> constitutes an important local public health threat in Africa, with a worldwide effect through imported infections and through the fear of misuse for biological terrorism. <span class="yellow">Ebola virus</span> is thought to also have a detrimental effect on the great ape population in Africa. Case-fatality rates of the African species in man are as high as 90%, with no prophylaxis or treatment available. <span class="yellow">Ebola virus</span> infections are characterised by immune suppression and a systemic inflammatory response that causes impairment of the vascular, coagulation, and immune systems, leading to multiorgan failure and shock, and thus, in some ways, resembling septic shock.
