</br>
Our results establish the potential to utilize hESC - and iPSC - derived NK cells to better understand anti - SB__HIV SI__- SI__1 immunity and provide a novel cellular immunotherapeutic approach to treat <b>HIV</b> / AIDS . 
</br>
The <b>HIV</b> envelope ( Env ) protein uses a dense coat of glycans to mask conserved domains and evade host humoral immune responses . 
</br>
The broadly neutralizing antibody 2G12 , which binds a specific cluster of high - mannose glycans on <b>HIV</b> Env , shows that the glycan shield can also serve as a target for neutralizing antibodies . 
</br>
Combined , these data show that the triple mutant SB__yeast strain elicits antibodies that bind to high - mannose glycans presented on the <b>HIV</b> envelope , but only when they are displayed in a manner not found on native Env trimers . 
</br>
Characterization of cross - reactive CD8 + T - cell recognition of HLA - A2 - restricted <b>HIV</b> - Gag ( SLYNTVATL ) and HCV - NS5b ( ALYDVVSKL ) epitopes in individuals infected with SB__human SI__immunodeficiency and SB__hepatitis SI__C SI__viruses . 
</br>
Our search for amino acid sequence homology between the HCV and SB__HIV proteomes revealed two similar HLA - A2 - restricted epitopes , <b>HIV</b> - Gag ( SLYNTVATL [ <b>HIV</b> - SL9 ] ) and SB__HCV - NS5b ( ALYDVVSKL [ SB__HCV - AL9 ] ) . 
</br>
Thus , we find that <b>HIV</b> infection induces T cells that can cross - react to heterologous viruses or prime for T cells that are closely related in sequence . 
</br>
This demonstrates that degeneracy of <b>HIV</b> - specific T cells may play a role in the immunopathology of SB__HCV / SB__HIV coinfection .

As with SB__influenza SI__virus , <b>HIV</b> , and SB__hepatitis SI__C SI__virus , norovirus antigenic variation will significantly influence the design of efficacious vaccines and immunotherapeutics against these important SB__human pathogens . 
</br>
Due to the devastating effect of <b>HIV</b> on susceptibility to tuberculosis , sub - Saharan Africa has been disproportionately affected and accounts for four of every five cases of <b>HIV</b> - associated tuberculosis . 
</br>
Increasing burden of liver disease in patients with <b>HIV</b> infection . 
</br>
Introduction of effective combined antiretroviral therapy has made <b>HIV</b> infection a chronic illness . 
</br>
Increases in non - alcoholic fatty liver disease and drug - induced hepatotoxicity , together with development of hepatocellular carcinoma , also potentiate the burden of liver disease in individuals with <b>HIV</b> infection .
