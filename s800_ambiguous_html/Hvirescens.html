<h2>H. virescens</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20946532</h3>Functional characterization of pheromone receptors in the <span class="yellow">tobacco budworm</span> <span class="yellow">Heliothis virescens</span>. 

Functional analyses of candidate <span class="yellow">Heliothis virescens</span> pheromone odorant receptors (HvORs) were conducted using heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes. HvOR6 was found to be highly tuned to Z9-14:Ald, while HvOR13, HvOR14 and HvOR16 showed specificity for Z11-16:Ald, Z11-16:OAc and Z11-16:OH, respectively. HvOR15, which had been considered a candidate receptor for Z9-14:Ald did not respond to any of the pheromone compounds tested, nor to 50 other general odorants. Thus, while HvOR15 is specifically expressed in <span class="blue">H. virescens</span> male antennae, its role in pheromone reception remains unknown. Based on our results and previous research we can now assign pheromone receptors in <span class="blue">H. virescens</span> males to each of the critical <span class="blue">H. virescens</span> agonistic pheromone compounds and two antagonistic compounds produced by heterospecific females.
