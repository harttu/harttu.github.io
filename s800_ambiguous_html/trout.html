</br>
Field observations demonstrated higher infection intensity in introduced <b>trout</b> than in SB__native SI__galaxias , but only small , immature A . galaxii were present in SB__trout . 
</br>
They show that increasing ice cover correlates with lower <b>trout</b> biomass when SB__Arctic SI__charr co - occur , but not in SB__charr SI__' SI__s absence . 
</br>
Decreasing ice cover with warmer winters could mean more <b>trout</b> and fewer SB__charr .
