<h2>Human respiratory syncytial virus</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20980510</h3>Assembly and immunological properties of <span class="yellow">Newcastle disease virus</span>-like particles containing the <span class="yellow">respiratory syncytial virus</span> F and G proteins. 

<span class="blue">Human respiratory syncytial virus</span> (<span class="yellow">RSV</span>) is a serious respiratory pathogen in infants and young children as well as elderly and immunocompromised populations. However, no <span class="yellow">RSV</span> vaccines are available. We have explored the potential of virus-like particles (VLPs) as an <span class="yellow">RSV</span> vaccine candidate. VLPs composed entirely of <span class="yellow">RSV</span> proteins were produced at levels inadequate for their preparation as immunogens. However, VLPs composed of the <span class="yellow">Newcastle disease virus</span> (<span class="yellow">NDV</span>) nucleocapsid and membrane proteins and chimera proteins containing the ectodomains of <span class="yellow">RSV</span> F and G proteins fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of <span class="yellow">NDV</span> F and HN proteins, respectively, were quantitatively prepared from avian cells. Immunization of <span class="yellow">mice</span> with these VLPs, without adjuvant, stimulated robust, anti-<span class="yellow">RSV</span> F and G protein antibody responses. IgG2a/IgG1 ratios were very high, suggesting predominantly T(H)1 responses. In contrast to infectious <span class="yellow">RSV</span> immunization, neutralization antibody titers were robust and stable for 4 months. Immunization with a single dose of VLPs resulted in the complete protection of <span class="yellow">mice</span> from <span class="yellow">RSV</span> replication in lungs. Upon <span class="yellow">RSV</span> intranasal challenge of VLP-immunized <span class="yellow">mice</span>, no enhanced lung pathology was observed, in contrast to the pathology observed in <span class="yellow">mice</span> immunized with formalin-inactivated <span class="yellow">RSV</span>. These results suggest that these VLPs are effective <span class="yellow">RSV</span> vaccines in <span class="yellow">mice</span>, in contrast to other nonreplicating <span class="yellow">RSV</span> vaccine candidates.
