SI__campestris is an epiphytic bacterium that can become a vascular pathogen responsible for <b>black</b> rot disease of crucifers . 
</br>
The presence of a tumour ( usually an ovarian teratoma ) is dependent on age , sex , and ethnicity , being more frequent in women older than 18 years , and slightly more predominant in <b>black</b> women than it is in white women . 
</br>
A characteristic hallmark of SB__Aspergillus SI__niger is the formation of <b>black</b> conidiospores . 
</br>
Identification and characterization of putative osmosensors , HwSho1A and HwSho1B , from the extremely halotolerant <b>black</b> yeast SB__Hortaea SI__werneckii . 
</br>
Two novel SHO1 - like genes , HwSHO1A and HwSHO1B , have been cloned from the saltern - inhabiting , extremely halotolerant <b>black</b> yeast SB__Hortaea SI__werneckii . 
</br>
Ethnically the highest incidence was among <b>black</b> people , with 17 cases . 
</br>
Trials in 2005 with sticky traps of different colors showed that significantly more alate SB__E SI__. SI__abietinum were caught on yellow , red , and green sticky traps than on white , blue , and <b>black</b> traps .
