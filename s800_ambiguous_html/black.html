<span class="yellow">Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris</span> is an epiphytic bacterium that can become a vascular pathogen responsible for <span class="red">black</span> rot disease of crucifers. To adapt gene expression in response to ever-changing habitats, phytopathogenic bacteria have evolved signal transduction regulatory pathways, such as extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors. The alternative sigma factor sigma(E), encoded by rpoE, is crucial for envelope stress response and plays a role in the pathogenicity of many bacterial species. Here, we combine different approaches to investigate the role and mechanism of sigma(E)-dependent activation in <span class="yellow">X. campestris pv. campestris</span>. We show that the rpoE gene is organized as a single transcription unit with the anti-sigma gene rseA and the protease gene mucD and that rpoE transcription is autoregulated. rseA and mucD transcription is also controlled by a highly conserved sigma(E)-dependent promoter within the sigma(E) gene sequence. The sigma(E)-mediated stress response is required for stationary-phase survival, resistance to cadmium, and adaptation to membrane-perturbing stresses (elevated temperature and ethanol). Using microarray technology, we started to define the sigma(E) regulon of <span class="yellow">X. campestris pv. campestris</span>. These genes encode proteins belonging to different classes, including periplasmic or membrane proteins, biosynthetic enzymes, classical heat shock proteins, and the heat stress sigma factor sigma(H). The consensus sequence for the predicted sigma(E)-regulated promoter elements is GGAACTN(15-17)GTCNNA. Determination of the rpoH transcription start site revealed that rpoH was directly regulated by sigma(E) under both normal and heat stress conditions. Finally, sigma(E) activity is regulated by the putative regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) proteases RseP and DegS, as previously described in many other bacteria. However, our data suggest that RseP and DegS are not only dedicated to RseA cleavage and that the proteolytic cascade of RseA could involve other proteases. 
<h3>21163445</h3>Clinical experience and laboratory investigations in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. 

Since its discovery in 2007, the encephalitis associated with antibodies against the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) has entered the mainstream of neurology and other disciplines. Most patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis develop a multistage illness that progresses from psychosis, memory deficits, seizures, and language disintegration into a state of unresponsiveness with catatonic features often associated with abnormal movements, and autonomic and breathing instability. The disorder predominantly affects children and young adults, occurs with or without tumour association, and responds to treatment but can relapse. The presence of a tumour (usually an ovarian teratoma) is dependent on age, sex, and ethnicity, being more frequent in women older than 18 years, and slightly more predominant in <span class="red">black</span> women than it is in white women. Patients treated with tumour resection and immunotherapy (corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, or plasma exchange) respond faster to treatment and less frequently need second-line immunotherapy (cyclophosphamide or rituximab, or both) than do patients without a tumour who receive similar initial immunotherapy. More than 75% of all patients have substantial recovery that occurs in inverse order of symptom development and is associated with a decline of antibody titres. Patients' antibodies cause a titre-dependent, reversible decrease of synaptic NMDAR by a mechanism of crosslinking and internalisation. On the basis of models of pharmacological or genetic disruption of NMDAR, these antibody effects reveal a probable pathogenic relation between the depletion of receptors and the clinical features of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. 
<h3>21277986</h3>The molecular and genetic basis of conidial pigmentation in <span class="yellow">Aspergillus niger</span>.

A characteristic hallmark of <span class="yellow">Aspergillus niger</span> is the formation of <span class="red">black</span> conidiospores. We have identified four loci involved in spore pigmentation of <span class="yellow">A. niger</span> by using a combined genomic and classical complementation approach. First, we characterized a newly isolated color mutant, colA, which lacked pigmentation resulting in white or colorless conidia. Pigmentation of the colA mutant was restored by a gene (An12g03950) which encodes a putative 4'phosphopantetheinyl transferase protein (PptA). 4'Phosphopantetheinyl transferase activity is required for the activation of Polyketide Synthases (PKSs) and/or Non-Ribosomal Peptide Synthases (NRPSs). The loci whose mutation resulted in fawn, olive, and brown color phenotypes were identified by complementation. The fawn phenotype was complemented by a PKS protein (FwnA, An09g05730), the ovlA mutant by An14g05350 (OlvA) and the brnA mutant by An14g05370 (BrnA), the respective homologs of alb1/pksP, ayg1 and abr1 in <span class="yellow">A. fumigatus</span>. Targeted disruption of the pptA, fwnA, olvA and brnA genes confirmed the complementation results. Disruption of the pptA gene abolished synthesis of all polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides, while the naphtho-gamma-pyrone subclass of polyketides were specifically dependent on fwnA, and funalenone on fwnA, olvA and brnA. Thus, secondary metabolite profiling of the color mutants revealed a close relationship between polyketide synthesis and conidial pigmentation in <span class="yellow">A. niger</span>. 
<h3>21281727</h3>Identification and characterization of putative osmosensors, HwSho1A and HwSho1B, from the extremely halotolerant <span class="red">black</span> <span class="yellow">yeast</span> <span class="yellow">Hortaea werneckii</span>. 

In <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, the Sho1 protein is one of two potential osmosensors that can activate the kinase cascade of the HOG pathway in response to increased extracellular osmolarity. Two novel SHO1-like genes, HwSHO1A and HwSHO1B, have been cloned from the saltern-inhabiting, extremely halotolerant <span class="red">black</span> <span class="yellow">yeast</span> <span class="yellow">Hortaea werneckii</span>. The HwSho1 protein isoforms are 93.8% identical in their amino-acid sequences, and have a conserved SH3 domain. When the HwSHO1 genes were transferred into <span class="yellow">S. cerevisae</span> cells lacking the SHO1 gene, both of the HwSho1 isoforms fully complemented the function of the native <span class="yellow">S. cerevisiae</span> Sho1 protein. Through microscopic and biochemical validation, we demonstrate that in <span class="yellow">S. cerevisiae</span>, both of the HwSho1 proteins have characteristic subcellular localizations similar to the <span class="yellow">S. cerevisiae</span> Sho1 protein, and they can both activate the HOG pathway under conditions of osmotic stress. To a lower extent, crosstalk to the mating pathway expressing HwSho1 proteins is conserved in the PBS2 deleted <span class="yellow">S. cerevisiae</span> strain. These data show that the HwSho1 proteins from <span class="yellow">H. werneckii</span> are true functional homologs of the Sho1 protein of <span class="yellow">S. cerevisiae</span>. 
<h3>21526930</h3>Fire ant decapitating fly cooperative release programs (1994-2008): two Pseudacteon species, <span class="yellow">P. tricuspis</span> and <span class="yellow">P. curvatus</span>, rapidly expand across imported <span class="yellow">fire ant</span> populations in the southeastern United States. 

Natural enemies of the imported <span class="yellow">fire ants</span>, <span class="yellow">Solenopsis invicta Buren</span> <span class="yellow">S. richteri Forel</span> (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), and their hybrid, include a suite of more than 20 <span class="yellow">fire ant</span> decapitating phorid flies from South America in the genus Pseudacteon. Over the past 12 years, many researchers and associates have cooperated in introducing several species as classical or self-sustaining biological control agents in the United States. As a result, two species of flies, <span class="yellow">Pseudacteon tricuspis Borgmeier</span> and <span class="yellow">P. curvatus Borgmeier</span> (Diptera: Phoridae), are well established across large areas of the southeastern United States. Whereas many researchers have published local and state information about the establishment and spread of these flies, here distribution data from both published and unpublished sources has been compiled for the entire United States with the goal of presenting confirmed and probable distributions as of the fall of 2008. Documented rates of expansion were also used to predict the distribution of these flies three years later in the fall of 2011. In the fall of 2008, eleven years after the first successful release, we estimate that <span class="yellow">P. tricuspis</span> covered about 50% of the <span class="yellow">fire ant</span> quarantined area and that it will occur in almost 65% of the quarantine area by 2011. Complete coverage of the <span class="yellow">fire ant</span> quarantined area will be delayed or limited by this species' slow rate of spread and frequent failure to establish in more northerly portions of the <span class="yellow">fire ant</span> range and also, perhaps, by its preference for <span class="yellow">red imported fire ants</span> (<span class="yellow">S. invicta</span>). Eight years after the first successful release of <span class="yellow">P. curvatus</span>, two biotypes of this species (one biotype occurring predominantly in the <span class="blue">black</span> and hybrid imported <span class="yellow">fire ants</span> and the other occurring in <span class="yellow">red imported fire ants</span>) covered almost 60% of the <span class="yellow">fire ant</span> quarantined area. We estimate these two biotypes will cover almost 90% of the quarantine area by 2011 and 100% by 2012 or 2013. Strategic selection of several distributional gaps for future releases will accelerate complete coverage of quarantine areas. However, some gaps may be best used for the release of additional species of decapitating flies because establishment rates may be higher in areas without competing species. 
<h3>21526934</h3>Factors of susceptibility of <span class="yellow">human</span> myiasis caused by the <span class="yellow">New World screw-worm</span>, <span class="yellow">Cochliomyia hominivorax</span> in Sao Gonsigmaalo, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 

This study was carried out between July 2007 and June 2008 and reports on the occurrence of <span class="yellow">human</span> myiasis caused by the New World screwworm, <span class="yellow">Cochliomyia hominivorax</span> (Coquerel) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) in Sao Gonsigmaalo in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Liquid or solid vaseline was used to suffocate the larvae, which were then preserved in 70% ethanol and sent to the Instituto Oswaldo Cruz for identification. <span class="yellow">C. hominivorax</span> were identified in all 22 cases of myiasis. There were 12 male and 10 female patients with ages ranging from 03 to 71. Ethnically the highest incidence was among <span class="red">black</span> people, with 17 cases. Open wounds were the main cause of the parasitosis, whereas poor personal hygiene, the low educational level, alcoholism, bedridden patients, and physical or mental disability were possibly secondary factors; in addition to all these factors the income of the patients was very low. 
<h3>22182620</h3>Influence of Sticky Trap Color and Height Above Ground on Capture of Alate <span class="yellow">Elatobium abietinum</span> (Hemiptera: Aphididae) in Sitka Spruce Plantations. 

A series of field trials were used to assess the practicality of using sticky traps to monitor populations of green spruce aphid, <span class="yellow">Elatobium abietinum</span> (Walker), in plantations of <span class="yellow">Sitka spruce</span>. The highest numbers of alate <span class="yellow">E. abietinum</span> were caught on sticky traps placed in the upper third of the live canopy at 9-17 m above the ground, whereas low numbers of aphids were caught just below the live canopy or at 2 m above the ground. Trials in 2005 with sticky traps of different colors showed that significantly more alate <span class="yellow">E. abietinum</span> were caught on yellow, red, and green sticky traps than on white, blue, and <span class="red">black</span> traps. <span class="yellow">A</span> repeat trial in 2007 resulted in significantly more alate aphids being caught on red sticky traps than on traps of any other color except for green. Attraction to red is unusual among aphids, as aphids are thought not to possess a red-sensitive photoreceptor. The attraction of <span class="yellow">E. abietinum</span> to red-colored sticky traps suggests that conifer-feeding aphids might have a fundamentally different color response compared with aphids that live on cereals, grasses, or herbaceous plants. Alternatively, the attraction to red might be a physiological artifact related to the presence of red-screening pigments in the aphid's compound eye.
