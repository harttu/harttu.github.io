<h2>anti-HCV</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20962076</h3>Neutralizing antibody-resistant <span class="annotated ">hepatitis C virus</span> cell-to-cell transmission.<br><br>Hepatitis C <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">HCV</span>) can initiate infection by cell-free particle and cell-cell contact-dependent transmission. In this study we use a novel infectious coculture system to examine these alternative modes of infection. Cell-to-cell transmission is relatively resistant to <span class="match annotated ">anti-HCV</span> glycoprotein monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal immunoglobulin isolated from infected individuals, providing an effective strategy for escaping host humoral immune responses. Chimeric viruses expressing the structural proteins representing the seven major <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> genotypes demonstrate neutralizing antibody-resistant cell-to-cell transmission. <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> entry is a multistep process involving numerous receptors. In this study we demonstrate that, in contrast to earlier reports, CD81 and the tight-junction components claudin-1 and occludin are all essential for both cell-free and cell-to-cell <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> transmission. However, scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) has a more prominent role in cell-to-cell transmission of the <span class="unannotated ">virus</span>, with SR-BI-specific antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors showing preferential inhibition of this infection route. These observations highlight the importance of targeting host cell receptors, in particular SR-BI, to control <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> infection and spread in the liver.
