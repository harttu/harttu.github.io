<h2>anti-HCV</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20962076</h3>Neutralizing antibody-resistant <span class="yellow">hepatitis C virus</span> cell-to-cell transmission.<br><br>Hepatitis C <span class="yellow">virus</span> (<span class="yellow">HCV</span>) can initiate infection by cell-free particle and cell-cell contact-dependent transmission. In this study we use a novel infectious coculture system to examine these alternative modes of infection. Cell-to-cell transmission is relatively resistant to <span class="blue">anti-HCV</span> glycoprotein monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal immunoglobulin isolated from infected individuals, providing an effective strategy for escaping host humoral immune responses. Chimeric viruses expressing the structural proteins representing the seven major <span class="yellow">HCV</span> genotypes demonstrate neutralizing antibody-resistant cell-to-cell transmission. <span class="yellow">HCV</span> entry is a multistep process involving numerous receptors. In this study we demonstrate that, in contrast to earlier reports, CD81 and the tight-junction components claudin-1 and occludin are all essential for both cell-free and cell-to-cell <span class="yellow">viral</span> transmission. However, scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) has a more prominent role in cell-to-cell transmission of the <span class="yellow">virus</span>, with SR-BI-specific antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors showing preferential inhibition of this infection route. These observations highlight the importance of targeting host cell receptors, in particular SR-BI, to control <span class="yellow">viral</span> infection and spread in the liver. 
<h3>21034775</h3>Cross-genotypic polyclonal <span class="red">anti-HCV</span><span class="yellow">HCV</span> antibodies from <span class="yellow">human</span> ascitic fluid.<br><br>Many <span class="red">anti-HCV</span><span class="yellow">HCV</span> antibodies are available, but more are needed for research and clinical applications. This study examines whether ascitic fluid from cirrhotic patients could be a source of reagent-grade antibodies. Ascitic fluid from 29 <span class="yellow">HCV</span> patients was screened by ELISA for <span class="red">anti-HCV</span><span class="yellow">HCV</span> antibodies against three <span class="yellow">viral</span> proteins: core, NS4B, and NS5A. Significant patient-to-patient variability in <span class="red">anti-HCV</span><span class="yellow">HCV</span> antibody titers was observed. Total ascitic fluid IgG purified by Protein-A chromatography reacted with <span class="yellow">HCV</span> proteins in immunoblots, cell extracts, and replicon-expressing cells. Affinity-purification using synthetic peptides as bait allowed the preparation of cross-genotypic antibodies directed against pre-selected regions of <span class="yellow">HCV</span> core, NS4B, and NS5A proteins. The performance of the polyclonal antibodies was comparable to that of monoclonal antibodies. Anti-NS4B antibody preparations reacted with genotype 1a, 1b, and 2a NS4B proteins in immunoblots and allowed NS4B to be localized in replicon-expressing cells. Ascitic fluid is an abundant source of <span class="yellow">human</span> polyclonal cross-genotypic antibodies that can be used as an alternative to blood. This study shows the utility of selectively purifying <span class="yellow">human</span> polyclonal antibodies from ascitic fluid. Affinity purification allows antibodies to be selected that are comparable to monoclonal antibodies in their ability to react with targeted regions of <span class="yellow">viral</span> proteins.
