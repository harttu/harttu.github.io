Here we tested long - term nonprogressors ' ( LTNPs ' ) susceptibility to superinfection using SB__Indian SI__rhesus SI__macaques that express the major histocompatibility complex <b>class I</b> ( MHC - I ) allele Mamu - B 17 , which is associated with control of the pathogenic AIDS SB__virus SI__SIVmac239 . 
</br>
Promoter discrimination at <b>class I</b> MarA regulon promoters mediated by glutamic acid 89 of the MarA transcriptional activator of SB__Escherichia SI__coli . 
</br>
Replacement of the MarA glutamic acid residue 89 with alanine greatly increased the marbox binding and activation of many <b>class I</b> promoters . 
</br>
Increased binding and activation occurred only at <b>class I</b> promoters when the 12th base of the promoter ' s marbox ( a position at which there is no known interaction between the marbox and MarA ) was not a T residue .
