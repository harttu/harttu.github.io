</br>
We asked whether T - cell cross - reactivity between <b>HCV</b> and SB__HIV could exist during SB__HCV / SB__HIV coinfection and affect pathogenesis . 
</br>
Our search for amino acid sequence homology between the <b>HCV</b> and SB__HIV proteomes revealed two similar HLA - A2 - restricted epitopes , HIV - Gag ( SLYNTVATL [ HIV - SL9 ] ) and SB__HCV - NS5b ( ALYDVVSKL [ SB__HCV - AL9 ] ) . 
</br>
We found that 4 out of 20 HLA - A2 - positive ( HLA - A2 ( + ) ) SB__HIV - infected individuals had CD8 ( + ) T cells that recognized both the SB__HIV - SL9 and <b>HCV</b> - AL9 epitopes . 
</br>
Although <b>HCV</b> - monoinfected individuals in our study did not show AL9 - specific responses , we found that about half of <b>HCV</b> / SB__HIV - coinfected individuals had dual responses to both epitopes . 
</br>
Affinity - purification using synthetic peptides as bait allowed the preparation of cross - genotypic antibodies directed against pre - selected regions of <b>HCV</b> core , NS4B , and NS5A proteins .
