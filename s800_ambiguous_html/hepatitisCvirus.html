<h2>hepatitis C virus</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20962076</h3>Neutralizing antibody-resistant <span class="match annotated ">hepatitis C virus</span> cell-to-cell transmission.<br><br>Hepatitis C <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">HCV</span>) can initiate infection by cell-free particle and cell-cell contact-dependent transmission. In this study we use a novel infectious coculture system to examine these alternative modes of infection. Cell-to-cell transmission is relatively resistant to <span class="annotated ">anti-HCV</span> glycoprotein monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal immunoglobulin isolated from infected individuals, providing an effective strategy for escaping host humoral immune responses. Chimeric viruses expressing the structural proteins representing the seven major <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> genotypes demonstrate neutralizing antibody-resistant cell-to-cell transmission. <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> entry is a multistep process involving numerous receptors. In this study we demonstrate that, in contrast to earlier reports, CD81 and the tight-junction components claudin-1 and occludin are all essential for both cell-free and cell-to-cell <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> transmission. However, scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) has a more prominent role in cell-to-cell transmission of the <span class="unannotated ">virus</span>, with SR-BI-specific antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors showing preferential inhibition of this infection route. These observations highlight the importance of targeting host cell receptors, in particular SR-BI, to control <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> infection and spread in the liver. 
<h3>20980521</h3>Characterization of cross-reactive CD8+ T-cell recognition of HLA-A2-restricted HIV-Gag (SLYNTVATL) and HCV-NS5b (ALYDVVSKL) epitopes in individuals infected with <span class="annotated ">human immunodeficiency</span> and <span class="annotated ">hepatitis C viruses</span>. <br><br>The immunologic mechanisms underlying the faster progression of <span class="match unannotated ">hepatitis C virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">HCV</span>) disease in the presence of <span class="annotated ">human immunodeficiency virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">HIV</span>) coinfection are not clearly understood. T-cell cross-reactivity between <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> and <span class="unannotated ">influenza</span> virus-specific epitopes has been associated with rapid progression of <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> disease (S. Urbani, B. Amadei, P. Fisicaro, M. Pilli, G. Missale, <span class="unannotated ">A</span>. Bertoletti, and C. Ferrari, J. Exp. Med. 201:675-680, 2005). We asked whether T-cell cross-reactivity between <span class="unannotated ">HCV</span> and <span class="annotated ">HIV</span> could exist during <span class="annotated ">HCV</span>/<span class="annotated ">HIV</span> coinfection and affect pathogenesis. Our search for amino acid sequence homology between the <span class="unannotated ">HCV</span> and <span class="annotated ">HIV</span> proteomes revealed two similar HLA-A2-restricted epitopes, HIV-Gag (SLYNTVATL [HIV-SL9]) and <span class="annotated ">HCV</span>-NS5b (ALYDVVSKL [<span class="annotated ">HCV</span>-AL9]). We found that 4 out of 20 HLA-A2-positive (HLA-A2(+)) <span class="annotated ">HIV</span>-infected individuals had CD8(+) T cells that recognized both the <span class="annotated ">HIV</span>-SL9 and HCV-AL9 epitopes. However, the AL9 epitope was generally shown to be a weak agonist. Although HCV-monoinfected individuals in our study did not show AL9-specific responses, we found that about half of HCV/<span class="annotated ">HIV</span>-coinfected individuals had dual responses to both epitopes. High dual T-cell recognition among coinfected subjects was usually due to separate T-cell populations targeting each epitope, as determined by pentamer staining. The one individual demonstrating cross-reactive T cells to both epitopes showed the most advanced degree of liver disease. In coinfected individuals, we observed a positive correlation between the magnitudes of T-cell responses to both the SL9 and the AL9 epitopes, which was also positively associated with the clinical parameter of liver damage. Thus, we find that <span class="unannotated ">HIV</span> infection induces T cells that can cross-react to heterologous viruses or prime for T cells that are closely related in sequence. However, the induction of cross-reactive T cells may not be associated with control of disease caused by the heterologous <span class="unannotated ">virus</span>. This demonstrates that degeneracy of HIV-specific T cells may play a role in the immunopathology of <span class="annotated ">HCV</span>/<span class="annotated ">HIV</span> coinfection. 
<h3>21029749</h3>Double-antigen sandwich ELISA for the detection of anti-<span class="match annotated ">hepatitis C virus</span> antibodies. <br><br>A double-antigen sandwich ELISA was developed a detection of <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> antibodies by a recombinant multi-epitope <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> antigen and a biotin-streptavidin amplification system. Three plasma specimens from 1708 individuals who were suspected previously to be <span class="annotated ">HCV</span>-positive using an <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> antibody diagnostic kit (Chuangxin, Xiamen, China) displayed negative results when using the ELISA. These results were validated by a recombinant immunoblotting assay (two were negative, and one was indeterminate). Among 889 blood specimens donated for clinical evaluation, 246 were positive and 630 were negative using the ELISA. The sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA were 98.7% and 100%, respectively. In 43 donors and 14 <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span> with chronic hepatitis C, the detectable rates for <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> IgM by both ELISA and the <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> anti-IgM detection reagents (Huimin, Shenyang, China) were 100%, and the detectable rate for <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> IgG using an indirect <span class="annotated ">HCV</span>-antibody detection kit (GWK, Beijing, China) was 98.3%. Thus, the double-antigen sandwich ELISA exhibits strong specificity and sensitivity and has been approved by the China State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA). The performance of the double-antigen sandwich ELISA was similar to the Ortho ELISA 3.0. It did not give false-negative results otherwise IgM was undetectable using an indirect <span class="annotated ">HCV</span>-antibody detection kit. This ELISA provides another method for the detection of <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> antibodies. 
<h3>20962101</h3><span class="annotated ">Hepatitis C virus</span> NS2 protein serves as a scaffold for <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> assembly by interacting with both structural and nonstructural proteins. <br><br>Many aspects of the assembly of <span class="match annotated ">hepatitis C virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">HCV</span>) remain incompletely understood. To characterize the role of NS2 in the production of infectious <span class="unannotated ">virus</span>, we determined NS2 interaction partners among other <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> proteins during productive infection. Pulldown assays showed that NS2 forms complexes with both structural and nonstructural proteins, including E1, E2, p7, NS3, and NS5A. Confocal microscopy also demonstrated that NS2 colocalizes with E1, E2, and NS5A in dot-like structures near lipid droplets. However, NS5A did not coprecipitate with E2 and interacted only weakly with NS3 in pulldown assays. Also, there was no demonstrable interaction between p7 and E2 or NS3 in such assays. Therefore, NS2 is uniquely capable of interacting with both structural and nonstructural proteins. Among mutations in p7, NS2, and NS3 that prevent production of infectious <span class="unannotated ">virus</span>, only p7 mutations significantly reduced NS2-mediated protein interactions. These p7 mutations altered the intracellular distribution of NS2 and E2 and appeared to modulate the membrane topology of the C-terminal domain of NS2. These results suggest that NS2 acts to coordinate <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> assembly by mediating interactions between envelope proteins and NS3 and NS5A within replication complexes adjacent to lipid droplets, where <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> particle assembly is thought to occur. p7 may play an accessory role by regulating NS2 membrane topology, which is important for NS2-mediated protein interactions and therefore NS2 function. 
<h3>20980508</h3>Norovirus GII.4 strain antigenic variation.<br><br>Noroviruses are the principal cause of epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide. Multiple reports have concluded that the major capsid proteins of GII.4 strains, which cause 80% of norovirus infections worldwide, are evolving rapidly, resulting in new epidemic strains. Surrogate neutralization assays using sera from outbreaks and from immunized <span class="unannotated ">mice</span> suggest that, as with <span class="annotated ">influenza virus</span>, antigenic variation maintains GII.4 persistence in the face of <span class="annotated ">human</span> population herd immunity. To test this hypothesis, <span class="unannotated ">mice</span> were hyperimmunized with virus-like particles (VLPs) representing an early (GII.4-1987) and a contemporary (GII.4-2006) GII.4 strain. Anti-GII.4-1987 IgG monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) strongly reacted with GII.4 VLPs derived between only 1987 and 2002. Ligand binding blockade was more efficient with GII.4-1987 and GII.4-1997 VLPs than with GII.4-2002. Anti-GII.4-2006 IgG MAbs recognized either a broad panel of GII.4 VLPs (1987 to 2006) or a subset of contemporary (2004 to 2006) VLPs. Most 2006 antibodies did not recognize or only poorly recognized GII.4 VLPs of 2007 or 2008, documenting rapid antigenic evolution of GII.4 capsids. Generally, 2006 MAbs blocked homotypic VLP-ligand binding but were unable to block VLPs representing strains primarily circulating during or earlier than 2002. These analyses demonstrate that both subtle and significant evolutionary change has occurred within antibody epitopes between epidemic strains, providing direct evidence that the GII.4 noroviruses are undergoing antigenic variation, likely in response to herd immunity. As with <span class="annotated ">influenza virus</span>, <span class="unannotated ">HIV</span>, and <span class="match annotated ">hepatitis C virus</span>, norovirus antigenic variation will significantly influence the design of efficacious vaccines and immunotherapeutics against these important <span class="annotated ">human</span> pathogens.
