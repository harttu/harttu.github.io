<h2>D. melanogaster</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21091811</h3>Candidate chemosensory ionotropic receptors in a Lepidoptera.<br><br>A new family of candidate chemosensory ionotropic receptors (IRs) related to ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) was recently discovered in <span class="yellow">Drosophila melanogaster</span>. Through Blast analyses of an expressed sequenced tag library prepared from male antennae of the noctuid moth <span class="yellow">Spodoptera littoralis</span>, we identified 12 unigenes encoding proteins related to <span class="blue">D. melanogaster</span> and <span class="yellow">Bombyx mori</span> IRs. Their full length sequences were obtained and the analyses of their expression patterns suggest that they were exclusively expressed or clearly enriched in chemosensory organs. The deduced protein sequences were more similar to <span class="yellow">B. mori</span> and <span class="blue">D. melanogaster</span> IRs than to iGluRs and showed considerable variations in the predicted ligand-binding domains; none have the three glutamate-interacting residues found in iGluRs, suggesting different binding specificities. Our data suggest that we identified members of the insect IR chemosensory receptor family in <span class="yellow">S. littoralis</span> and we report here the first demonstration of IR expression in Lepidoptera. 
<h3>21166911</h3>Conserved function of the Kruppel gap gene in the blowfly <span class="yellow">Lucilia sericata</span>, despite anterior shift of expression. <br><br>To determine whether expression patterns of segmentation genes found in <span class="yellow">Drosophila melanogaster</span> can be scaled to pattern larger insects, we studied the expression of the Kruppel (Kr) gene in the blowfly <span class="yellow">Lucilia sericata</span>. Compared with <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span> Kr, <span class="yellow">L. sericata</span> Kr showed an unexpected 10% shift of expression towards the anterior pole. Furthermore, expression domains not found in <span class="blue">D. melanogaster</span> were present at the blastoderm stage of <span class="yellow">L. sericata</span>. To compare Kr activity and function, we employed RNA interference-mediated gene silencing. We found Kr phenotypes in <span class="yellow">L. sericata</span> comparable with those observed in <span class="blue">D. melanogaster</span>, demonstrating that <span class="yellow">L. sericata</span> Kr functions as a gap gene as it does in <span class="yellow">Drosophila</span>. Our results show that, despite an anterior shift in expression, Kr function has remained conserved during the evolution of the blowflies.
