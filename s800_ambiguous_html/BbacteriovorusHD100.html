<h2>B. bacteriovorus HD100</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21148728</h3>Three motAB stator gene products in <span class="yellow">Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus</span> contribute to motility of a single flagellum during predatory and prey-independent growth. <br><br>The predatory bacterium <span class="yellow">Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus</span> uses flagellar motility to locate regions rich in Gram-negative prey bacteria, colliding and attaching to prey and then ceasing flagellar motility. Prey are then invaded to form a &quot;bdelloplast&quot; in a type IV pilus-dependent process, and prey contents are digested, allowing <span class="yellow">Bdellovibrio</span> growth and septation. After septation, <span class="yellow">Bdellovibrio</span> flagellar motility resumes inside the prey bdelloplast prior to its lysis and escape of <span class="yellow">Bdellovibrio</span> progeny. <span class="yellow">Bdellovibrio</span> can also grow slowly outside prey as long flagellate host-independent (HI) cells, cultured on peptone-rich media. The <span class="blue">B. bacteriovorus HD100</span> genome encodes three pairs of MotAB flagellar motor proteins, each of which could potentially form an inner membrane ion channel, interact with the FliG flagellar rotor ring, and produce flagellar rotation. In 2004, Flannagan and coworkers (R. S. Flannagan, M. <span class="yellow">A</span>. Valvano, and S. F. Koval, Microbiology 150:649-656, 2004) used antisense RNA and green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression to downregulate a single <span class="yellow">Bdellovibrio</span> motA gene and reported slowed release from the bdelloplast and altered motility of the progeny. Here we inactivated each pair of motAB genes and found that each pair contributes to motility, both predatorily, inside the bdelloplast and during HI growth; however, each pair was dispensable, and deletion of no pair abolished motility totally. Driving-ion studies with phenamil, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), and different pH and sodium conditions indicated that all Mot pairs are proton driven, although the sequence similarities of each Mot pair suggests that some may originate from halophilic species. Thus, <span class="yellow">Bdellovibrio</span> is a &quot;dedicated motorist,&quot; retaining and expressing three pairs of mot genes.
