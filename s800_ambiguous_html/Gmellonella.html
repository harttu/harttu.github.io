<h2>G. mellonella</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21907298</h3><span class="annotated ">Galleria mellonella</span> as model host for the trans-kingdom pathogen <span class="annotated ">Fusarium oxysporum</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Fusarium oxysporum</span>, the causal agent of vascular wilt disease, affects a wide range of plant species and can produce disseminated infections in <span class="annotated ">humans</span>. <span class="annotated ">F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici isolate FGSC 9935</span> causes disease both on <span class="annotated ">tomato plants</span> and immunodepressed <span class="annotated ">mice</span>, making it an ideal model for the comparative analysis of <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> virulence on plant and animal hosts. Here we tested the ability of <span class="annotated ">FGSC 9935</span> to cause disease in the <span class="annotated ">greater wax moth</span> <span class="annotated ">Galleria mellonella</span>, an invertebrate model host that is widely used for the study of microbial <span class="annotated ">human</span> pathogens. Injection of living but not of heat-killed microconidia into the hemocoel of <span class="match annotated ">G. mellonella</span> larvae resulted in dose-dependent killing both at 30^0C and at 37^0C. Fluorescence microscopy of larvae inoculated with a <span class="annotated ">F. oxysporum transformant</span> expressing GFP revealed hyphal proliferation within the hemocoel, interaction with <span class="match annotated ">G. mellonella</span> hemocytes, and colonization of the killed insects by the fungus. Fungal gene knockout mutants previously tested in the <span class="annotated ">tomato</span> and immunodepressed <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> systems displayed a good correlation in virulence between the Galleria and the <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> model. Thus, Galleria represents a useful non-vertebrate infection model for studying virulence mechanisms of <span class="annotated ">F. oxysporum</span> on animal hosts.
