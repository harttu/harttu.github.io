<h2>peach</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20951167</h3>Development of a polyprobe to detect six viroids of pome and stone fruit trees.<br><br>A simple and sensitive dot blot hybridization assay using a digoxigenin-labeled cRNA polyprobe was developed for the simultaneous detection of six viroids that infect pome and stone fruit trees. The polyprobe was constructed by cloning sequentially partial sequences of each viroid into a single vector, with run-off transcription driven by the T7 promoter. All six viroids were detectable within a dilution range of 5(-3) to 5(-4) in total nucleic acid extracts from infected trees. Individual trees were co-inoculated to create mixed infections and all four pome fruit viroids and both stone fruit viroids could be detected in pear and <span class="match annotated ">peach</span> trees, respectively, using the polyprobe. The results of the assays using the polyprobe were comparable to those using single probes. The methods were validated by testing geographically diverse isolates of viroids, as well as field samples from several collections in the US. The assay offers a rapid, reliable and cost-effective approach to the simultaneous detection of six fruit trees viroids and has the potential for routine use in quarantine, certification, and plant genebank programs where many samples are tested and distributed worldwide. 
<h3>22182610</h3>Interactions Between Extrafloral Nectaries, Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), and Other Natural Enemies Affect Biological Control of <span class="annotated ">Grapholita molesta</span> (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) on <span class="annotated ">Peach</span> (Rosales: Rosaceae). <br><br>Extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) are reported to benefit some plants when ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) use their secretions and fend off herbivores, but in some cases resulting competitive interactions may reduce biological control of specific herbivores. This research examined the interactions between ants and other natural enemies associated with the EFNs of <span class="match annotated ">peach</span> [<span class="annotated ">Prunus persica (L.) Batcsh</span>] and the implications for biological control of a key pest, the <span class="annotated ">oriental fruit moth</span> [<span class="annotated ">Grapholita molesta (Busck)</span>]. Studies using sentinel <span class="annotated ">G. molesta</span> placed on <span class="match annotated ">peach</span> trees ('Lovell' cultivar) with EFNs present and absent revealed that several natural enemy groups associated with the EFNs contribute to reductions in <span class="annotated ">G. molesta</span> eggs, larvae, and pupae in <span class="match unannotated ">peach</span> orchards. Ants on trees with EFNs antagonized the <span class="unannotated ">G. molesta</span> egg parasitoid <span class="annotated ">Trichogramma minutum (Riley)</span>, but the ants were crucial in reducing <span class="annotated ">G. molesta</span> in both the larval and pupal stages. Overall, individual trees with EFNs experienced higher ant and other (nonant) natural enemy densities and subsequent pest reductions, as compared with trees without EFNs. However, the implications of EFN-natural enemy-pest interactions to orchard-level biological control will likely depend on local <span class="annotated ">G. molesta</span> population dynamics.
