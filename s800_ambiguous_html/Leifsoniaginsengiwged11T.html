<h2>Leifsonia ginsengi wged11(T)</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20173001</h3><span class="annotated ">Amnibacterium kyonggiense gen. nov., sp. nov.</span>, a new member of the family Microbacteriaceae. <br><br>A Gram-positive, non-motile bacterium, designated <span class="annotated ">KSL51201-037(T)</span>, was isolated from Anyang stream, Republic of Korea, and was characterized using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strain <span class="annotated ">KSL51201-037(T)</span> belonged to the family Microbacteriaceae of the class Actinobacteria and exhibited 96.9 % gene sequence similarity to <span class="annotated ">Labedella gwakjiensis KSW2-17(T)</span>, 96.0 % to <span class="match annotated ">Leifsonia ginsengi wged11(T)</span> and 95.9 % to <span class="annotated ">Microterricola viridarii KV-677(T)</span>. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 72.7 mol%. Strain <span class="annotated ">KSL51201-037(T)</span> had l-2,4-diaminobutyric acid as the diagnostic cell-wall diamino acid, MK-11 and MK-12 as the major menaquinones, anteiso-C(15 : 0) (47.8 %) and iso-C(16 : 0) (24.0 %) as the major fatty acids and phosphatidylglycerol and three unknown phospholipids as the major polar lipids. On the basis of phenotypic and genotypic properties and phylogenetic distinctiveness, it is suggested that strain <span class="annotated ">KSL51201-037(T)</span> represents a novel species of a new genus in the family Microbacteriaceae for which the name <span class="annotated ">Amnibacterium kyonggiense gen. nov., sp. nov.</span> is proposed. The type strain of the type species is <span class="annotated ">KSL51201-037(T)</span> (=KEMC 51201-037(T)=JCM 16463(T)).
