<h2>RCNMV</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20980498</h3>Template recognition mechanisms by replicase proteins differ between bipartite positive-strand genomic RNAs of a plant <span class="unannotated ">virus</span>. <br><br>Recognition of RNA templates by <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> replicase proteins is one of the key steps in the replication process of all RNA viruses. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, including primary RNA elements that are recognized by the <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> replicase proteins, are not well understood. Here, we used aptamer pulldown assays with membrane fractionation and protein-RNA coimmunoprecipitation in a cell-free <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> translation/replication system to investigate how <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> replicase proteins recognize the bipartite genomic RNAs of the <span class="annotated ">Red clover necrotic mosaic virus</span> (<span class="match annotated ">RCNMV</span>). <span class="match annotated ">RCNMV</span> replicase proteins bound specifically to a Y-shaped RNA element (YRE) located in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of RNA2, which also interacted with the 480-kDa replicase complexes that contain <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> and host proteins. The replicase-YRE interaction recruited RNA2 to the membrane fraction. Conversely, RNA1 fragments failed to interact with the replicase proteins supplied in trans. The results of protein-RNA coimmunoprecipitation assays suggest that RNA1 interacts with the replicase proteins coupled with their translation. Thus, the initial template recognition mechanisms employed by the replicase differ between <span class="match annotated ">RCNMV</span> bipartite genomic RNAs and RNA elements are primary determinants of the differential replication mechanism.
