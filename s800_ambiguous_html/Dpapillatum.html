<h2>D. papillatum</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21377422</h3>Compartmentalization of a glycolytic enzyme in Diplonema, a non-kinetoplastid euglenozoan. <br><br>Glycosomes are peroxisome-related organelles containing glycolytic enzymes that have been found only in kinetoplastids. We show here that a glycolytic enzyme is compartmentalized in diplonemids, the sister group of kinetoplastids. We found that, similar to kinetoplastid aldolases, the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase of <span class="annotated ">Diplonema papillatum</span> possesses a type 2-peroxisomal targeting signal. Western blotting showed that this aldolase was present predominantly in the membrane/organellar fraction. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that this aldolase had a scattered distribution in the cytosol, suggesting its compartmentalization. In contrast, orotidine-5'-monophosphate decarboxylase, a non-glycolytic glycosomal enzyme in kinetoplastids, was shown to be a cytosolic enzyme in <span class="match annotated ">D. papillatum</span>. Since euglenoids, the earliest diverging branch of Euglenozoa, do not possess glycolytic compartments, these findings suggest that the routing of glycolytic enzymes into peroxisomes may have occurred in a common ancestor of diplonemids and kinetoplastids, followed by diversification of these newly established organelles in each of these euglenozoan lineages.
