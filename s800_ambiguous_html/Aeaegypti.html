<h2>Ae. aegypti</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20958808</h3>The RNA-Seq approach to studying the expression of mosquito mitochondrial genes. <br><br>In this study, we used extensive expressed sequence tag evidence obtained through 454 and Solexa next-generation sequencing to explore mtDNA transcription in male and female first instar larvae of <span class="annotated ">Aedes aegypti</span> and adults of <span class="annotated ">Aedes aegypti</span>, <span class="annotated ">Anopheles gambiae</span>, and <span class="annotated ">Anopheles quadrimaculatus</span>. Relative abundances of individual transcripts differed considerably within each sample, consistent with the differential stability of messenger RNA species. Large differences were also observed between species and between larval and adult stages; however, the male and female larval samples were remarkably similar. Quantitative PCR analysis of selected genes, cox1, l-rRNA and nd5, in larvae and adults of <span class="match annotated ">Ae. aegypti</span> and in <span class="annotated ">An. gambiae</span> adults was consistent with the RNA-Seq-based quantification of expression. Finally, the absence of a conserved mtDNA region involved in transcriptional control in other dipterans suggests that mosquitoes have evolved a distinct mechanism of regulation of gene expression in the mitochondrion. 
<h3>21114562</h3>Improved accuracy of the transcriptional profiling method of age grading in <span class="annotated ">Aedes aegypti mosquitoes</span> under laboratory and semi-field cage conditions and in the presence of Wolbachia infection. <br><br>Transcriptional profiling is an effective method of predicting age in the mosquito <span class="annotated ">Aedes aegypti</span> in the laboratory, however, its effectiveness is limited to younger mosquitoes. To address this we used a microarray to identify new gene candidates that show significant expression changes in older mosquitoes. These genes were then used to create a revised model, which upon evaluation in both laboratory and semi-field conditions, proved to have improved accuracy overall and for older mosquitoes. In association with the development of symbiont-based control strategies for <span class="match annotated ">Ae. aegypti</span>, we also tested the model's accuracy for Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes and found no decline in performance. Our findings suggest that the new model is a robust and powerful tool for age determination in Australian <span class="match annotated ">Ae. aegypti</span> populations. 
<h3>21699593</h3>Comparison of transgene expression in <span class="annotated ">Aedes aegypti</span> generated by mariner Mos1 transposition and PhiC31 site-directed recombination. <br><br>Transgenic mosquitoes generated by transposable elements (TEs) often poorly express transgenes owing to position effects. To avoid these effects, the PhiC31 site-directed recombination system was used to insert transgenes into a locus favourable for gene expression in <span class="annotated ">Aedes aegypti</span>. We describe phenotypes of mariner Mos1 TE and PhiC31 transgenic mosquitoes expressing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter in midguts of blood-fed females. Mosquitoes of nine TE-generated lines [estimated transformation frequency (TF): 9.3%] clearly expressed the eye-specific selection marker but only 2/9 lines robustly expressed the EGFP reporter. The piggyBac TE-generated PhiC31 docking strain, attP26, supported recombination with attB site containing donors at an estimated TF of 1.7-4.9%. Using a codon-optimized PhiC31 integrase mutant instead of the 'wild-type' enzyme did not affect TF. Site-directed recombination of line attP26 with an attB-containing donor expressing EGFP from the <span class="match annotated ">Ae. aegypti</span> carboxypeptidase promoter produced one transgenic line with blood-fed females expressing the reporter in midgut tissue. Docking strain attP26 also supported robust expression of <span class="annotated ">Flock House virus B2</span> from the <span class="match annotated ">Ae. aegypti</span> polyubiquitin promoter. Our data confirm that eye-specific selection marker expression alone is not a reliable indicator for robust gene-of-interest expression in <span class="match annotated ">Ae. aegypti</span> and that the PhiC31 system can ensure predictable transgene expression in this mosquito species. 
<h3>21699592</h3>Characterization of the oxysterol-binding protein gene family in the <span class="annotated ">yellow fever mosquito</span>, <span class="annotated ">Aedes aegypti</span>. <br><br>The oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) and OSBP-related proteins (ORPs) are sterol-binding proteins that may be involved in cellular sterol transportation, sterol metabolism and signal transduction pathways. Four ORP genes were cloned from <span class="annotated ">Aedes aegypti</span>. Based on amino acid sequence homology to <span class="annotated ">human</span> proteins, they are AeOSBP, AeORP1, AeORP8 and AeORP9. Splicing variants of AeOSBP and AeORP8 were identified. The temporal and spatial transcription patterns of members of the AeOSBP gene family through developmental stages and the gonotrophic cycle were profiled. AeORP1 transcription seemed to be head tissue-specific, whereas AeOSBP and AeORP9 expression was induced by a bloodmeal. Furthermore, over-expression of AeORPs facilitated [(3)H]-cholesterol uptake in <span class="match annotated ">Ae. aegypti</span> cultured Aag -2 cells.
