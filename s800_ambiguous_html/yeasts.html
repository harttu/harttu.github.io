<h2>yeasts</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20139282</h3>Proposal of Mingxiaea gen. nov. for the anamorphic basidiomycetous <span class="annotated ">yeast</span> species in the Bulleribasidium clade (Tremellales) based on molecular phylogenetic analysis, with six new combinations and four novel species. <br><br>The distinction and monophyletic property of the basidiomycetous <span class="annotated ">yeast</span> species in the Bulleribasidium clade of the order Tremellales was resolved by molecular phylogenetic analysis based on the combined sequences of the 18S rRNA gene, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region including 5.8S rRNA gene and 26S rRNA gene D1/D2 domain. The addition to the clade of new anamorphic species identified among ballistoconidium-forming <span class="match annotated ">yeasts</span> isolated from China confirmed and strengthened the separation of this clade from other clades or lineages in the order Tremellales. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> new anamorphic genus, Mingxiaea gen. nov. (type species Mingxiaea variabilis comb. nov.) is therefore proposed to accommodate the anamorphic species in the Bulleribasidium clade. Six new combinations are proposed for the described species of this clade which were formerly assigned to the genus Bullera. Four novel species in the new genus were identified among 16 ballistoconidium-forming <span class="annotated ">yeast</span> strains isolated from plant leaves collected in Hainan province, southern China, by D1/D2 and ITS sequence analyses. The novel species are described as Mingxiaea sanyaensis sp. nov. (type strain SY-3.23(T) =AS 2. 3623(T) =CBS 11408(T)), Mingxiaea hainanensis (type strain WZS-8.13(T) =AS 2.4161(T) =CBS 11409(T)), Mingxiaea foliicola (type strain WZS-8.14(T) =AS 2.3518(T) =CBS 11407(T)) and Mingxiaea wuzhishanensis (type strain WZS-29.8(T) =AS 2.4163(T) =CBS 11411(T)). 
<h3>21272794</h3>Emerging opportunistic <span class="unannotated ">yeast</span> infections.<br><br>A growing population of immunosuppressed <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span> has resulted in increasingly frequent diagnoses of invasive <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> infections, including those caused by unusual <span class="match unannotated ">yeasts</span>. The incidence of non-albicans species of Candida is increasing compared with that of <span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span>, and several species, such as <span class="annotated ">Candida glabrata</span> and <span class="annotated ">Candida krusei</span>, may be resistant to azole antifungal therapy. Trichosporon species are the second most common cause of fungaemia in <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span> with haematological malignant disease and are characterised by resistance to amphotericin and echinocandins and poor prognosis. Rhodotorula species belong to the family Cryptococcaceae, and are a cause of catheter-related fungaemia, sepsis, and invasive disease in severely immunosuppressed <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span>. An increasing number of sporadic cases of invasive <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> infections by non-neoformans cryptococci have been reported in immunocompromised hosts, especially for <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span> with advanced <span class="annotated ">HIV</span> infection or cancer who are undergoing transplant. Other uncommon <span class="match unannotated ">yeasts</span> that can cause invasive disease in severely immunosuppressed <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span> include Geotrichum, Hansenula, Malassezia, and Saccharomyces. Host immune status is a crucial determinant of the type of invasive <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> infection a <span class="linneaus_only ">patient</span> is at risk for. Diagnosis can be challenging and relies heavily on traditional cultures of blood and other sterile sites, although serum (1,3)-Beta-D-glucan testing might have an adjunctive role. Although rare <span class="match unannotated ">yeasts</span> are emerging as opportunistic <span class="annotated ">human</span> pathogens, diagnosis remains challenging and treatment suboptimal. 
<h3>21801845</h3>The transcriptional response of <span class="annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> to proapoptotic concentrations of <span class="annotated ">Pichia membranifaciens</span> killer toxin. <br><br>PMKT (<span class="annotated ">Pichia membranifaciens</span> killer toxin) reportedly has antimicrobial activity against <span class="match annotated ">yeasts</span> and filamentous fungi. In previous research we posited that high PMKT concentrations pose a serious challenge for cell survival by disrupting plasma membrane electrochemical gradients, inducing a transcriptional response similar to that of certain stimuli such as hyperosmotic shock. This response was related to the HOG-pathway with Hog1p phosphorylation and a transitional increase in intracellular glycerol accumulation. Such a response was consistent with the notion that the effect induced by high PMKT concentrations lies in an alteration to the ionic homeostasis of the sensitive cell. By contrast, the evidence presented here shows that low PMKT doses lead to a cell death process in <span class="annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> accompanied by cytological and biochemical indicators of apoptotic programmed cell death, namely, the production of reactive oxygen species, DNA strand breaks, metacaspase activation and cytochrome c release. Furthermore, dying cells progressed from an apoptotic state to a secondary necrotic state, and the rate at which this change occurred was proportional to the intensity of the stimulus. We have explored the global gene expression response of <span class="annotated ">S. cerevisiae</span> during that stimulus. The results obtained from DNA microarrays indicate that genes related with an oxidative stress response were induced in response to proapoptotic concentrations of PMKT, showing that the coordinated transcriptional response is not coincident with that obtained when ionophoric concentrations of PMKT are used. By contrast, cwp2Delta mutants showed no signs of apoptosis, indicating that the initial steps of the killer mechanism coincide when proapoptotic (low) or ionophoric (high) PMKT concentrations are used. Additionally, low dosages of PMKT promoted Hog1p phosphorylation and glycerol accumulation. 
<h3>21176788</h3>Hyphal and cytoskeleton polarization in <span class="annotated ">Tuber melanosporum</span>: a genomic and cellular analysis. <br><br>Filamentous polarized growth involves a series of events including polarization of the cytoskeleton to selected growth sites, and the transport of secretory vesicles containing the components required for growth. The availability of <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> genome sequences has recently led to the identification of a large number of proteins involved in these processes. We have explored the <span class="annotated ">Tuber melanosporum</span> genome sequence by searching for homologs of genes known to play crucial roles in the morphogenesis and cell polarity of <span class="match annotated ">yeasts</span> and filamentous fungi. One hundred and forty-nine genes have been identified and functionally grouped according to the deduced amino acid sequences (44 genes involved in cell polarity/morphogenesis, 39 belonging to the actin cytoskeleton and 66 involved in membrane dynamics, septation and exocytosis). <span class="unannotated ">A</span> detailed gene annotation has shown that most components of the cell polarity machinery, morphogenesis and cytoskeleton found in <span class="match annotated ">yeasts</span> and filamentous fungi are conserved, although the degree of similarity varies from strong to weak. Microscopic analysis of quick-frozen <span class="unannotated ">truffle</span> hyphae detected the characteristic subcellular components of the hyphal tip in septate filamentous fungi, while transcript profiles revealed a moderately variable pattern during the biological cycle.
