<h2>fly</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20923688</h3>Universal primers for rapid detection of hytrosaviruses.<br><br>Hytrosaviridae is a proposed <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> family encompassing viruses that cause salivary gland hypertrophy (SGH) syndrome in infected insects and reduce the fertility in their dipteran insect hosts. They contain a large, double stranded DNA genome of 120-190 kbp. To date, these viruses have been detected only in adult Diptera. These include hytrosaviruses detected in various tsetse <span class="match linneaus_only ">fly</span> species (Glossina spp.), the <span class="annotated ">narcissus bulb fly</span> <span class="annotated ">Merodon equestris</span> and the <span class="annotated ">house fly</span> <span class="annotated ">Musca domestica</span>. The limited number of hytrosaviruses reported to date may be a reflection of the frequent absence of external symptoms in infected adult <span class="linneaus_only ">flies</span> and the fact that the <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> does not cause rapid mortality. Based on the complete genome sequence of <span class="annotated ">Glossinia pallidipes</span> (GpSGHV) and <span class="annotated ">Musca domestica</span> (MdSGHV) salivary gland hypertrophy viruses, a PCR based methodology was developed to detect the viruses in these species. To be able to detect hytrosaviruses in other Diptera, five degenerate primer pairs were designed and tested on GpSGHV and MdSGHV DNA using gradient PCR with annealing temperatures from 37 to 61^0C. Two pairs of primers were selected from p74, two pairs from PIF-1 and one pair from ODV-e66 homologous proteins. Four primer pairs generated a <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> specific PCR product on both MdSGHV and GpSGHV at all tested annealing temperatures, while the ODV-e66 based primers did not generate a <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> specific product with annealing temperatures higher that 47^0C. No non-specific PCR product was found when using genomic DNA of infected <span class="linneaus_only ">flies</span> as template DNA. These results offer new sets of primers that could be used to detect hytrosaviruses in other insects. 
<h3>21526930</h3>Fire ant decapitating <span class="match linneaus_only ">fly</span> cooperative release programs (1994-2008): two Pseudacteon species, <span class="annotated ">P. tricuspis</span> and <span class="annotated ">P. curvatus</span>, rapidly expand across imported <span class="unannotated ">fire ant</span> populations in the southeastern United States. <br><br>Natural enemies of the imported <span class="unannotated ">fire ants</span>, <span class="annotated ">Solenopsis invicta Buren</span> <span class="annotated ">S. richteri Forel</span> (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), and their hybrid, include a suite of more than 20 <span class="unannotated ">fire ant</span> decapitating phorid <span class="linneaus_only ">flies</span> from South America in the genus Pseudacteon. Over the past 12 years, many researchers and associates have cooperated in introducing several species as classical or self-sustaining biological control agents in the United States. As a result, two species of <span class="linneaus_only ">flies</span>, <span class="annotated ">Pseudacteon tricuspis Borgmeier</span> and <span class="annotated ">P. curvatus Borgmeier</span> (Diptera: Phoridae), are well established across large areas of the southeastern United States. Whereas many researchers have published local and state information about the establishment and spread of these <span class="linneaus_only ">flies</span>, here distribution data from both published and unpublished sources has been compiled for the entire United States with the goal of presenting confirmed and probable distributions as of the fall of 2008. Documented rates of expansion were also used to predict the distribution of these <span class="linneaus_only ">flies</span> three years later in the fall of 2011. In the fall of 2008, eleven years after the first successful release, we estimate that <span class="annotated ">P. tricuspis</span> covered about 50% of the <span class="unannotated ">fire ant</span> quarantined area and that it will occur in almost 65% of the quarantine area by 2011. Complete coverage of the <span class="unannotated ">fire ant</span> quarantined area will be delayed or limited by this species' slow rate of spread and frequent failure to establish in more northerly portions of the <span class="unannotated ">fire ant</span> range and also, perhaps, by its preference for <span class="annotated ">red imported fire ants</span> (<span class="annotated ">S. invicta</span>). Eight years after the first successful release of <span class="annotated ">P. curvatus</span>, two biotypes of this species (one biotype occurring predominantly in the <span class="annotated ">black</span> and hybrid imported <span class="unannotated ">fire ants</span> and the other occurring in <span class="annotated ">red imported fire ants</span>) covered almost 60% of the <span class="unannotated ">fire ant</span> quarantined area. We estimate these two biotypes will cover almost 90% of the quarantine area by 2011 and 100% by 2012 or 2013. Strategic selection of several distributional gaps for future releases will accelerate complete coverage of quarantine areas. However, some gaps may be best used for the release of additional species of decapitating <span class="linneaus_only ">flies</span> because establishment rates may be higher in areas without competing species. 
<h3>21526935</h3>Assessment of attractiveness of <span class="annotated ">cassava</span> as a roosting plant for the <span class="annotated ">melon fly</span>, <span class="annotated ">Bactrocera cucurbitae</span>, and the <span class="annotated ">Oriental fruit fly</span>, <span class="annotated ">B. dorsalis</span>. <br><br>Application of bait spray to crop borders is a standard approach for suppression of <span class="annotated ">melon fly</span>, <span class="annotated ">Bactrocera cucurbitae</span> (Coquillett) (Diptera: Tephritidae) populations and may also be of value for suppression of <span class="annotated ">oriental fruit fly</span>, <span class="annotated ">B. dorsalis</span> (Hendel) populations. Establishment of preferred roosting hosts as crop borders may help to improve suppression of both fruit <span class="match linneaus_only ">fly</span> species by providing sites for bait spray applications. In an area-wide <span class="annotated ">B. cucurbitae</span> suppression trial, the question was raised as to whether <span class="annotated ">cassava</span>, <span class="annotated ">Manihot esculenta</span> Crantz (Euphorbiales: Euphorbiaceae), could be used as a <span class="annotated ">B. cucurbitae</span> roosting host. <span class="annotated ">M. esculenta</span> was of interest as a roosting host because, in contrast to many other identified preferred roosting hosts, it would also be a crop potentially increasing the productivity of the crop production system overall. As a short-lived and shrubby perennial, <span class="annotated ">M. esculenta</span> potentially constitutes a crop with more persistent roosting foliage than an annual crop such as <span class="annotated ">corn</span>, <span class="annotated ">Zea mays</span> L. (Cyperales: Poaceae), that has often been planted as a roosting host for <span class="annotated ">B. cucurbitae</span> control. Using protein-baited traps set amidst potted plants placed adjacent to a <span class="annotated ">papaya</span> <span class="annotated ">Carica papaya</span> L. (Violales: Caricaceae) orchard known to have established populations of <span class="annotated ">B. cucurbitae</span> and <span class="annotated ">B. dorsalis</span>, the effectiveness of <span class="annotated ">M. esculenta</span> as a roosting host was assessed by comparing its attractiveness to that of <span class="annotated ">castor bean</span>, <span class="annotated ">Ricinus communis</span> L (Malpighiales: Euphorbiaceae), previously identified as one of the most attractive roosting hosts for <span class="annotated ">B. cucurbitae</span>, and to <span class="annotated ">corn</span>, a crop which has been planted as a roosting host for help in <span class="annotated ">B. cucurbitae</span> control. The results showed that use of <span class="annotated ">M. esculenta</span> as a roosting host is comparable to use of <span class="annotated ">R. communis</span> by both <span class="annotated ">B. cucurbitae</span> and <span class="annotated ">B. dorsalis</span>. These results provide encouragement to incorporate <span class="annotated ">M. esculenta</span> on a farm as a trap crop (i.e. site for bait spray application). This has the advantage of having the trap crop be a crop on its own (as opposed to <span class="annotated ">castor bean</span>) and, among prospective crops that could be used as a trap crop, has foliage more persistent than an annual trap crop such as <span class="annotated ">corn</span>. 
<h3>22182616</h3>The ability of selected pupal parasitoids (hymenoptera: pteromalidae) to locate <span class="annotated ">stable fly</span> hosts in a soiled equine bedding substrate. <br><br>The ability of <span class="annotated ">Spalangia cameroni</span> Perkins, <span class="annotated ">Spalangia endius</span> Walker, and <span class="annotated ">Muscidifurax raptorellus</span> Kogan and Legner to locate and attack <span class="annotated ">stable fly</span> hosts was evaluated under laboratory conditions. Postfeeding third-instar <span class="annotated ">stable fly</span> larvae were released and allowed to pupate in two arena types: large 4.8 liter chambers containing a field-collected, soiled equine bedding substrate; or 120-ml plastic cups containing wood chips. At the time of <span class="match linneaus_only ">fly</span> pupariation, parasitoids were released and permitted 72 h to locate and attack hosts. On average, parasitism rates of freely accessible <span class="annotated ">stable fly</span> pupae in cups were not significantly different between parasitoid species. However, parasitism rates in chambers containing either Spalangia spp. were =50-fold more than <span class="annotated ">M. raptorellus</span>. Additional intraspecies analysis revealed that parasitism rates both by <span class="annotated ">S. cameroni</span> and <span class="annotated ">S. endius</span> were not significantly different when pupae were freely accessible or within bedding, whereas <span class="annotated ">M. raptorellus</span> attacked significantly more pupae in cups than in the larger chambers where hosts were distributed within bedding. These results suggest that Spalangia spp. are more suited to successfully locate and attack hosts in habitats created by equine husbandry in Florida. Therefore, commercially available parasitoid mixtures containing Muscidifurax spp. may be ineffective if used as a control measure at Florida equine facilities.
