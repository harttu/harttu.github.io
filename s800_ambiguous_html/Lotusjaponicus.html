<h2>Lotus japonicus</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20868395</h3>Role of lupeol synthase in <span class="blue">Lotus japonicus</span> nodule formation.<br><br>* Triterpenes are plant secondary metabolites, derived from the cyclization of 2,3-oxidosqualene by oxidosqualene cyclases (OSCs). Here, we investigated the role of lupeol synthase, encoded by OSC3, and its product, lupeol, in developing roots and nodules of the model legume <span class="blue">Lotus japonicus</span>. * The expression patterns of OSC3 in different developmental stages of uninfected roots and in roots infected with <span class="yellow">Mesorhizobium loti</span> were determined. The tissue specificity of OSC3 expression was analysed by in situ hybridization. Functional analysis, in which transgenic <span class="yellow">L. japonicus</span> roots silenced for OSC3 were generated, was performed. The absence of lupeol in the silenced plant lines was determined by GC-MS. * The expression of ENOD40, a marker gene for nodule primordia initiation, was increased significantly in the OSC3-silenced plant lines, suggesting that lupeol influences nodule formation. Silenced plants also showed a more rapid nodulation phenotype, consistent with this. Exogenous application of lupeol to <span class="yellow">M. loti</span>-infected wild-type plants provided further evidence for a negative regulatory effect of lupeol on the expression of ENOD40. * The synthesis of lupeol in <span class="yellow">L. japonicus</span> roots and nodules can be solely attributed to OSC3. Taken together, our data suggest a role for lupeol biosynthesis in nodule formation through the regulation of ENOD40 gene expression.
