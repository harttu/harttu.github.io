<h2>Flock House virus B2</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21699593</h3>Comparison of transgene expression in <span class="annotated ">Aedes aegypti</span> generated by mariner Mos1 transposition and PhiC31 site-directed recombination. <br><br>Transgenic mosquitoes generated by transposable elements (TEs) often poorly express transgenes owing to position effects. To avoid these effects, the PhiC31 site-directed recombination system was used to insert transgenes into a locus favourable for gene expression in <span class="annotated ">Aedes aegypti</span>. We describe phenotypes of mariner Mos1 TE and PhiC31 transgenic mosquitoes expressing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter in midguts of blood-fed females. Mosquitoes of nine TE-generated lines [estimated transformation frequency (TF): 9.3%] clearly expressed the eye-specific selection marker but only 2/9 lines robustly expressed the EGFP reporter. The piggyBac TE-generated PhiC31 docking strain, attP26, supported recombination with attB site containing donors at an estimated TF of 1.7-4.9%. Using a codon-optimized PhiC31 integrase mutant instead of the 'wild-type' enzyme did not affect TF. Site-directed recombination of line attP26 with an attB-containing donor expressing EGFP from the <span class="annotated ">Ae. aegypti</span> carboxypeptidase promoter produced one transgenic line with blood-fed females expressing the reporter in midgut tissue. Docking strain attP26 also supported robust expression of <span class="match annotated ">Flock House virus B2</span> from the <span class="annotated ">Ae. aegypti</span> polyubiquitin promoter. Our data confirm that eye-specific selection marker expression alone is not a reliable indicator for robust gene-of-interest expression in <span class="annotated ">Ae. aegypti</span> and that the PhiC31 system can ensure predictable transgene expression in this mosquito species.
