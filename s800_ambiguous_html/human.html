</br>
In this context , it cannot be unambiguously concluded that fire disturbance , even in a context in which fires are greatly favoured by <b>human</b> - related activities , leads to more functionally simplified communities dominated by generalist species . 
</br>
Human adenoviruses ( HAdV ) and JC polyomaviruses ( JCPyV ) have been proposed as markers of fecal / urine contamination of <b>human</b> origin . 
</br>
In this paper a novel MDCK cell line ( MDCK - SFS ) is described that grows efficiently in suspension and retained high expression levels of both alpha - 2 , 6 and alpha - 2 , 3 sialic acid receptors , which bind preferably to <b>human</b> and avian influenza viruses , respectively . 
</br>
We now demonstrate the derivation of functional NK cells from <b>human</b> induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) . 
</br>
Additional studies using SB__HIV SI__- SI__1 - infected <b>human</b> primary CD4 ( + ) T cells illustrated that hESC - and iPSC - derived NK cells suppress SB__HIV SI__- SI__1 infection by at least three distinct cellular mechanisms : killing of infected targets through direct lysis , antibody - dependent cellular cytotoxicity , and production of chemokines and cytokines . 
</br>
Determination of the <b>human</b> epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ; also known as ERBB2 ) status of breast tumours is emphasised in various national guidelines as a necessary step for the diagnosis of breast cancer . 
</br>
To expand the representation for phylogenetic analysis , ten additional complete Entamoeba small - subunit rRNA gene sequences were obtained from SB__humans , non - <b>human</b> primates , SB__cattle and a tortoise .
