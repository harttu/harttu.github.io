<h2>human</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20044015</h3>Characterizing the role of the microtubule binding protein Bim1 in <span class="yellow">Cryptococcus neoformans</span>. 

During sexual development the <span class="blue">human</span> <span class="yellow">fungal</span> pathogen <span class="yellow">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> undergoes a developmental transition from yeast-form growth to filamentous growth. This transition requires cellular restructuring to form a filamentous dikaryon. Dikaryotic growth also requires tightly controlled nuclear migration to ensure faithful replication and dissemination of genetic material to spore progeny. Although the gross morphological changes that take place during dikaryotic growth are largely known, the molecular underpinnings that control this process are uncharacterized. Here we identify and characterize a <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span> homolog of the <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> BIM1 gene, and establish the importance of BIM1 for proper filamentous growth of <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span>. Deletion of BIM1 leads to truncated sexual development filaments, a severe defect in diploid formation, and a block in monokaryotic fruiting. Our findings lead to a model consistent with a critical role for BIM1 in both filament integrity and nuclear congression that is mediated through the microtubule cytoskeleton. 
<h3>20139283</h3><span class="yellow">Scardovia wiggsiae</span> sp. nov., isolated from the <span class="blue">human</span> oral cavity and clinical material, and emended descriptions of the genus Scardovia and <span class="yellow">Scardovia inopinata</span>. 

Six strains of anaerobic, pleomorphic Gram-positive bacilli, isolated from the <span class="blue">human</span> oral cavity and an infected arm wound, were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests and were found to comprise a homogeneous group. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the isolates were most closely related to <span class="yellow">Scardovia inopinata</span> CCUG 35729(T) (94.8-94.9 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). The isolates were saccharolytic and produced acetic and lactic acids as end products of fermentation. The major fatty acids were C(16 : 0) (49.8 %) and C(18 : 1)omega9c (35.8 %). Polar lipid analysis revealed a variety of glycolipids, diphosphatidylglycerol, an unidentified phospholipid and an unidentified phosphoglycolipid. No respiratory quinones were detected. The peptidoglycan was of the type A4alpha L-Lys-Thr-Glu, with L-lysine partially replaced by L-ornithine. The DNA G+C content of one of the strains, C1A_55(T)(,) was 55 mol%. <span class="yellow">A</span> novel species, <span class="yellow">Scardovia wiggsiae</span> sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate the six isolates, with the type strain C1A_55(T) (=DSM 22547(T)=CCUG 58090(T)). 
<h3>20650684</h3>Possible roles of phospholipase A(2) in the biological activities of <span class="yellow">Acanthamoeba castellanii</span> (T4 Genotype). 

Using phospholipases A(2)-specific spectrophotometric assays, it was shown that <span class="yellow">A. castellanii</span> lysates and their conditioned medium exhibit phospholipase activities. The extracellular levels of PLA(2)detected were significantly reduced compared with the cell-associated enzyme (P&lt;0.05). Sphinganine, a PLA(2)inhibitor showed robust amoebistatic properties but had no effect on the viability of <span class="yellow">A. castellanii</span>. The potency of sphinganine was demonstrated effectively towards purified PLA(2)derived from porcine pancreas. Using sphinganine, it was observed that PLA(2)is involved in neither binding nor cytotoxicity of the <span class="blue">human</span> brain microvascular endothelial cells due to <span class="yellow">A. castellanii</span>. Unlike as was the case for Dictyostelium amoebae, PLA(2) appeared to be involved in <span class="yellow">A. castellanii</span> phagocytosis of the fluorescently-labelled polystyrene beads. <span class="yellow">Horseradish</span> peroxidase was used as a tracer molecule to develop assays to study pinocytosis in <span class="yellow">A. castellanii</span>. The findings revealed that sphinganine impedes phagocytosis but augments pinocytosis in <span class="yellow">A. castellanii</span> suggesting distinct nature of processes. <span class="yellow">A</span> complete understanding of the role of phospholipases in the biology and pathogenesis of <span class="yellow">A. castellanii</span> infections will determine their potential as therapeutic targets. 
<h3>20719250</h3>Regulation of virulence factors, carbon utilization and virulence by SNF1 in <span class="yellow">Cryptococcus neoformans JEC21</span> and divergent actions of SNF1 between cryptococcal strains. 

We describe here the functions of a Snf1/AMPK homolog in the <span class="red">human</span> pathogenic <span class="yellow">yeast</span> <span class="yellow">Cryptococcus neoformans</span>, strain <span class="yellow">JEC21</span>. We found that <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1 is a key regulator for the biosynthesis of the major virulence factors, stress resistance and alternative carbon source utilization. Disruption of <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1 results in defects of laccase activity and capsule production, sensitivity to cation stress. Especially, we found that <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1 is essential for growth at elevated temperature and for thermotolerance. To our knowledge, a role for Snf1 proteins in thermotolerance has not been reported. Furthermore, we observed a functional divergence between <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1 and its equivalent from <span class="yellow">serotype A</span><span class="yellow">A</span> strain <span class="yellow">H99</span>. <span class="yellow">A</span> high temperature is needed for <span class="yellow">H99</span> SNF1 to function in stress response and carbon source preference, but not for the <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1. Our results confirmed a critical role of <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1 in regulation of stress response and virulence. Revelation of divergent actions of SNF1 may help to understand the evolution of cryptococcal pathogenesis and provides insights into the strain-associated biosynthesis of virulence factors. 
<h3>20863853</h3>Detection and quantitation of infectious <span class="yellow">human adenoviruses</span> and <span class="yellow">JC polyomaviruses</span> in water by immunofluorescence assay. 

Human adenoviruses (HAdV) and <span class="yellow">JC polyomaviruses</span> (JCPyV) have been proposed as markers of fecal/urine contamination of <span class="red">human</span> origin. An indirect immunofluorescence assay has been developed to quantify infectious <span class="yellow">human adenoviruses</span> types 2 and 41 and <span class="yellow">JC polyomaviruses</span> strain Mad-4 in water samples. The immunofluorescence assay was compared with other quantitative techniques used commonly such as plaque assay, tissue culture infectious dose-50 and quantitative PCR (qPCR). The immunofluorescence assays showed to be specific for the detection of infectious viruses, obtaining negative results when UV or heat-inactivated viruses were analyzed. The assays required less time and showed higher sensitivity for the detection of infectious <span class="yellow">viral</span> particles than other cell culture techniques (1 log(10) more) evaluated. River water samples spiked previously with <span class="blue">human</span><span class="yellow">human adenoviruses</span> and raw sewage samples were also analyzed using the proposed immunofluorescence assay as well as by qPCR. The results show quantitations with 2 log(10) reduction in the numbers of infectious viruses compared with the number of genome copies detected by qPCR. The immunofluorescence assay developed is fast, sensitive, specific, and a standardizable technique for the quantitation and detection of infectious viruses in water samples. 
<h3>20887797</h3>The FvMK1 mitogen-activated protein kinase gene regulates conidiation, pathogenesis, and fumonisin production in <span class="yellow">Fusarium verticillioides</span>. 

<span class="yellow">Fusarium verticillioides</span> is one of the most important <span class="yellow">fungal</span> pathogens to cause destructive diseases of <span class="yellow">maize</span> worldwide. Fumonisins produced by the fungus are harmful to <span class="blue">human</span> and animal health. To date, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with pathogenicity and fumonisin biosynthesis in <span class="yellow">F. verticillioides</span> is limited. Because MAP kinase pathways have been implicated in regulating diverse processes important for plant infection in phytopathogenic fungi, in this study we identified and functionally characterized the FvMK1 gene in <span class="yellow">F. verticillioides</span>. FvMK1 is orthologous to FMK1 in <span class="yellow">F. oxysporum</span> and GPMK1 in <span class="yellow">F. graminearum</span>. The Fvmk1 deletion mutant was reduced in vegetative growth and production of microconidia. However, it was normal in sexual reproduction and increased in the production of macroconidia. In infection assays with developing <span class="yellow">corn</span> kernels, the Fvmk1 mutant was non-pathogenic and failed to colonize through wounding sites. It also failed to cause stalk rot symptoms beyond the inoculation sites on <span class="yellow">corn</span> stalks, indicating that FvMK1 is essential for plant infection. Furthermore, the Fvmk1 mutant was significantly reduced in fumonisin production and expression levels of FUM1 and FUM8, two genes involved in fumonisin biosynthesis. The defects of the Fvmk1 mutant were fully complemented by re-introducing the wild type FvMK1 allele. These results demonstrate that FvMK1 plays critical roles in the regulation of vegetative growth, asexual reproduction, fumonisin biosynthesis, and pathogenicity. 
<h3>20933016</h3>Detection and differentiation of <span class="yellow">tick-borne encephalitis virus</span> subtypes by a reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR and pyrosequencing. 

<span class="yellow">Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus</span> causes one of the most important flaviviral infections of the <span class="blue">human</span> central nervous system in Europe and Asia. In recent years the rate of <span class="yellow">TBE</span> infection has been raising and the <span class="yellow">virus</span> has been spreading to new areas. Currently, the diagnosis of <span class="yellow">TBE</span> is based on detection of specific antibodies in patients' sera which appear as late as about 2 weeks post-infection. For a timely diagnosis of <span class="yellow">TBE virus</span> infections and epidemiological studies, a <span class="yellow">TBE virus</span>-specific reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) followed by pyrosequencing was developed. The assay is based on one degenerated primer pair detecting all three <span class="blue">human</span>-pathogenic <span class="yellow">TBE virus</span> subtypes with a detection limit of 10 copies. Even though primers and probe are highly degenerated, the assay is specific for <span class="yellow">TBE virus</span> species and detects all subtypes with a comparable sensitivity. Furthermore, <span class="yellow">TBE virus</span> RT-qPCR could be carried out as one-step or two-step assay. RT-qPCR can be followed by pyrosequencing which allows a rapid subtyping of <span class="yellow">TBE viruses</span>. For detection purposes an internal control to monitor RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and amplification is included. In summary, the method is sensitive, highly specific and easy-to-handle tool for the detection and differentiation of <span class="yellow">TBE virus</span> in the early phase of illness or in <span class="yellow">TBE</span> host animal species and ticks. 
<h3>20933017</h3>Adaptation of a Madin-Darby <span class="yellow">canine</span> kidney cell line to suspension growth in serum-free media and comparison of its ability to produce avian <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span> to Vero and BHK21 cell lines. 

Madin-Darby <span class="yellow">canine</span> kidney (MDCK) cells are currently considered for <span class="yellow">influenza</span> vaccine manufacturing. <span class="yellow">A</span> drawback of these cells is their anchorage dependent growth, which greatly complicates process scale-up. In this paper a novel MDCK cell line (MDCK-SFS) is described that grows efficiently in suspension and retained high expression levels of both alpha-2,6 and alpha-2,3 sialic acid receptors, which bind preferably to <span class="red">human</span> and avian <span class="yellow">influenza viruses</span>, respectively. The production of avian <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span> by BHK21, Vero and MDCK-SFS cell lines was compared. Although BHK21 cells consisted of two populations, one of which lacks the alpha-2,3 receptor, they supported the replication of two <span class="yellow">influenza</span> strains to high titres. However, BHK21 cells are generally not applicable for <span class="yellow">influenza</span> production since they supported the replication of six further strains poorly. MDCK-SFS cells yielded the highest infectious <span class="yellow">virus</span> titres and <span class="yellow">virus</span> genome equivalent concentration for five of the eight <span class="yellow">influenza</span> strains analyzed and the highest hemagglutination activity for all eight <span class="yellow">virus</span> strains. Taken together with their suitability for suspension growth this makes the MDCK-SFS cell line potentially useful for large scale <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span> production. 
<h3>20962078</h3><span class="yellow">Chikungunya virus</span> induces IPS-1-dependent innate immune activation and protein kinase R-independent translational shutoff. 

<span class="yellow">Chikungunya virus</span> (<span class="yellow">CHIKV</span>) is an arthritogenic mosquito-transmitted alphavirus that is undergoing reemergence in areas around the Indian Ocean. Despite the current and potential danger posed by this <span class="yellow">virus</span>, we know surprisingly little about the induction and evasion of <span class="yellow">CHIKV</span>-associated antiviral immune responses. With this in mind we investigated innate immune reactions to <span class="yellow">CHIKV</span> in <span class="blue">human</span> fibroblasts, a demonstrable in vivo target of <span class="yellow">virus</span> replication and spread. We show that <span class="yellow">CHIKV</span> infection leads to activation of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and subsequent transcription of IRF3-dependent antiviral genes, including beta interferon (IFN-Beta). IRF3 activation occurs by way of a virus-induced innate immune signaling pathway that includes the adaptor molecule interferon promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1). Despite strong transcriptional upregulation of these genes, however, translation of the corresponding proteins is not observed. We further demonstrate that translation of cellular (but not viral) genes is blocked during infection and that although <span class="yellow">CHIKV</span> is found to trigger inactivation of the translational molecule eukaryotic initiation factor subunit 2alpha by way of the double-stranded RNA sensor protein kinase R, this response is not required for the block to protein synthesis. Furthermore, overall diminution of cellular RNA synthesis is also observed in the presence of <span class="yellow">CHIKV</span> and transcription of IRF3-dependent antiviral genes appears specifically blocked late in infection. We hypothesize that the observed absence of IFN-Beta and antiviral proteins during infection results from an evasion mechanism exhibited by <span class="yellow">CHIKV</span> that is dependent on widespread shutoff of cellular protein synthesis and a targeted block to late synthesis of antiviral mRNA transcripts. 
<h3>20962084</h3>Modifications in the polymerase genes of a <span class="yellow">swine</span>-like triple-reassortant <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span> to generate live attenuated vaccines against 2009 pandemic <span class="yellow">H1N1 viruses</span>. 

On 11 June 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the outbreaks caused by novel <span class="yellow">swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus</span> had reached pandemic proportions. The pandemic <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> (H1N1pdm) <span class="yellow">virus</span> is the predominant <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span> strain in the <span class="blue">human</span> population. It has also crossed the species barriers and infected turkeys and <span class="yellow">swine</span> in several countries. Thus, the development of a vaccine that is effective in multiple animal species is urgently needed. We have previously demonstrated that the introduction of temperature-sensitive mutations into the PB2 and PB1 genes of an avian <span class="yellow">H9N2 virus</span>, combined with the insertion of a hemagglutinin (HA) tag in PB1, resulted in an attenuated (att) vaccine backbone for both <span class="yellow">chickens</span> and <span class="yellow">mice</span>. Because the new pandemic strain is a triple-reassortant (TR) <span class="yellow">virus</span>, we chose to introduce the double attenuating modifications into a <span class="yellow">swine</span>-like TR <span class="yellow">virus</span> isolate, <span class="yellow">A/turkey/OH/313053/04 (H3N2)</span> (ty/04), with the goal of producing live attenuated <span class="yellow">influenza</span> vaccines (LAIV). This genetically modified backbone had impaired polymerase activity and restricted <span class="yellow">virus</span> growth at elevated temperatures. In vivo characterization of two <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> vaccine candidates generated using the ty/04 att backbone demonstrated that this vaccine is highly attenuated in <span class="yellow">mice</span>, as indicated by the absence of signs of disease, limited replication, and minimum histopathological alterations in the respiratory tract. <span class="yellow">A</span> single immunization with the ty/04 att-based vaccines conferred complete protection against a lethal <span class="yellow">H1N1pdm</span><span class="yellow">H1N1pdm virus</span> infection in <span class="yellow">mice</span>. More importantly, vaccination of <span class="yellow">pigs</span> with a ty/04 att-H1N1 vaccine candidate resulted in sterilizing immunity upon an aggressive intratracheal challenge with the 2009 <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> pandemic <span class="yellow">virus</span>. Our studies highlight the safety of the ty/04 att vaccine platform and its potential as a master donor strain for the generation of live attenuated vaccines for <span class="yellow">humans</span> and livestock. 
<h3>20962087</h3>The magnitude of local immunity in the lungs of <span class="yellow">mice</span> induced by live attenuated <span class="yellow">influenza</span> vaccines is determined by local <span class="yellow">viral</span> replication and induction of cytokines. 

While live attenuated <span class="yellow">influenza</span> vaccines (LAIVs) have been shown to be efficacious and have been licensed for <span class="blue">human</span> use, the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) have to be updated for optimal protective efficacy. Little is known about the effect of different HA and NA proteins on the immunogenicity of LAIVs developed using the same backbone. <span class="yellow">A</span> panel of LAIVs that share the internal protein genes, with unique HA and NA gene segments from different <span class="yellow">influenza</span> subtypes, was rescued by reverse genetics, and a comparative study of immune responses induced by these vaccines was conducted in <span class="yellow">mice</span>. The results suggest that the magnitude of lung immunity, including pulmonary IgA antibody and memory CD8(+) T lymphocytes, induced by the vaccines depends on the replication efficiency of the LAIVs, as well as the induction of cytokines/chemokines in the lungs. However, these factors are not important in determining systemic immunity such as serum antibody titers and memory CD8(+) T cells in the spleen. <span class="yellow">A</span> qualitative analysis of immune responses induced by a single dose of an <span class="yellow">H5N1</span> LAIV revealed that the vaccine induced robust systemic and mucosal immunity in <span class="yellow">mice</span>. In addition, antibodies and memory lymphocytes established in the lungs following vaccination were required for protection against lethal challenge with homologous and heterologous <span class="yellow">H5N1 viruses</span>. Our results highlight the different requirements for inducing systemic and lung immunity that can be explored for the development of pulmonary immunity for protection against respiratory pathogens. 
<h3>20962090</h3><span class="yellow">Marek's disease virus type 1</span> microRNA miR-M3 suppresses cisplatin-induced apoptosis by targeting Smad2 of the transforming growth factor beta signal pathway. 

Viruses cause about 15% of the cancers that are still the leading causes of <span class="blue">human</span> mortality. The discovery of <span class="yellow">viral</span> oncogenes has enhanced our understanding of <span class="yellow">viral</span> oncogenesis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of virus-induced cancers are complex and require further investigation. The present study has attempted to investigate the effects of the microRNAs (miRNAs) encoded by <span class="yellow">Marek's disease virus 1</span> (<span class="yellow">MDV1</span>), a <span class="yellow">chicken</span> herpesvirus causing acute T-cell lymphomas and solid visceral tumors in <span class="yellow">chickens</span>, on anti-cancer drug-induced apoptosis and identify the targets of the miRNAs. The results showed that of the total 14 miRNAs encoded by <span class="yellow">MDV1</span>, <span class="yellow">MDV1</span>-miR-M3 significantly promoted cell survival under treatment with cisplatin, a widely used chemotherapy drug. <span class="yellow">MDV1</span>-miR-M3 suppressed cisplatin-induced apoptosis by directly downregulating expression at the protein but not the mRNA level of Smad2, a critical component in the transforming growth factor Beta signal pathway. Our data suggest that latent/oncogenic viruses may encode miRNAs to directly target cellular factors involved in antiviral processes including apoptosis, thus proactively creating a cellular environment beneficial to <span class="yellow">viral</span> latency and oncogenesis. Furthermore, the knowledge of the apoptosis resistance conferred by <span class="yellow">viral</span> miRNAs has great practical implications for improving the efficacy of chemotherapies for treating cancers, especially those induced by oncogenic viruses. 
<h3>20962093</h3><span class="yellow">Human</span> pluripotent stem cells produce natural killer cells that mediate anti-<span class="yellow">HIV-1</span> activity by utilizing diverse cellular mechanisms. 

Cell-based therapies against HIV/AIDS have been gaining increased interest. Natural killer (NK) cells are a key component of the innate immune system with the ability to kill diverse tumor cells and virus-infected cells. While NK cells have been shown to play an important role in the control of <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span> replication, their functional activities are often compromised in <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span>-infected individuals. We have previously demonstrated the derivation of NK cells from <span class="blue">human</span> embryonic stem cells (hESCs) with the ability to potently kill multiple types of tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. We now demonstrate the derivation of functional NK cells from <span class="red">human</span> induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). More importantly, both hESC- and iPSC-derived NK cells are able to inhibit <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span> NL4-3 infection of CEM-GFP cells. Additional studies using <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span>-infected <span class="red">human</span> primary CD4(+) T cells illustrated that hESC- and iPSC-derived NK cells suppress <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span> infection by at least three distinct cellular mechanisms: killing of infected targets through direct lysis, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and production of chemokines and cytokines. Our results establish the potential to utilize hESC- and iPSC-derived NK cells to better understand anti-<span class="yellow">HIV-1</span> immunity and provide a novel cellular immunotherapeutic approach to treat HIV/AIDS. 
<h3>20962099</h3>Replicative and transcriptional activities of <span class="yellow">hepatitis B virus</span> in patients coinfected with <span class="yellow">hepatitis B</span> and <span class="yellow">hepatitis delta viruses</span>. 

<span class="yellow">Hepatitis B virus</span> (<span class="yellow">HBV</span>) and <span class="yellow">hepatitis delta virus</span> (<span class="yellow">HDV</span>) interplay was investigated by examining liver and serum samples from 21 coinfected and 22 <span class="yellow">HBV</span>-monoinfected patients with chronic liver disease. Different real-time PCR assays were applied to evaluate intrahepatic amounts of <span class="yellow">HBV</span> DNA, covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), pregenomic RNA (pgRNA), pre-S/S RNAs, and <span class="yellow">HDV</span> RNA. Besides <span class="yellow">HBV</span> DNA and <span class="yellow">HDV</span> RNA levels, HBsAg concentrations in the sera were also determined. <span class="yellow">HDV</span>-coinfected cases showed significantly lower median levels of serum <span class="yellow">HBV</span> DNA (-5 log), intrahepatic relaxed-circular DNA (-2 log), and cccDNA (-2 log) than those of <span class="yellow">HBV</span>-monoinfected cases. Interestingly, pgRNA and pre-S/S RNA amounts were significantly lower (both -1 log) in <span class="yellow">HDV</span>-positive patients, whereas serum HBsAg concentrations were comparable between the two patient groups. Pre-S/S RNA and HBsAg amounts per cccDNA molecule were higher in <span class="yellow">HDV</span>-positive patients (3-fold and 1 log, respectively), showing that <span class="yellow">HBV</span> replication was reduced, whereas synthesis of envelope proteins was not specifically decreased. The ratios of cccDNA to intracellular total <span class="yellow">HBV</span> DNA showed a larger proportion of cccDNA molecules in <span class="yellow">HDV</span>-positive cases. For these patients, both intrahepatic and serum <span class="yellow">HDV</span> RNA amounts were associated with cccDNA but not with HBsAg or <span class="yellow">HBV</span> DNA levels. Finally, <span class="yellow">HBV</span> genomes with large deletions in the basal core promoter/precore region were detected in 5/21 <span class="yellow">HDV</span>-positive patients but in no <span class="yellow">HDV</span>-negative patients and were associated with lower viremia levels. These findings provide significant information about the interference exerted by <span class="yellow">HDV</span> on <span class="yellow">HBV</span> replication and transcription activities in the <span class="blue">human</span> liver. 
<h3>20971901</h3>Mapping of the <span class="yellow">Neisseria meningitidis</span> NadA cell-binding site: relevance of predicted {alpha}-helices in the NH2-terminal and dimeric coiled-coil regions. 

NadA is a trimeric autotransporter protein of <span class="yellow">Neisseria meningitidis</span> belonging to the group of oligomeric coiled-coil adhesins. It is implicated in the colonization of the <span class="blue">human</span> upper respiratory tract by hypervirulent serogroup B <span class="yellow">N. meningitidis</span> strains and is part of a multiantigen anti-serogroup B vaccine. Structure prediction indicates that NadA is made by a COOH-terminal membrane anchor (also necessary for autotranslocation to the bacterial surface), an intermediate elongated coiled-coil-rich stalk, and an NH(2)-terminal region involved in cell interaction. Electron microscopy analysis and structure prediction suggest that the apical region of NadA forms a compact and globular domain. Deletion studies proved that the NH(2)-terminal sequence (residues 24 to 87) is necessary for cell adhesion. In this study, to better define the NadA cell binding site, we exploited (i) a panel of NadA mutants lacking sequences along the coiled-coil stalk and (ii) several oligoclonal <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> antibodies, and their relative Fab fragments, directed to linear epitopes distributed along the NadA ectodomain. We identified two critical regions for the NadA-cell receptor interaction with Chang cells: the NH(2) globular head domain and the NH(2) dimeric intrachain coiled-coil alpha-helices stemming from the stalk. This raises the importance of different modules within the predicted NadA structure. The identification of linear epitopes involved in receptor binding that are able to induce interfering antibodies reinforces the importance of NadA as a vaccine antigen. 
<h3>20980500</h3>Differential regulation of <span class="yellow">human papillomavirus type 8</span> by interferon regulatory factors 3 and 7. 

The genus <span class="yellow">Beta human papillomavirus (HPV) type 8</span> is associated with nonmelanoma skin cancer in patients with epidermodysplasia verruciformis, and evidence for its protumorigenic potential in the general population increases. To date, strategies to suppress <span class="yellow">genus Beta HPV</span> infections are limited. Interferon regulatory factors IRF-3 and IRF-7 play key roles in the activation of the innate immune response to <span class="yellow">viral</span> infections. In this study, we show for the first time that both IRF-3 and IRF-7 regulate transcription of a papillomavirus, but with opposing effects. IRF-7, expressed in the suprabasal layers of <span class="blue">human</span> epidermis, increased <span class="yellow">HPV8</span> late promoter activity via direct binding to <span class="yellow">viral</span> DNA. UV-B light-induced activation of the <span class="yellow">HPV8</span> promoter involved IRF-7 as a downstream effector. In contrast, IRF-3, expressed in all layers of <span class="blue">human</span> epidermis, induced strong <span class="yellow">HPV8</span> suppression in primary keratinocytes. IRF-3-mediated suppression prevailed over IRF-7-induced <span class="yellow">HPV8</span> transcription. Unlike the E6 oncoprotein of the mucosal high-risk <span class="yellow">HPV16</span>, the <span class="yellow">HPV8</span> E6 protein did not bind to IRF-3 and only weakly antagonized its activity. Strong antiviral activity was also observed, when keratinocytes were treated with potent IRF-3 activators, poly(I:C) or RNA bearing 5' phosphates. In conclusion, we show that IRF-3 activation induces a state of cell-autonomous immunity against HPV in primary <span class="blue">human</span> keratinocytes. Our study suggests that local application of IRF-3-activating compounds might constitute an attractive novel therapeutic strategy against <span class="yellow">HPV8</span>-associated diseases, particularly in epidermodysplasia verruciformis patients. 
<h3>20980503</h3><span class="yellow">Adenovirus</span> membrane penetration activates the NLRP3 inflammasome.

<span class="yellow">Adenovirus type 5</span> (<span class="yellow">Ad5</span>) infection of macrophages results in rapid secretion of interleukin-1Beta (IL-1Beta) and is dependent on the inflammasome components NLRP3 and ASC and the catalytic activity of caspase-1. Using lentivirus-expressed short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and competitive inhibitors, we show that Ad-induced IL-1Beta release is dependent upon Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) sensing of the <span class="yellow">Ad5</span> double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome in <span class="blue">human</span> cell lines and primary monocyte-derived macrophages but not in <span class="yellow">mouse</span> macrophages. Additionally, a temperature-sensitive mutant of <span class="yellow">Ad5</span> unable to penetrate endosomal membranes, ts1, is unable to induce IL-1Beta release in TLR2-primed THP-1 cells, suggesting that penetration of endosomal membranes is required for IL-1Beta release. Disruption of lysosomal membranes and the release of cathepsin B into the cytoplasm are required for <span class="yellow">Ad</span>-induced NLRP3 activation. <span class="yellow">Ad5</span> cell entry also induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and inhibitors of ROS prevent <span class="yellow">Ad</span>-induced IL-1Beta release. <span class="yellow">Ad5</span> activation of NLRP3 also induces necrotic cell death, resulting in the release of the proinflammatory molecule HMGB1. This work further defines the mechanisms of virally induced inflammasome activation. 
<h3>20980515</h3>Reverse genetics generation of chimeric infectious Junin/Lassa <span class="yellow">virus</span> is dependent on interaction of homologous glycoprotein stable signal peptide and G2 cytoplasmic domains. 

The Arenaviridae are a diverse and globally distributed collection of viruses that are maintained primarily by rodent reservoirs. <span class="yellow">Junin virus</span> (<span class="yellow">JUNV</span>) and <span class="yellow">Lassa virus</span> (<span class="yellow">LASV</span>) can both cause significant outbreaks of severe and often fatal <span class="blue">human</span> disease throughout their respective areas of endemicity. In an effort to improve upon the existing live attenuated <span class="yellow">JUNV</span> Candid1 vaccine, we generated a genetically homogenous stock of this <span class="yellow">virus</span> from cDNA copies of the <span class="yellow">virus</span> S and L segments by using a reverse genetics system. Further, these cDNAs were used in combination with <span class="yellow">LASV</span> cDNAs to successfully generate two recombinant Candid1 <span class="yellow">JUNV</span>/<span class="yellow">LASV</span> chimeric viruses (via envelope glycoprotein [GPC] exchange). It was found that while the GPC extravirion domains were readily exchangeable, homologous stable signal peptide (SSP) and G2 transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail domains were essential for correct GPC maturation and production of infectious chimeric viruses. The switching of the <span class="yellow">JUNV</span> and <span class="yellow">LASV</span> G1/G2 ectodomains within the Candid1 vaccine background did not alter the attenuated phenotype of the vaccine strain in a lethal <span class="yellow">mouse</span> model. These recombinant chimeric viruses shed light on the fundamental requirements of arenavirus GPC maturation and may serve as a strategy for the development of bivalent <span class="yellow">JUNV</span> and <span class="yellow">LASV</span> vaccine candidates. 
<h3>20980518</h3>Upregulation of CXCL10 in <span class="blue">human</span> dorsal root ganglia during experimental and natural <span class="yellow">varicella-zoster virus</span> infection. 

Varicella-zoster <span class="yellow">virus</span> (<span class="yellow">VZV</span>) reactivation causes herpes zoster, which is accompanied by an influx of lymphocytes into affected ganglia, but the stimulus for this infiltrate is not known. We report that <span class="yellow">VZV</span> infection of ganglia leads to increased CXCL10 production in vitro, in an explant ganglion model and in naturally infected dorsal root ganglia (DRG) during herpes zoster. Lymphocytes expressing the receptor for CXCL10, CXCR3, were also observed throughout naturally infected ganglia during herpes zoster, including immediately adjacent to neurons. This study identifies <span class="yellow">VZV-induced</span> CXCL10 as a potential driver of T lymphocyte recruitment into DRG during herpes zoster. 
<h3>20980524</h3>Association of TRIM22 with the type 1 interferon response and <span class="yellow">viral</span> control during primary <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span> infection. 

Type 1 interferons (IFNs) induce the expression of the tripartite interaction motif (TRIM) family of E3 ligases, but the contribution of these antiviral factors to <span class="yellow">HIV</span> pathogenesis is not completely understood. We hypothesized that the increased expression of select type 1 IFN and TRIM isoforms is associated with a significantly lower likelihood of <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span> acquisition and <span class="yellow">viral</span> control during primary <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span> infection. We measured IFN-alpha, IFN-Beta, myxovirus resistance protein <span class="yellow">A</span> (MxA), <span class="blue">human</span> TRIM5alpha (huTRIM5alpha), and TRIM22 mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of high-risk, <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span>-uninfected participants and <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span>-positive study participants. Samples were available for 32 uninfected subjects and 28 infected persons, all within 1 year of infection. <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span>-positive participants had higher levels of IFN-Beta (P = 0.0005), MxA (P = 0.007), and TRIM22 (P = 0.01) and lower levels of huTRIM5alpha (P &lt; 0.001) than did <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span>-negative participants. TRIM22 but not huTRIM5alpha correlated positively with type 1 IFN (IFN-alpha, IFN-Beta, and MxA) (all P &lt; 0.0001). In a multivariate model, increased MxA expression showed a significant positive association with <span class="yellow">viral</span> load (P = 0.0418). Furthermore, TRIM22 but not huTRIM5alpha, IFN-alpha, IFN-Beta, or MxA showed a negative correlation with plasma <span class="yellow">viral</span> load (P = 0.0307) and a positive correlation with CD4(+) T-cell counts (P = 0.0281). In vitro studies revealed that <span class="yellow">HIV</span> infection induced TRIM22 expression in PBMCs obtained from <span class="yellow">HIV</span>-negative donors. Stable TRIM22 knockdown resulted in increased <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span> particle release and replication in Jurkat reporter cells. Collectively, these data suggest concordance between type 1 IFN and TRIM22 but not huTRIM5alpha expression in PBMCs and that TRIM22 likely acts as an antiviral effector in vivo. 
<h3>21034775</h3>Cross-genotypic polyclonal <span class="yellow">anti-HCV</span><span class="yellow">HCV</span> antibodies from <span class="blue">human</span> ascitic fluid.

Many <span class="yellow">anti-HCV</span><span class="yellow">HCV</span> antibodies are available, but more are needed for research and clinical applications. This study examines whether ascitic fluid from cirrhotic patients could be a source of reagent-grade antibodies. Ascitic fluid from 29 <span class="yellow">HCV</span> patients was screened by ELISA for <span class="yellow">anti-HCV</span><span class="yellow">HCV</span> antibodies against three <span class="yellow">viral</span> proteins: core, NS4B, and NS5A. Significant patient-to-patient variability in <span class="yellow">anti-HCV</span><span class="yellow">HCV</span> antibody titers was observed. Total ascitic fluid IgG purified by Protein-A chromatography reacted with <span class="yellow">HCV</span> proteins in immunoblots, cell extracts, and replicon-expressing cells. Affinity-purification using synthetic peptides as bait allowed the preparation of cross-genotypic antibodies directed against pre-selected regions of <span class="yellow">HCV</span> core, NS4B, and NS5A proteins. The performance of the polyclonal antibodies was comparable to that of monoclonal antibodies. Anti-NS4B antibody preparations reacted with genotype 1a, 1b, and 2a NS4B proteins in immunoblots and allowed NS4B to be localized in replicon-expressing cells. Ascitic fluid is an abundant source of <span class="blue">human</span> polyclonal cross-genotypic antibodies that can be used as an alternative to blood. This study shows the utility of selectively purifying <span class="blue">human</span> polyclonal antibodies from ascitic fluid. Affinity purification allows antibodies to be selected that are comparable to monoclonal antibodies in their ability to react with targeted regions of <span class="yellow">viral</span> proteins. 
<h3>21037014</h3>Characterization of the Bacteroides CTnDOT regulatory protein RteC.

Excision of the Bacteroides conjugative transposon CTnDOT is stimulated by tetracycline. It was shown previously that a gene, rteC, is necessary for tetracycline-stimulated transcriptional regulation of the orf2c operon, which contains the excision genes. The protein encoded by this gene, RteC, did not have primary amino acid sequence homology to any known proteins in the databases. Accordingly, we sought structural homologs of RteC. <span class="yellow">A</span> three-dimensional structure prediction by Robetta suggested that RteC might have two domains and that the C-terminal domain might have a winged helix motif. Based on the Robetta prediction, the <span class="blue">human</span> transcriptional factors E2F-4 and DP2 were identified as the most likely structural homologs of RteC. We made alanine substitutions within the putative DNA binding helix 3 region of RteC. Assays of orf2c::uidA activation by alanine mutants indicated that residues 174, 175, 178, 180, and 184 in helix 3 might contact the upstream region of P(E). The upstream region of orf2c contained two inverted-repeat half sites. Mutational analysis of these half sites showed that both half sites are important for activity. Thus, we have identified the DNA binding portion of RteC and the DNA site to which it binds. 
<h3>21047956</h3>Genetic analysis of B55alpha/Cdc55 protein phosphatase 2A subunits: association with the <span class="yellow">adenovirus</span> E4orf4 protein. 

The <span class="blue">human</span><span class="yellow">human adenovirus</span> E4orf4 protein is toxic in both <span class="blue">human</span> tumor cells and <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>. Previous studies indicated that most of this toxicity is dependent on an interaction of E4orf4 protein with the B55 class of regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and in <span class="yellow">yeast</span> with the B55 homolog Cdc55. We have found previously that E4orf4 inhibits PP2A activity against at least some substrates. In an attempt to understand the mechanism of this inhibition, we used a genetic approach to identify residues in the seven-bladed Beta-propeller proteins B55alpha and Cdc55 required for E4orf4 binding. In both cases, amino-terminal polypeptides composed only of blade 1 and at least part of blade 2 were found to bind E4orf4 and overexpression blocked E4orf4 toxicity in <span class="yellow">yeast</span>. Furthermore, certain amino acid substitutions in blades 1 and 2 within full-length B55alpha and Cdc55 resulted in loss of E4orf4 binding. Recent mutational analysis has suggested that segments of blades 1 and 2 present on the top face of B55alpha form part of the &quot;substrate-binding groove.&quot; Additionally, these segments are in close proximity to the catalytic C subunit of the PP2A holoenzyme. Thus, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that E4orf4 binding could affect the access of substrates, resulting in the failure to dephosphorylate some PP2A substrates. 
<h3>21057010</h3>Biochemical characterization of UDP-Gal:GlcNAc-pyrophosphate-lipid Beta-1,4-Galactosyltransferase WfeD, a new enzyme from <span class="yellow">Shigella boydii</span> type 14 that catalyzes the second step in O-antigen repeating-unit synthesis. 

The <span class="yellow">O</span> antigen is the outer part of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and contains many repeats of an oligosaccharide unit. It contributes to antigenic variability and is essential to the full function and virulence of bacteria. Shigella is a Gram-negative <span class="blue">human</span> pathogen that causes diarrhea in <span class="yellow">humans</span>. The <span class="yellow">O</span> antigen of <span class="yellow">Shigella boydii</span> type 14 consists of repeating oligosaccharide units with the structure [->6-d-Galpalpha1->4-d-GlcpABeta1->6-d-GalpBeta1->4-d-GalpBeta1->4-d-GlcpNAcBeta1->]n. The wfeD gene in the O-antigen gene cluster of <span class="yellow">Shigella boydii</span> type 14 was proposed to encode a galactosyltransferase (GalT) involved in O-antigen synthesis. We confirmed here that the wfeD gene product is a Beta4-GalT that synthesizes the GalBeta1-4GlcNAcalpha-R linkage. WfeD was expressed in <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span>, and the activity was characterized by using UDP-[^3H]Gal as the donor substrate as well as the synthetic acceptor substrate GlcNAcalpha-pyrophosphate-(CH2)11-O-phenyl. The enzyme product was analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and galactosidase digestion. The enzyme was shown to be specific for the UDP-Gal donor substrate and required pyrophosphate in the acceptor substrate. Divalent metal ions such as Mn^2(+), Ni^2(+), and, surprisingly, also Pb^2(+) enhanced the enzyme activity. Mutational analysis showed that the Glu101 residue within a DxD motif is essential for activity, possibly by forming the catalytic nucleophile. The Lys211 residue was also shown to be required for activity and may be involved in the binding of the negatively charged acceptor substrate. Our study revealed that the Beta4-GalT WfeD is a novel enzyme that has virtually no sequence similarity to mammalian Beta4-GalT, although it catalyzes a similar reaction. 
<h3>21074391</h3>Diversity, distribution and biogeography of testate amoebae in China: implications for ecological studies in Asia. 

Testate amoebae are a group of shelled protozoa that occur in high density populations in wet environments. More than 1900 testate amoebae species or subspecies have been reported in published literature over the last 200 years, from many regions of the world. Testate amoebae are classified as Lobosea or Filosea respectively, according to the presence of lobose or filiform pseudopodia. Testate amoebae have proved an interesting group of indicator organisms in palaeoenvironmental studies and have also been used as bioindicators of <span class="blue">human</span> impact on ecosystems. Until recently, the testate amoebae of China were unknown to most western scientists, but our knowledge has improved greatly over the past 20 years. This paper summarizes the testate amoebae research in China along with relevant data from other countries in Asia, and provides the necessary context for future research. 
<h3>21084112</h3>Ebola haemorrhagic fever.

<span class="yellow">Ebola viruses</span> are the causative agents of a severe form of <span class="yellow">viral</span> haemorrhagic fever in man, designated Ebola haemorrhagic fever, and are endemic in regions of central Africa. The exception is the species <span class="yellow">Reston Ebola virus</span>, which has not been associated with <span class="blue">human</span> disease and is found in the Philippines. <span class="yellow">Ebola virus</span> constitutes an important local public health threat in Africa, with a worldwide effect through imported infections and through the fear of misuse for biological terrorism. <span class="yellow">Ebola virus</span> is thought to also have a detrimental effect on the great ape population in Africa. Case-fatality rates of the African species in man are as high as 90%, with no prophylaxis or treatment available. <span class="yellow">Ebola virus</span> infections are characterised by immune suppression and a systemic inflammatory response that causes impairment of the vascular, coagulation, and immune systems, leading to multiorgan failure and shock, and thus, in some ways, resembling septic shock. 
<h3>21118200</h3>Climatic constraints on wintering bird distributions are modified by urbanization and weather. 

1. Ecologists have long been interested in the role of climate in shaping species' ranges, and in recent years, this relationship has taken on greater significance because of the need for accurate predictions of the effects of climate change on wildlife populations. Bioclimatic relationships, however, are potentially complicated by various environmental factors operating at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Here, we test the hypothesis that climatic constraints on bird distributions are modified by species-specific responses to weather, urbanization and use of supplemental food. 2. Our analyses focused on 18 bird species with data from over 3000 sites across the north-eastern United States and adjacent Canadian provinces. We use hierarchal occupancy modelling to quantify the effects of short-term weather variation and surrounding urbanization on food stress and probabilities of detection, and how these fine-scale changes modify the role that climate has on the distributions of wintering bird populations at regional scales. 3. Examining site occupancy and supplemental food use across the study region, we found that average minimum temperature was an important factor limiting bird distributions, supporting the hypothesis that the occupancy of wintering birds is limited by climatic constraints. We found that 15 of 18 species (83%) were more energetically stressed (had a higher likelihood of visiting a feeder station) as minimum temperature declined from the seasonal average. Because we found these patterns in populations that regularly visit supplemental food sites and were likely not food-limited, we suggest that resource availability is less important than climate in constraining wintering bird distributions. Across a winter season, local within-winter extinction probabilities were lower and colonization probabilities higher at warmer sites supporting the role of climate-mediated range shifts. Importantly, however, these relationships were modified by the degree of urbanization and species' abilities to persist in <span class="blue">human</span>-modified landscapes. 4. Our results suggest that urbanization and behavioural adaptation can modify the role of climate on bird ranges and should be included in future analyses of range shifts because of climate change. 
<h3>21148732</h3>Functional and phylogenetic analysis of ureD in Shiga toxin-producing <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span>. 

Enterohemorrhagic <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span> (<span class="yellow">EHEC</span>) is a food-borne pathogen that can cause severe health complications and utilizes a much lower infectious dose than other <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> pathotypes. Despite having an intact ure locus, ureDABCEFG, the majority of <span class="yellow">EHEC</span> strains are phenotypically urease negative under tested conditions. Urease activity potentially assists with survival fitness by enhancing acid tolerance during passage through the stomach or by aiding with colonization in either <span class="blue">human</span> or animal reservoirs. Previously, in the <span class="yellow">EHEC O157:H7</span> Sakai strain, a point mutation in ureD, encoding a urease chaperone protein, was identified, resulting in a substitution of an amber stop codon for glutamine. This single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is observed in the majority of <span class="yellow">EHEC O157:H7</span> isolates and correlates with a negative urease phenotype in vitro. We demonstrate that the lack of urease activity in vitro is not solely due to the amber codon in ureD. Our analysis has identified two additional SNPs in ureD affecting amino acid positions 38 and 205, in both cases determining whether the encoded amino acid is leucine or proline. Phylogenetic analysis based on Ure protein sequences from a variety of urease-encoding bacteria demonstrates that the proline at position 38 is highly conserved among Gram-negative bacteria. Experiments reveal that the L38P substitution enhances urease enzyme activity; however, the L205P substitution does not. Multilocus sequence typing analysis for a variety of Shiga toxin-producing <span class="yellow">E. coli</span> isolates combined with the ureD sequence reveals that except for a subset of the <span class="yellow">O157:H7</span> strains, neither the in vitro urease-positive phenotype nor the ureD sequence is phylogenetically restricted. 
<h3>21163702</h3>The ribonucleotide reductase large subunit (RRM1) as a predictive factor in patients with cancer. 

The large subunit of <span class="blue">human</span> ribonucleotide reductase, RRM1, is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, cell migration, tumour and metastasis development, and the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides for DNA synthesis. It is also a cellular target for the chemotherapeutic agent, gemcitabine. RRM1 has been studied in a large number of patients with different types of cancer, such as non-small-cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and biliary tract cancer, to establish its prognostic or predictive value when patients were treated with gemcitabine, and mRNA expression and genetic variants as determined by genotyping have in some cases been associated with clinical outcome of patients with cancer. Here, we review preclinical and clinical studies of RRM1 assessment and discuss the further steps in the development of this clinically pertinent biomarker. 
<h3>21169481</h3>Antibiotics and UV radiation induce competence for natural transformation in <span class="yellow">Legionella pneumophila</span>. 

Natural transformation by competence is a major mechanism of horizontal gene transfer in bacteria. Competence is defined as the genetically programmed physiological state that enables bacteria to actively take up DNA from the environment. The conditions that signal competence development are multiple and elusive, complicating the understanding of its evolutionary significance. We used expression of the competence gene comEA as a reporter of competence development and screened several hundred molecules for their ability to induce competence in the freshwater living pathogen <span class="yellow">Legionella pneumophila</span>. We found that comEA expression is induced by chronic exposure to genotoxic molecules such as mitomycin C and antibiotics of the fluoroquinolone family. These results indicated that, in <span class="yellow">L. pneumophila</span>, competence may be a response to genotoxic stress. Sunlight-emitted UV light represents a major source of genotoxic stress in the environment and we found that exposure to UV radiation effectively induces competence development. For the first time, we show that genetic exchanges by natural transformation occur within an UV-stressed population. Genotoxic stress induces the RecA-dependent SOS response in many bacteria. However, genetic and phenotypic evidence suggest that <span class="yellow">L. pneumophila</span> lacks a prototypic SOS response and competence development in response to genotoxic stress is RecA independent. Our results strengthen the hypothesis that competence may have evolved as a DNA damage response in SOS-deficient bacteria. This parasexual response to DNA damage may have enabled <span class="yellow">L. pneumophila</span> to acquire and propagate foreign genes, contributing to the emergence of this <span class="blue">human</span> pathogen. 
<h3>21169488</h3>The sensor kinase CbrA is a global regulator that modulates metabolism, virulence, and antibiotic resistance in <span class="yellow">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>. 

<span class="yellow">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> is an opportunistic pathogen that possesses a large arsenal of virulence factors enabling the pathogen to cause serious infections in immunocompromised patients, burn victims, and cystic fibrosis patients. CbrA is a sensor kinase that has previously been implied to play a role with its cognate response regulator CbrB in the metabolic regulation of carbon and nitrogen utilization in <span class="yellow">P. aeruginosa</span>. Here it is demonstrated that CbrA and CbrB play an important role in various virulence and virulence-related processes of the bacteria, including swarming, biofilm formation, cytotoxicity, and antibiotic resistance. The cbrA deletion mutant was completely unable to swarm while exhibiting an increase in biofilm formation, supporting the inverse regulation of swarming and biofilm formation in <span class="yellow">P. aeruginosa</span>. The cbrA mutant also exhibited increased cytotoxicity to <span class="blue">human</span> lung epithelial cells as early as 4 and 6 h postinfection. Furthermore, the cbrA mutant demonstrated increased resistance toward a variety of clinically important antibiotics, including polymyxin B, ciprofloxacin, and tobramycin. Microarray analysis revealed that under swarming conditions, CbrA regulated the expression of many genes, including phoPQ, pmrAB, arnBCADTEF, dnaK, and pvdQ, consistent with the antibiotic resistance and swarming impairment phenotypes of the cbrA mutant. Phenotypic and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analyses of a PA14 cbrB mutant suggested that CbrA may be modulating swarming, biofilm formation, and cytotoxicity via CbrB and that the CrcZ small RNA is likely downstream of this two-component regulator. However, as CbrB did not have a resistance phenotype, CbrA likely modulates antibiotic resistance in a manner independent of CbrB. 
<h3>21227492</h3>Health care and equity in India.

In India, despite improvements in access to health care, inequalities are related to socioeconomic status, geography, and gender, and are compounded by high out-of-pocket expenditures, with more than three-quarters of the increasing financial burden of health care being met by households. Health-care expenditures exacerbate poverty, with about 39 million additional people falling into poverty every year as a result of such expenditures. We identify key challenges for the achievement of equity in service provision, and equity in financing and financial risk protection in India. These challenges include an imbalance in resource allocation, inadequate physical access to high-quality health services and <span class="blue">human</span> resources for health, high out-of-pocket health expenditures, inflation in health spending, and behavioural factors that affect the demand for appropriate health care. Use of equity metrics in monitoring, assessment, and strategic planning; investment in development of a rigorous knowledge base of health-systems research; development of a refined equity-focused process of deliberative decision making in health reform; and redefinition of the specific responsibilities and accountabilities of key actors are needed to try to achieve equity in health care in India. The implementation of these principles with strengthened public health and primary-care services will help to ensure a more equitable health care for India's population. 
<h3>21227494</h3>Reproductive health, and child health and nutrition in India: meeting the challenge. 

India, with a population of more than 1 billion people, has many challenges in improving the health and nutrition of its citizens. Steady declines have been noted in fertility, maternal, infant and child mortalities, and the prevalence of severe manifestations of nutritional deficiencies, but the pace has been slow and falls short of national and Millennium Development Goal targets. The likely explanations include social inequities, disparities in health systems between and within states, and consequences of urbanisation and demographic transition. In 2005, India embarked on the National Rural Health Mission, an extraordinary effort to strengthen the health systems. However, coverage of priority interventions remains insufficient, and the content and quality of existing interventions are suboptimum. Substantial unmet need for contraception remains, adolescent pregnancies are common, and access to safe abortion is inadequate. Increases in the numbers of deliveries in institutions have not been matched by improvements in the quality of intrapartum and neonatal care. Infants and young children do not get the health care they need; access to effective treatment for neonatal illness, diarrhoea, and pneumonia shows little improvement; and the coverage of nutrition programmes is inadequate. Absence of well functioning health systems is indicated by the inadequacies related to planning, financing, <span class="blue">human</span> resources, infrastructure, supply systems, governance, information, and monitoring. We provide a case for transformation of health systems through effective stewardship, decentralised planning in districts, a reasoned approach to financing that affects demand for health care, a campaign to create awareness and change health and nutrition behaviour, and revision of programmes for child nutrition on the basis of evidence. This agenda needs political commitment of the highest order and the development of a people's movement. 
<h3>21227499</h3><span class="yellow">Human</span> resources for health in India.

India has a severe shortage of <span class="blue">human</span> resources for health. It has a shortage of qualified health workers and the workforce is concentrated in urban areas. Bringing qualified health workers to rural, remote, and underserved areas is very challenging. Many Indians, especially those living in rural areas, receive care from unqualified providers. The migration of qualified allopathic doctors and nurses is substantial and further strains the system. Nurses do not have much authority or say within the health system, and the resources to train them are still inadequate. Little attention is paid during medical education to the medical and public health needs of the population, and the rapid privatisation of medical and nursing education has implications for its quality and governance. Such issues are a result of underinvestment in and poor governance of the health sector--two issues that the government urgently needs to address. <span class="yellow">A</span> comprehensive national policy for <span class="blue">human</span> resources is needed to achieve universal health care in India. The public sector will need to redesign appropriate packages of monetary and non-monetary incentives to encourage qualified health workers to work in rural and remote areas. Such a policy might also encourage task-shifting and mainstreaming doctors and practitioners who practice traditional Indian medicine (ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy, unani, and siddha) and homoeopathy to work in these areas while adopting other innovative ways of augmenting <span class="blue">human</span> resources for health. At the same time, additional investments will be needed to improve the relevance, quantity, and quality of nursing, medical, and public health education in the country. 
<h3>21269674</h3><span class="yellow">Human</span> resources for health in southeast Asia: shortages, distributional challenges, and international trade in health services. 

In this paper, we address the issues of shortage and maldistribution of health personnel in southeast Asia in the context of the international trade in health services. Although there is no shortage of health workers in the region overall, when analysed separately, five low-income countries have some deficit. All countries in southeast Asia face problems of maldistribution of health workers, and rural areas are often understaffed. Despite a high capacity for medical and nursing training in both public and private facilities, there is weak coordination between production of health workers and capacity for employment. Regional experiences and policy responses to address these challenges can be used to inform future policy in the region and elsewhere. <span class="yellow">A</span> distinctive feature of southeast Asia is its engagement in international trade in health services. Singapore and Malaysia import health workers to meet domestic demand and to provide services to international patients. Thailand attracts many foreign patients for health services. This situation has resulted in the so-called brain drain of highly specialised staff from public medical schools to the private hospitals. The Philippines and Indonesia are the main exporters of doctors and nurses in the region. Agreements about mutual recognition of professional qualifications for three groups of health workers under the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Framework Agreement on Services could result in increased movement within the region in the future. To ensure that vital <span class="blue">human</span> resources for health are available to meet the needs of the populations that they serve, migration management and retention strategies need to be integrated into ongoing efforts to strengthen health systems in southeast Asia. There is also a need for improved dialogue between the health and trade sectors on how to balance economic opportunities associated with trade in health services with domestic health needs and equity issues. 
<h3>21269682</h3>Health-financing reforms in southeast Asia: challenges in achieving universal coverage. 

In this sixth paper of the Series, we review health-financing reforms in seven countries in southeast Asia that have sought to reduce dependence on out-of-pocket payments, increase pooled health finance, and expand service use as steps towards universal coverage. Laos and Cambodia, both resource-poor countries, have mostly relied on donor-supported health equity funds to reach the poor, and reliable funding and appropriate identification of the eligible poor are two major challenges for nationwide expansion. For Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam, social health insurance financed by payroll tax is commonly used for formal sector employees (excluding Malaysia), with varying outcomes in terms of financial protection. Alternative payment methods have different implications for provider behaviour and financial protection. Two alternative approaches for financial protection of the non-poor outside the formal sector have emerged-contributory arrangements and tax-financed schemes-with different abilities to achieve high population coverage rapidly. Fiscal space and mobilisation of payroll contributions are both important in accelerating financial protection. Expanding coverage of good-quality services and ensuring adequate <span class="blue">human</span> resources are also important to achieve universal coverage. As health-financing reform is complex, institutional capacity to generate evidence and inform policy is essential and should be strengthened. 
<h3>21272794</h3>Emerging opportunistic <span class="yellow">yeast</span> infections.

A growing population of immunosuppressed patients has resulted in increasingly frequent diagnoses of invasive <span class="yellow">fungal</span> infections, including those caused by unusual <span class="yellow">yeasts</span>. The incidence of non-albicans species of Candida is increasing compared with that of <span class="yellow">Candida albicans</span>, and several species, such as <span class="yellow">Candida glabrata</span> and <span class="yellow">Candida krusei</span>, may be resistant to azole antifungal therapy. Trichosporon species are the second most common cause of fungaemia in patients with haematological malignant disease and are characterised by resistance to amphotericin and echinocandins and poor prognosis. Rhodotorula species belong to the family Cryptococcaceae, and are a cause of catheter-related fungaemia, sepsis, and invasive disease in severely immunosuppressed patients. An increasing number of sporadic cases of invasive <span class="yellow">fungal</span> infections by non-neoformans cryptococci have been reported in immunocompromised hosts, especially for patients with advanced <span class="yellow">HIV</span> infection or cancer who are undergoing transplant. Other uncommon <span class="yellow">yeasts</span> that can cause invasive disease in severely immunosuppressed patients include Geotrichum, Hansenula, Malassezia, and Saccharomyces. Host immune status is a crucial determinant of the type of invasive <span class="yellow">fungal</span> infection a patient is at risk for. Diagnosis can be challenging and relies heavily on traditional cultures of blood and other sterile sites, although serum (1,3)-Beta-D-glucan testing might have an adjunctive role. Although rare <span class="yellow">yeasts</span> are emerging as opportunistic <span class="blue">human</span> pathogens, diagnosis remains challenging and treatment suboptimal. 
<h3>21296405</h3>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an idiopathic, fatal neurodegenerative disease of the <span class="blue">human</span> motor system. In this Seminar, we summarise current concepts about the origin of the disease, what predisposes patients to develop the disorder, and discuss why all cases of ALS are not the same. In the 150 years since Charcot originally described ALS, painfully slow progress has been made towards answering these questions. We focus on what is known about ALS and where research is heading-from the small steps of extending longevity, improving therapies, undertaking clinical trials, and compiling population registries to the overarching goals of establishing the measures that guard against onset and finding the triggers for this neurodegenerative disorder. 
<h3>21320625</h3>Mechanisms of unisexual mating in <span class="yellow">Cryptococcus neoformans</span>.

Sex serves a pivotal role in genetic exchange and it contributes to the fitness and genetic diversity for eukaryotic populations. Although the importance of the canonical bisexual mating has been widely accepted, the significance of the evolution and maintenance of unisexual mating observed in some eukaryotes is unclear. The recent discovery of same-sex mating in the <span class="blue">human</span> <span class="yellow">fungal</span> pathogen <span class="yellow">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> and the revelation of its impact on the Cryptococcus global population structure provide a platform to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and significance of unisexual mating. Here, we review the evidence of unisexual mating in Cryptococcus and provide some perspective on the biological significance of this life style on the survival of this important <span class="yellow">fungal</span> pathogen in the environment and in animal hosts. We also summarize our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing this unconventional mode of reproduction. 
<h3>21361929</h3>Low functional richness and redundancy of a predator assemblage in native forest fragments of Chiloe island, Chile. 

1. Changes in land use and habitat fragmentation are major drivers of global change, and studying their effects on biodiversity constitutes a major research programme. However, biodiversity is a multifaceted concept, with a functional component linking species richness to ecosystem function. Currently, the interaction between functional and taxonomic components of biodiversity under realistic scenarios of habitat degradation is poorly understood. 2. The expected functional richness (FR)-species richness relationship (FRSR) is positive, and attenuated for functional redundancy in species-rich assemblages. Further, environmental filters are expected to flatten that association by sorting species with similar traits. Thus, analysing FRSR can inform about the response of biodiversity to environmental gradients and habitat fragmentation, and its expected functional consequences. 3. Top predators affect ecosystem functioning through prey consumption and are particularly vulnerable to changes in land use and habitat fragmentation, being good indicators of ecosystem health and suitable models for assessing the effects of habitat fragmentation on their FR. 4. Thus, this study analyses the functional redundancy of a vertebrate predator assemblage at temperate forest fragments in a rural landscape of Chiloe island (Chile), testing the existence of environmental filters by contrasting an empirically derived FRSR against those predicted from null models, and testing the association between biodiversity components and the structure of forest fragments. 5. Overall, contrasts against null models indicate that regional factors determine low levels of FR and redundancy for the vertebrate predator assemblage studied, while recorded linear FRSR indicates proportional responses of the two biodiversity components to the structure of forest fragments. Further, most species were positively associated with either fragment size or shape complexity, which are highly correlated. This, and the absence of ecological filters at the single-fragment scale, rendered taxonomically and functionally richer predator assemblages at large complex-shaped fragments. 6. These results predict strong effects of deforestation on both components of biodiversity, potentially affecting the functioning of remnants of native temperate forest ecosystems. Thus, the present study assesses general responses of functional and taxonomic components of biodiversity to a specific <span class="blue">human</span>-driven process. 
<h3>21376291</h3>Serum c testing in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer: the death knell tolls. 

Determination of the <span class="red">human</span> epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; also known as ERBB2) status of breast tumours is emphasised in various national guidelines as a necessary step for the diagnosis of breast cancer. As an alternative to tissue-based diagnostic methods, there has been substantial interest in the establishment of an easily accessible serum-based alternative that could be used for prognosis and diagnosis. Detection of serum-soluble-HER2 extracellular domain (ECD) and establishment of its potential clinical usefulness has created much debate. We assessed whether identification of circulating concentrations of HER2 ECD have clinical usefulness for management of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. We examined data from 63 studies of patients with breast cancer. Prevalence of increased concentrations varied greatly between studies. Some studies showed significant associations between raised concentrations and poor prognosis, poor response to treatments including trastuzumab, or tumour characteristics associated with aggressive disease, whereas others did not. Examination of existing data showed that concentrations of HER2 ECD are not consistently related to patient outcomes; therefore, there is insufficient evidence to support the clinical use of serum HER2 ECD testing. Design and execution of future large-scale trials to investigate the clinical use of HER2 ECD testing, in view of the progressive non-supportive evidence, is not recommended. Oncologists should continue to adhere to national guidelines for determining HER2 status. Furthermore, oncologists should continue to use clinical parameters when making decisions about initiation, continuation, and discontinuation of HER2-targeted treatments. 
<h3>21376670</h3>Towards a conceptual framework to support one-health research for policy on emerging zoonoses. 

In the past two decades there has been a growing realisation that the livestock sector was in a process of change, resulting from an expansion of intensive animal production systems and trade to meet a globalised world's increasing demand for livestock products. One unintended consequence has been the emergence and spread of transboundary animal diseases and, more specifically, the resurgence and emergence of zoonotic diseases. Concurrent with changes in the livestock sector, contact with wildlife has increased. This development has increased the risk of transmission of infections from wildlife to <span class="blue">human</span> beings and livestock. Two overarching questions arise with respect to the real and perceived threat from emerging infectious diseases: why are these problems arising with increasing frequency, and how should we manage and control them? <span class="yellow">A</span> clear conceptual research framework can provide a guide to ensure a research strategy that coherently links to the overarching goals of policy makers. We propose such a new framework in support of a research and policy-generation strategy to help to address the challenges posed by emerging zoonoses. 
<h3>21396477</h3><span class="yellow">Agrobacterium tumefasciens</span>-mediated transformation of the aquatic fungus <span class="yellow">Blastocladiella emersonii</span>. 

<span class="yellow">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span> is widely used for plant DNA transformation and more recently, has also been used to transform <span class="yellow">yeast</span>, filamentous fungi and even <span class="blue">human</span> cells. Using this technique, we developed the first transformation protocol for the saprobic aquatic fungus <span class="yellow">Blastocladiella emersonii</span>, a Blastocladiomycete localized at the base of <span class="yellow">fungal</span> phylogenetic tree, which has been shown as a promising and interesting model of study of cellular function and differentiation. We constructed binary T-DNA vectors containing hygromycin phosphotransferase (hph) or enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) genes, under the control of <span class="yellow">Aspergillus nidulans</span> trpC promoter and terminator sequences. 24 h of co-cultivation in induction medium (IM) agar plates, followed by transfer to PYG-agar plates containing cefotaxim to kill <span class="yellow">Agrobacterium tumefsciens</span> and hygromycin to select transformants, resulted in growth and sporulation of resistant transformants. Genomic DNA from the pool o resistant zoospores were shown to contain T-DNA insertion as evidenced by PCR amplification of hph gene. Using a similar protocol we could also evidence the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in zoospores derived from transformed cells. This protocol can also open new perspectives for other non-transformable closely related fungi, like the Chytridiomycete class. 
<h3>21418211</h3>Predicting diet and consumption rate differences between and within species using gut ecomorphology. 

1. Rapid environmental changes and pressing <span class="blue">human</span> needs to forecast the consequences of environmental change are increasingly driving ecology to become a predictive science. The need for effective prediction requires both the development of new tools and the refocusing of existing tools that may have previously been used primarily for purposes other than prediction. One such tool that historically has been more descriptive in nature is ecomorphology (the study of relationships between ecological roles and morphological adaptations of species and individuals). 2. Here, we examine relationships between diet and gut morphology for 15 species of brachyuran crabs, a group of pervasive and highly successful consumers for which trophic predictions would be highly valuable. 3. We show that patterns in crab stomach volume closely match some predictions of metabolic theory and demonstrate that individual diet differences and associated morphological variation reflect, at least in some instances, individual choice or diet specialization. 4. We then present examples of how stomach volume can be used to predict both the per cent herbivory of brachyuran crabs and the relative consumption rates of individual crabs. 
<h3>21477201</h3>The importance of marine vs. <span class="blue">human</span>-induced subsidies in the maintenance of an expanding mesocarnivore in the arctic tundra. 

1. Most studies addressing the causes of the recent increases and expansions of mesopredators in many ecosystems have focused on the top-down, releasing effect of extinctions of large apex predators. However, in the case of the northward expansion of the <span class="yellow">red fox</span> into the arctic tundra, a bottom-up effect of increased resource availability has been proposed, an effect that can counteract prey shortage in the low phase of the multi-annual rodent cycle. Resource subsidies both with marine and with terrestrial origins could potentially be involved. 2. During different phases of a multi-annual rodent cycle, we investigated the seasonal dynamics and spatial pattern of resource use by <span class="yellow">red foxes</span> across a coast to inland low arctic tundra gradient, Varanger Peninsula, Norway. We employed two complementary methods of diet analyses: stomach contents and stable isotope analysis. 3. We found that inland <span class="yellow">red foxes</span> primarily subsisted on <span class="yellow">reindeer</span> carrions during the low phase of a small rodent population cycle. Lemmings became the most important food item towards the peak phase of the rodent cycle, despite being less abundant than sympatric <span class="yellow">voles</span>. Isotopic signatures of tissue from both predator and prey also revealed that <span class="yellow">red foxes</span> near the coast used marine-derived subsidies in the winter, but these allochthonous resources did not spillover to adult foxes living beyond 20-25 km from the coast. 4. Although more needs to be learned about the link between increasing primary productivity due to climatic warming and trophic dynamics in tundra ecosystems, we suggest that changes in <span class="yellow">reindeer</span> management through a bottom-up effect, at least regionally, may have paved the way towards the establishment of a new mesopredator in the tundra biome. 
<h3>21526934</h3>Factors of susceptibility of <span class="blue">human</span> myiasis caused by the <span class="yellow">New World screw-worm</span>, <span class="yellow">Cochliomyia hominivorax</span> in Sao Gonsigmaalo, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 

This study was carried out between July 2007 and June 2008 and reports on the occurrence of <span class="blue">human</span> myiasis caused by the New World screwworm, <span class="yellow">Cochliomyia hominivorax</span> (Coquerel) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) in Sao Gonsigmaalo in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Liquid or solid vaseline was used to suffocate the larvae, which were then preserved in 70% ethanol and sent to the Instituto Oswaldo Cruz for identification. <span class="yellow">C. hominivorax</span> were identified in all 22 cases of myiasis. There were 12 male and 10 female patients with ages ranging from 03 to 71. Ethnically the highest incidence was among <span class="yellow">black</span> people, with 17 cases. Open wounds were the main cause of the parasitosis, whereas poor personal hygiene, the low educational level, alcoholism, bedridden patients, and physical or mental disability were possibly secondary factors; in addition to all these factors the income of the patients was very low. 
<h3>21840413</h3>The effects of dsRNA mycoviruses on growth and murine virulence of <span class="yellow">Aspergillus fumigatus</span>. 

Some isolates of the opportunistic <span class="blue">human</span> pathogenic fungus <span class="yellow">Aspergillus fumigatus</span> are known to be infected with mycoviruses. The dsRNA genomes of two of these mycoviruses, which include a chrysovirus and a partitivirus, have been completely sequenced and an RT-PCR assay for the viruses has been developed. Through curing virus-infected <span class="yellow">A. fumigatus</span> isolates by cycloheximide treatment and transfecting virus-free isolates with purified <span class="yellow">virus</span>, as checked by RT-PCR, isogenic virus-free and virus-infected lines of the fungus were generated whose phenotypes and growth have been directly compared. Mycovirus infection of <span class="yellow">A. fumigatus</span> with either the chrysovirus or the partitivirus resulted in significant aberrant phenotypic alterations and attenuation of growth of the fungus but had no effect on susceptibility to common antifungals. Chrysovirus infection of <span class="yellow">A. fumigatus</span> caused no significant alterations to murine pathogenicity. 
<h3>21907298</h3><span class="yellow">Galleria mellonella</span> as model host for the trans-kingdom pathogen <span class="yellow">Fusarium oxysporum</span>. 

<span class="yellow">Fusarium oxysporum</span>, the causal agent of vascular wilt disease, affects a wide range of plant species and can produce disseminated infections in <span class="yellow">humans</span>. <span class="yellow">F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici isolate FGSC 9935</span> causes disease both on <span class="yellow">tomato plants</span> and immunodepressed <span class="yellow">mice</span>, making it an ideal model for the comparative analysis of <span class="yellow">fungal</span> virulence on plant and animal hosts. Here we tested the ability of <span class="yellow">FGSC 9935</span> to cause disease in the <span class="yellow">greater wax moth</span> <span class="yellow">Galleria mellonella</span>, an invertebrate model host that is widely used for the study of microbial <span class="blue">human</span> pathogens. Injection of living but not of heat-killed microconidia into the hemocoel of <span class="yellow">G. mellonella</span> larvae resulted in dose-dependent killing both at 30^0C and at 37^0C. Fluorescence microscopy of larvae inoculated with a <span class="yellow">F. oxysporum transformant</span> expressing GFP revealed hyphal proliferation within the hemocoel, interaction with <span class="yellow">G. mellonella</span> hemocytes, and colonization of the killed insects by the fungus. Fungal gene knockout mutants previously tested in the <span class="yellow">tomato</span> and immunodepressed <span class="yellow">mouse</span> systems displayed a good correlation in virulence between the Galleria and the <span class="yellow">mouse</span> model. Thus, Galleria represents a useful non-vertebrate infection model for studying virulence mechanisms of <span class="yellow">F. oxysporum</span> on animal hosts. 
<h3>20796206</h3>Linking disease and community ecology through behavioural indicators: immunochallenge of <span class="yellow">white-footed mice</span> and its ecological impacts. 

1. Pathogens and immune challenges can induce changes in host phenotype in ways that indirectly impact important community interactions, including those that affect host-pathogen interactions. 2. To explore host behavioural response to immune challenge, we exposed wild <span class="yellow">white-footed mice</span> (<span class="yellow">Peromyscus leucopus</span>) to an immunogen from an endemic, zoonotic pathogen, the spirochete <span class="yellow">Borrelia burgdorferi</span>. <span class="yellow">White-footed mice</span> are a major reservoir host of Lyme disease (LD) spirochetes in northeastern USA and an abundant member of forest communities. The activity patterns, foraging behaviour, and space use of <span class="yellow">white-footed mice</span> have implications for population growth rates of community members upon which <span class="yellow">mice</span> incidentally prey (i.e. gypsy moths and native thrushes), as well as potentially determining host-vector encounter rates and <span class="blue">human</span> risk of LD. 3. Immunochallenge led to specific humoral (antibody) and cellular (i.e. elevated neutrophils and eosinophils) immune responses, supporting use of the immunogen as a surrogate for pathogenic infection. 4. Immunochallenged <span class="yellow">mice</span> had reduced wheel-running activity early in the night when measured in the lab. However, <span class="yellow">mouse</span> activity, as measured by track plates in natural field experiments, did not differ between <span class="yellow">mice</span> exposed to the immunogen and unexposed <span class="yellow">mice</span>. 5. Foraging behaviour of wild <span class="yellow">mice</span> in the field - assessed with giving-up densities of seed at artificial feeding stations - was affected by exposure to the immunogen. Whereas immunochallenge did not influence whether foraging <span class="yellow">mice</span> gained information on patch quality while foraging, it led to reductions in predator avoidance during foraging, suggesting that the proportion of space used by foraging <span class="yellow">mice</span> may be greater as a result of immunochallenge. This increased space use is predicted to increase encounter rates with patchily distributed LD vectors (ticks) and with incidental prey items. 6. Thus, immunochallenge in <span class="yellow">white-footed mice</span>, and potentially pathogenic infection, have the potential to indirectly impact community interactions, including those important for pathogen transmission. 
<h3>20840608</h3>Rarity, life history and scaling of the dynamics in time and space of British birds. 

1. Many patterns in macroecology are closely related to the total abundance of a species in a region. Here we show that interspecific differences in the pattern of population fluctuations of British bird species can be predicted from knowledge of their overall abundance and some basic life-history characteristics. 2. We identify a rarity syndrome that arises through an increased stochastic influence on population fluctuations with decreasing population size, mainly resulting from an inverse density-dependent effect of demographic stochasticity. This syndrome involves an increase in the annual changes in population size with increasing rarity in the United Kingdom. 3. The relationship between the magnitude of temporal variation and local mean population size differs between species dependent on their life history, i.e. species with larger clutch size and lower survival tended to have larger annual changes in population size than low-reproducing long-lived species. 4. The probability of local disappearance from a study plot depended on the population size and was hence closely related to the overall abundance of the species in UK. For a given population size, this probability was also related to species-specific life-history characteristics, being higher in species with larger clutch sizes and smaller survival rates. 5. Rareness results in a spatial decoupling of the temporal variation in population size. 6. These patterns show that once a species has become rare, e.g. due to <span class="blue">human</span> activities, key population dynamical characteristics will change because of density-dependent stochastic effects, which in turn are dependent on species-specific life-history characteristics. 
<h3>20880203</h3>Generation of Se-fortified <span class="yellow">broccoli</span> as functional food: impact of Se fertilization on S metabolism. 

Selenium (Se)-fortified <span class="yellow">broccoli</span> (<span class="yellow">Brassica oleracea var. italica</span>) has been proposed as a functional food for cancer prevention, based on its high glucosinolate (GSL) content and capacity for Se accumulation. However, as selenate and sulphate share the initial assimilation route, Se fertilization could interfere with sulphur metabolism and plant growth. Consequently, GSL accumulation could be compromised. To evaluate these potentially adverse effects of Se fertilization, we performed a comprehensive study on sand-grown young <span class="yellow">broccoli</span> plants (weekly selenate applications of 0.8 mumol plant(-1) via the root) and field-grown adult <span class="yellow">broccoli</span> plants during head formation (single foliar selenate application: 25.3 or 253 mumol plant(-1) ). The results show that under these conditions, Se application does not affect plant growth, contents of cysteine, glutathione, total GSL, glucoraphanin (major aliphatic GSL) or the expression of BoMYB28 (encoding a functionally confirmed master regulator for aliphatic GSL biosynthesis). Conversely, due to the changed expression of sulphate transporters (BoSULTR1;1, 1;2, 2;1, and 2;2), sulphate and total S contents increased in the shoot of young plants while decreasing in the root. We conclude that <span class="yellow">broccoli</span> can be fertilized with Se without reduction in GSL content, even with Se accumulation exceeding the level recommended for <span class="blue">human</span> consumption. 
<h3>20933542</h3>The rapid production of high-titer <span class="yellow">porcine endogenous retrovirus</span>(PERV)-B env pseudotype and construction of an EGFP-expressing replication competent <span class="yellow">PERV-A</span> vector. 

<span class="yellow">Porcine endogenous retroviruses</span> (<span class="yellow">PERVs</span>) present a unique concern associated with xenotransplantation because they have been shown to infect certain <span class="blue">human</span> cells in vitro and it is also difficult to generate herds of <span class="yellow">pigs</span> free of <span class="yellow">PERVs</span>. <span class="yellow">A</span> simple system for the production of high-titer MoMLV-PERV pseudotypes is reported; an EGFP-expressing replication-competent molecular clone that allows direct measurement of titer was also constructed. To improve the MLV-based <span class="yellow">retroviral</span> vector system, a 2.1-kb <span class="yellow">PERV</span><span class="yellow">PERV-B</span> env product was amplified from PK-15 genomic DNA and cloned into the pCL-Eco <span class="yellow">retroviral</span> vector. The titer of lacZ (<span class="yellow">PERV-B</span>) from the 293 cells was about 1.0x10(4) CFU/ml. In contrast, the titer of lacZ (PERV-B) from a conventional murine <span class="yellow">retroviral</span> vector (split genome) was found to be 1.2x10(2) CFU/ml when the <span class="yellow">PERV-B</span> env expression vector was transfected into TELCeB6 cells, which harbor MFGnlslacZ and the gag-pol-expressing vector. In addition, an infectious <span class="yellow">PERV-A</span> clone containing enhanced GFP (EGFP) by using a PCR-based method was developed. This EGFP-expressing PERV-A-IRES-EGFP molecular clone was found to be stable genetically on transfection in 293 cells. 
<h3>20958806</h3>Neuropeptide precursor gene discovery in the Chagas disease vector <span class="yellow">Rhodnius prolixus</span>. 

We show a straightforward workflow combining homology search in <span class="yellow">Rhodnius prolixus</span> genome sequence with cloning by rapid amplification of cDNA ends and mass spectrometry. We have identified 32 genes and their transcripts that encode a number of neuropeptide precursors leading to 194 putative peptides. We validated by mass spectrometry 82 of those predicted neuropeptides in the brain of <span class="yellow">R. prolixus</span> to achieve the first comprehensive genomic, transcriptomic and neuropeptidomic analysis of an insect disease vector. Comparisons of available insect neuropeptide sequences revealed that the <span class="yellow">R. prolixus</span> genome contains most of the conserved neuropeptides in insects, many of them displaying specific features at the sequence level. Some gene families reported here are identified for the first time in the order Hemiptera, a highly biodiverse group of insects that includes many <span class="blue">human</span>, animal and plant disease agents. 
<h3>20962098</h3>PB2 residue 158 is a pathogenic determinant of pandemic <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> and <span class="yellow">H5 influenza a viruses</span> in <span class="yellow">mice</span>. 

<span class="yellow">Influenza A viruses</span> are <span class="blue">human</span> and animal pathogens that cause morbidity and mortality, which range from mild to severe. The 2009 <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> pandemic was caused by the emergence of a reassortant <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> subtype (<span class="yellow">H1N1pdm</span>) <span class="yellow">influenza A virus</span> containing gene segments that originally circulated in <span class="blue">human</span>, avian, and <span class="yellow">swine</span> <span class="yellow">virus</span> reservoirs. The molecular determinants of replication and pathogenesis of <span class="yellow">H1N1pdm viruses</span> in <span class="yellow">humans</span> and other mammals are poorly understood. Therefore, we set out to elucidate <span class="yellow">viral</span> determinants critical to the pathogenesis of this novel reassortant using a <span class="yellow">mouse</span> model. We found that a glutamate-to-glycine substitution at residue 158 of the PB2 gene (PB2-E158G) increased the morbidity and mortality of the parental <span class="yellow">H1N1pdm virus</span>. Results from mini-genome replication assays in <span class="blue">human</span> cells and <span class="yellow">virus</span> titration in <span class="yellow">mouse</span> tissues demonstrated that PB2-E158G is a pathogenic determinant, because it significantly increases <span class="yellow">viral</span> replication rates. The <span class="yellow">virus</span> load in PB2-E158G-infected <span class="yellow">mouse</span> lungs was 1,300-fold higher than that of the wild-type <span class="yellow">virus</span>. Our data also show that PB2-E158G had a much stronger influence on the RNA replication and pathogenesis of <span class="yellow">H1N1pdm viruses</span> than PB2-E627K, which is a known pathogenic determinant. Remarkably, PB2-E158G substitutions also altered the pathotypes of two avian <span class="yellow">H5 viruses</span> in <span class="yellow">mice</span>, indicating that this residue impacts genetically divergent <span class="yellow">influenza A viruses</span> and suggesting that this region of PB2 could be a new antiviral target. Collectively, the data presented in this study demonstrate that PB2-E158G is a novel pathogenic determinant of <span class="yellow">influenza A viruses</span> in the <span class="yellow">mouse</span> model. We speculate that PB2-E158G may be important in the adaptation of avian PB2 genes to other mammals, and BLAST sequence analysis identified a naturally occurring <span class="blue">human</span> <span class="yellow">H1N1pdm</span> isolate that has this substitution. Therefore, future surveillance efforts should include scrutiny of this region of PB2 because of its potential impact on pathogenesis. 
<h3>20980508</h3>Norovirus GII.4 strain antigenic variation.

Noroviruses are the principal cause of epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide. Multiple reports have concluded that the major capsid proteins of GII.4 strains, which cause 80% of norovirus infections worldwide, are evolving rapidly, resulting in new epidemic strains. Surrogate neutralization assays using sera from outbreaks and from immunized <span class="yellow">mice</span> suggest that, as with <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span>, antigenic variation maintains GII.4 persistence in the face of <span class="blue">human</span> population herd immunity. To test this hypothesis, <span class="yellow">mice</span> were hyperimmunized with virus-like particles (VLPs) representing an early (GII.4-1987) and a contemporary (GII.4-2006) GII.4 strain. Anti-GII.4-1987 IgG monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) strongly reacted with GII.4 VLPs derived between only 1987 and 2002. Ligand binding blockade was more efficient with GII.4-1987 and GII.4-1997 VLPs than with GII.4-2002. Anti-GII.4-2006 IgG MAbs recognized either a broad panel of GII.4 VLPs (1987 to 2006) or a subset of contemporary (2004 to 2006) VLPs. Most 2006 antibodies did not recognize or only poorly recognized GII.4 VLPs of 2007 or 2008, documenting rapid antigenic evolution of GII.4 capsids. Generally, 2006 MAbs blocked homotypic VLP-ligand binding but were unable to block VLPs representing strains primarily circulating during or earlier than 2002. These analyses demonstrate that both subtle and significant evolutionary change has occurred within antibody epitopes between epidemic strains, providing direct evidence that the GII.4 noroviruses are undergoing antigenic variation, likely in response to herd immunity. As with <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span>, <span class="yellow">HIV</span>, and <span class="yellow">hepatitis C virus</span>, norovirus antigenic variation will significantly influence the design of efficacious vaccines and immunotherapeutics against these important <span class="blue">human</span> pathogens. 
<h3>20980519</h3>Activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells by <span class="yellow">Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus</span>. 

<span class="yellow">Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus</span> (<span class="yellow">KSHV</span>) is associated with multiple <span class="blue">human</span> malignancies, including Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman's disease. Following primary infection, <span class="yellow">KSHV</span> typically goes through a brief period of lytic replication prior to the establishment of latency. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are the major producers of type 1 interferon (IFN), primarily in response to <span class="yellow">virus</span> infection. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are key components of the innate immune system, and they serve as pathogen recognition receptors that stimulate the host antiviral response. pDCs express exclusively TLR7 and TLR9, and it is through these TLRs that the type 1 interferon response is activated in pDCs. Currently, it is not known whether <span class="yellow">KSHV</span> is recognized by pDCs and whether activation of pDCs occurs in response to <span class="yellow">KSHV</span> infection. We now report evidence that <span class="yellow">KSHV</span> can infect <span class="blue">human</span> pDCs and that pDCs are activated upon <span class="yellow">KSHV</span> infection, as measured by upregulation of CD83 and CD86 and by IFN-alpha secretion. We further show that induction of IFN-alpha occurs through activation of TLR9 signaling and that a TLR9 inhibitor diminishes the production and secretion of IFN-alpha by <span class="yellow">KSHV</span>-infected pDCs. 
<h3>21029748</h3>One-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR assays for detecting and subtyping <span class="yellow">pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009</span>, <span class="yellow">seasonal influenza A/H1N1</span>, and <span class="yellow">seasonal influenza A/H3N2 viruses</span>. 

<span class="yellow">Pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 (A/H1N1pdm) virus</span> has caused significant outbreaks worldwide. <span class="yellow">A</span> previous one-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) assay for detecting <span class="yellow">A/H1N1pdm virus</span> (H1pdm rRT-PCR assay) was improved since the former probe had a low melting temperature and low tolerance to <span class="yellow">viral</span> mutation. To help with the screening of the <span class="yellow">A/H1N1pdm virus</span>, rRT-PCR assays were also developed for detecting <span class="blue">human</span> <span class="yellow">seasonal A/H1N1</span> (H1 rRT-PCR assay) and <span class="yellow">A/H3N2 influenza viruses</span> (H3 rRT-PCR assay). H1pdm, <span class="yellow">H1</span>, and H3 rRT-PCR assays were evaluated using in vitro-transcribed control RNA, isolated viruses, and other respiratory pathogenic viruses, and were shown to have high sensitivity, good linearity (R(2)=0.99), and high specificity. In addition, the improved H1pdm rRT-PCR assay could detect two <span class="yellow">viral strains of A/H1N1pdm</span>, namely, <span class="yellow">A/Aichi/472/2009 (H1N1)pdm</span> and <span class="yellow">A/Sakai/89/2009 (H1N1)pdm</span>, which have mutation(s) in the probe-binding region of the hemagglutinin gene, without loss of sensitivity. Using the three rRT-PCR assays developed, 90 clinical specimens collected between May and October 2009 were then tested. Of these, 26, 20, and 2 samples were identified as positive for <span class="yellow">A/H1pdm</span>, <span class="yellow">A/H3</span>, and <span class="yellow">A/H1</span>, respectively, while 42 samples were negative for <span class="yellow">influenza A viruses</span>. The present results suggest that these highly sensitive and specific H1pdm, <span class="yellow">H1</span>, and H3 rRT-PCR assays are useful not only for diagnosing <span class="yellow">influenza viruses</span>, but also for the surveillance of <span class="yellow">influenza viruses</span>. 
<h3>21034773</h3>Comparison of commercial systems for extraction of nucleic acids from DNA/RNA respiratory pathogens. 

This study compared six automated nucleic acid extraction systems and one manual kit for their ability to recover nucleic acids from <span class="blue">human</span> nasal wash specimens spiked with five respiratory pathogens, representing Gram-positive bacteria (<span class="yellow">Streptococcus pyogenes</span>), Gram-negative bacteria (<span class="yellow">Legionella pneumophila</span>), DNA viruses (adenovirus), segmented RNA viruses (<span class="yellow">human influenza virus A</span>), and non-segmented RNA viruses (<span class="yellow">respiratory syncytial virus</span>). The robots and kit evaluated represent major commercially available methods that are capable of simultaneous extraction of DNA and RNA from respiratory specimens, and included platforms based on magnetic-bead technology (KingFisher mL, Biorobot EZ1, easyMAG, KingFisher Flex, and MagNA Pure Compact) or glass fiber filter technology (Biorobot MDX and the manual kit Allprep). All methods yielded extracts free of cross-contamination and RT-PCR inhibition. All automated systems recovered <span class="yellow">L. pneumophila</span> and <span class="yellow">adenovirus</span> DNA equivalently. However, the MagNA Pure protocol demonstrated more than 4-fold higher DNA recovery from the <span class="yellow">S. pyogenes</span> than other methods. The KingFisher mL and easyMAG protocols provided 1- to 3-log wider linearity and extracted 3- to 4-fold more RNA from the <span class="yellow">human influenza virus</span> and <span class="yellow">respiratory syncytial virus</span>. These findings suggest that systems differed in nucleic acid recovery, reproducibility, and linearity in a pathogen specific manner. 
<h3>21047957</h3>Modification of nonstructural protein 1 of <span class="yellow">influenza A virus</span> by SUMO1.

Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is one of the major factors resulting in the efficient infection rate and high level of virulence of <span class="yellow">influenza A virus</span>. Although consisting of only approximately 230 amino acids, NS1 has the ability to interfere with several systems of the host <span class="yellow">viral</span> defense. In the present study, we demonstrate that NS1 of the highly pathogenic avian <span class="yellow">influenza</span> <span class="yellow">A/Duck/Hubei/L-1/2004 (H5N1) virus</span> interacts with <span class="blue">human</span> Ubc9, which is the E2 conjugating enzyme for sumoylation, and we show that SUMO1 is conjugated to <span class="yellow">H5N1</span> NS1 in both transfected and infected cells. Furthermore, two lysine residues in the C terminus of NS1 were identified as SUMO1 acceptor sites. When the SUMO1 acceptor sites were removed by mutation, NS1 underwent rapid degradation. Studies of different <span class="yellow">influenza A virus</span> strains of <span class="blue">human</span> and avian origin showed that the majority of viruses possess an NS1 protein that is modified by SUMO1, except for the recently emerged <span class="yellow">swine-origin influenza A virus (S-OIV) (H1N1)</span>. Interestingly, growth of a sumoylation-deficient WSN <span class="yellow">virus</span> mutant was retarded compared to that of wild-type <span class="yellow">virus</span>. Together, these results indicate that sumoylation enhances NS1 stability and thus promotes rapid growth of <span class="yellow">influenza A virus</span>. 
<h3>21115658</h3>Interbacterial macromolecular transfer by the <span class="yellow">Campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis</span> type IV secretion system. 

We report here the first demonstration of intra- and interspecies conjugative plasmid DNA transfer for <span class="yellow">Campylobacter fetus</span>. Gene regions carried by a <span class="yellow">Campylobacter coli</span> plasmid were identified that are sufficient for conjugative mobilization to <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span> and <span class="yellow">C. fetus</span> recipients. <span class="yellow">A</span> broader functional range is predicted. Efficient DNA transfer involves the virB9 and virD4 genes of the type IV bacterial secretion system encoded by a pathogenicity island of <span class="yellow">C. fetus subsp. venerealis</span>. Complementation of these phenotypes from expression constructions based on the promoter of the <span class="yellow">C. fetus</span> surface antigen protein (sap) locus was temperature dependent, and a temperature regulation of the sap promoter was subsequently confirmed under laboratory conditions. Gene transfer was sensitive to surface or entry exclusion functions in potential recipient cells carrying IncPalpha plasmid RP4 implying functional relatedness to <span class="yellow">C. fetus</span> proteins. The virB/virD4 locus is also known to be involved in bacterial invasion and killing of cultured <span class="blue">human</span> cells in vitro. Whether specifically secreted effector proteins contribute to host colonization and infection activities is currently unknown. Two putative effector proteins carrying an FIC domain conserved in a few bacterial type III and type IV secreted proteins of pathogens were analyzed for secretion by the <span class="yellow">C. fetus</span> or heterologous conjugative systems. No evidence for interbacterial translocation of the Fic proteins was found. 
<h3>21126914</h3>Tracking a century of global expansion and evolution of <span class="yellow">HIV</span> to drive understanding and to combat disease. 

Since the isolation of <span class="yellow">HIV</span>, multiple transmissions are thought to have occurred between man and other old-world primates. Assessment of samples from apes and <span class="blue">human</span> beings with African equatorial forest ancestry has traced the origin of <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span> to <span class="yellow">chimpanzees</span>, and dated its most recent common ancestor to 1908. The evolution of <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span> has been rapid, which has resulted in a complex classification, worldwide spread, and intermixing of strains; at least 48 circulating recombinant forms are currently identified. In addition to posing a nearly insurmountable challenge for diagnosis, treatment, vaccine development, and prevention, this extreme and divergent evolution has led to differences in virulence between <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span> groups, subtypes, or both. Coincidental changes in <span class="blue">human</span> migration in the Congo river basin also affected spread of disease. Research over the past 25 years and advances in genomic sequencing methods, such as deep DNA sequencing, have greatly improved understanding and analysis of the thousands to millions of full infectious <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span> genomes. 
<h3>21227489</h3>Towards achievement of universal health care in India by 2020: a call to action. 

To sustain the positive economic trajectory that India has had during the past decade, and to honour the fundamental right of all citizens to adequate health care, the health of all Indian people has to be given the highest priority in public policy. We propose the creation of the Integrated National Health System in India through provision of universal health insurance, establishment of autonomous organisations to enable accountable and evidence-based good-quality health-care practices and development of appropriately trained <span class="blue">human</span> resources, the restructuring of health governance to make it coordinated and decentralised, and legislation of health entitlement for all Indian people. The key characteristics of our proposal are to strengthen the public health system as the primary provider of promotive, preventive, and curative health services in India, to improve quality and reduce the out-of-pocket expenditure on health care through a well regulated integration of the private sector within the national health-care system. Dialogue and consensus building among the stakeholders in the government, civil society, and private sector are the next steps to formalise the actions needed and to monitor their achievement. In our call to action, we propose that India must achieve health care for all by 2020. 
<h3>21397712</h3>Npc1 is involved in sterol trafficking in the filamentous fungus <span class="yellow">Fusarium graminearum</span>. 

The ortholog of the <span class="blue">human</span> gene NPC1 was identified in the plant pathogenic, filamentous fungus <span class="yellow">Fusarium graminearum</span> by shared amino acid sequence, protein domain structure and cellular localization of the mature <span class="yellow">fungal</span> protein. The FusariumNpc1 gene shares 34% amino acid sequence identity and 51% similarity to the <span class="blue">human</span> gene, has similar domain structure and is constitutively expressed, although up-regulated in ungerminated macroconidia and ascospores. GFP-tagged Npc1p localizes to the <span class="yellow">fungal</span> vacuolar membrane. Cultures derived from a Deltanpc1 mutant strain contain significantly more ergosterol than cultures of the wildtype. Staining with the fluorescent, sterol binding dye filipin, shows that ergosterol accumulates in vacuoles of the Deltanpc1 mutant but not the wildtype strain. The Deltanpc1 mutant has a temperature dependent reduction in growth and greater sensitivity to the ergosterol synthesis inhibiting fungicide tebuconazole compared with the wildtype strain or the mutant complemented with wildtype Npc1. The mutant also is significantly reduced in pathogenicity to <span class="yellow">wheat</span>. Our results are consistent with the interpretation that Npc1p is important for normal transport of ergosterol from the vacuole and is essential for proper membrane function under particular environmental conditions. 
<h3>21474174</h3>Priority actions for the non-communicable disease crisis.

The UN High-Level Meeting on Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) in September, 2011, is an unprecedented opportunity to create a sustained global movement against premature death and preventable morbidity and disability from NCDs, mainly heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory disease. The increasing global crisis in NCDs is a barrier to development goals including poverty reduction, health equity, economic stability, and <span class="blue">human</span> security. The Lancet NCD Action Group and the NCD Alliance propose five overarching priority actions for the response to the crisis--leadership, prevention, treatment, international cooperation, and monitoring and accountability--and the delivery of five priority interventions--<span class="yellow">tobacco</span> control, salt reduction, improved diets and physical activity, reduction in hazardous alcohol intake, and essential drugs and technologies. The priority interventions were chosen for their health effects, cost-effectiveness, low costs of implementation, and political and financial feasibility. The most urgent and immediate priority is <span class="yellow">tobacco</span> control. We propose as a goal for 2040, a world essentially free from <span class="yellow">tobacco</span> where less than 5% of people use <span class="yellow">tobacco</span>. Implementation of the priority interventions, at an estimated global commitment of about US$9 billion per year, will bring enormous benefits to social and economic development and to the health sector. If widely adopted, these interventions will achieve the global goal of reducing NCD death rates by 2% per year, averting tens of millions of premature deaths in this decade. 
<h3>21699592</h3>Characterization of the oxysterol-binding protein gene family in the <span class="yellow">yellow fever mosquito</span>, <span class="yellow">Aedes aegypti</span>. 

The oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) and OSBP-related proteins (ORPs) are sterol-binding proteins that may be involved in cellular sterol transportation, sterol metabolism and signal transduction pathways. Four ORP genes were cloned from <span class="yellow">Aedes aegypti</span>. Based on amino acid sequence homology to <span class="blue">human</span> proteins, they are AeOSBP, AeORP1, AeORP8 and AeORP9. Splicing variants of AeOSBP and AeORP8 were identified. The temporal and spatial transcription patterns of members of the AeOSBP gene family through developmental stages and the gonotrophic cycle were profiled. AeORP1 transcription seemed to be head tissue-specific, whereas AeOSBP and AeORP9 expression was induced by a bloodmeal. Furthermore, over-expression of AeORPs facilitated [(3)H]-cholesterol uptake in <span class="yellow">Ae. aegypti</span> cultured Aag -2 cells. 
<h3>21906194</h3>Prolixicin: a novel antimicrobial peptide isolated from <span class="yellow">Rhodnius prolixus</span> with differential activity against bacteria and <span class="yellow">Trypanosoma cruzi</span>. 

We identified and characterized the activity of prolixicin, a novel antimicrobial peptide (AMP) isolated from the hemipteran insect, <span class="yellow">Rhodnius prolixus</span>. Sequence analysis reveals one region of prolixicin that may be related to the diptericin/attacin family of AMPs. Prolixicin is an 11-kDa peptide containing a putative 21 amino acid signal peptide, two putative phosphorylation sites and no glycosylation sites. It is produced by both adult fat body and midgut tissues in response to bacterial infection of the haemolymph or the midgut. Unlike most insect antibacterial peptides, the prolixicin gene does not seem to be regulated by NF-kappaB binding sites, but its promoter region contains several GATA sites. Recombinant prolixicin has strong activity against the Gram-negative bacterium <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span> and differential activity against several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. No significant toxicity was demonstrated against <span class="yellow">Trypanosoma cruzi</span>, the <span class="blue">human</span> parasite transmitted by <span class="yellow">R. prolixus</span>. 
<h3>20946419</h3>Stable isotope labelling and zinc distribution in grains studied by laser ablation ICP-MS in an ear culture system reveals zinc transport barriers during grain filling in <span class="yellow">wheat</span>. 

Zinc (Zn) deficiency has been recognized as a potential risk for <span class="blue">human</span> health in many developing regions where staple food with low micronutrient density represents a major proportion of the diet. The success of strategies to increase Zn content in the edible part of crops requires better understanding of Zn transport to, and distribution within, the grains. The transfer of Zn from the growth medium to <span class="yellow">wheat</span> (<span class="yellow">Triticum aestivum</span>) grains in an ear culture system was investigated by using the stable Zn isotope (70) Zn, and the spatial distribution of Zn within the grains was studied by laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Zinc was readily transported in the stem up to the rachis. More Zn accumulated in the stem when higher amounts of Zn were supplied to the medium. Once Zn was transported into the grain, Zn accumulated particularly in the crease vascular tissue. The gradient of (70) Zn concentration between crease vascular tissue, aleurone layer and endosperm demonstrates that Zn is distributed within grain through the crease phloem. These results suggest that two barriers of Zn transport into <span class="yellow">wheat</span> grains may exist: between the stem tissue rachis and the grain, and the maternal and filial tissues in the grain. 
<h3>20962081</h3><span class="yellow">Varicella-zoster virus</span> glycoprotein E is a critical determinant of virulence in the SCID mouse-<span class="blue">human</span> model of neuropathogenesis. 

<span class="yellow">Varicella-zoster virus</span> (<span class="yellow">VZV</span>) is a neurotropic alphaherpesvirus. <span class="yellow">VZV</span> infection of <span class="blue">human</span> dorsal root ganglion (DRG) xenografts in immunodeficient <span class="yellow">mice</span> models the infection of sensory ganglia. We examined DRG infection with recombinant <span class="yellow">VZV</span> (recombinant Oka [rOka]) and the following gE mutants: gEDelta27-90, gEDeltaCys, gE-AYRV, and gE-SSTT. gEDelta27-90, which lacks the gE domain that interacts with a putative receptor insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), replicated as extensively as rOka, producing infectious virions and significant cytopathic effects within 14 days of inoculation. Since neural cells express IDE, the gE/IDE interaction was dispensable for <span class="yellow">VZV</span> neurotropism. In contrast, gEDeltaCys, which lacks gE/gI heterodimer formation, was significantly impaired at early times postinfection; <span class="yellow">viral</span> genome copy numbers increased slowly, and infectious <span class="yellow">virus</span> production was not detected until day 28. Delayed replication was associated with impaired cell-cell spread in ganglia, similar to the phenotype of a gI deletion mutant (rOkaDeltagI). However, at later time points, infection of satellite cells and other supportive nonneuronal cells resulted in extensive DRG tissue damage and cell loss such that cytopathic changes observed at day 70 were more severe than those for rOka-infected DRG. The replication of gE-AYRV, which is impaired for trans-Golgi network (TGN) localization, and the replication of gE-SSTT, which contains mutations in an acidic cluster, were equivalent to that of rOka, causing significant cytopathic effects and infectious <span class="yellow">virus</span> production by day 14; genome copy numbers were equivalent to those of rOka. These experiments suggest that the gE interaction with cellular IDE, gE targeting to TGN sites of virion envelopment, and phosphorylation at SSTT are dispensable for <span class="yellow">VZV</span> DRG infection, whereas the gE/gI interaction is critical for <span class="yellow">VZV</span> neurovirulence. 
<h3>20980505</h3>Translational control of the abundance of cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein in <span class="yellow">human cytomegalovirus</span>-infected cells. 

Irrespective of their effects on ongoing host protein synthesis, productive replication of the representative alphaherpesvirus <span class="yellow">herpes simplex virus type 1</span>, the representative gammaherpesvirus <span class="yellow">Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus</span>, and the representative betaherpesvirus <span class="yellow">human cytomegalovirus</span> [<span class="yellow">HCMV</span>] stimulates the assembly of the multisubunit, cap-binding translation factor eIF4F. However, only <span class="yellow">HCMV</span> replication is associated with an increased abundance of eIF4F core components (eIF4E, eIF4G, eIF4A) and the eIF4F-associated factor poly(A) binding protein (PABP). Here, we demonstrate that the increase in translation factor concentration was readily detected in an asynchronous population of <span class="yellow">HCMV</span>-infected primary <span class="blue">human</span> fibroblasts, abolished by prior UV inactivation of <span class="yellow">virus</span>, and genetically dependent upon <span class="yellow">viral</span> immediate-early genes. Strikingly, while increased mRNA steady-state levels accompanied the rise in eIF4E and eIF4G protein levels, the overall abundance of PABP mRNA, together with the half-life of the polypeptide it encodes, remained relatively unchanged by <span class="yellow">HCMV</span> infection. Instead, <span class="yellow">HCMV</span>-induced PABP accumulation resulted from new protein synthesis and was sensitive to the mTORC1-selective inhibitor rapamycin, which interferes with phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrate p70 S6K and the translational repressor 4E-BP1. While virus-induced PABP accumulation did not require p70 S6K, it was inhibited by the expression of a dominant-acting 4E-BP1 variant unable to be inactivated by mTORC1. Finally, unlike the situation in alpha- or gammaherpesvirus-infected cells, where PABP is redistributed to nuclei, PABP accumulated in the cytoplasm of <span class="yellow">HCMV</span>-infected cells. Thus, cytoplasmic PABP accumulation is translationally controlled in <span class="yellow">HCMV</span>-infected cells via a mechanism requiring mTORC1-mediated inhibition of the cellular 4E-BP1 translational repressor. 
<h3>20980506</h3>A new model of <span class="yellow">Epstein-Barr virus</span> infection reveals an important role for earlylytic <span class="yellow">viral</span> protein expression in the development of lymphomas.

<span class="yellow">Epstein-Barr virus</span> (<span class="yellow">EBV</span>) infects cells in latent or lytic forms, but the roleof lytic infection in <span class="yellow">EBV</span>-induced lymphomas is unclear. Here, we have used anew humanized <span class="yellow">mouse</span> model, in which both <span class="blue">human</span> fetal CD34(+) hematopoietic stemcells and thymus/liver tissue are transplanted, to compare <span class="yellow">EBV</span> pathogenesis andlymphoma formation following infection with a lytic replication-defectiveBZLF1-deleted (Z-KO) <span class="yellow">virus</span> or a lytically active BZLF1(+) control. Both thecontrol and Z-KO viruses established long-term <span class="yellow">viral</span> latency in all infectedanimals. The infection appeared well controlled in some animals, but otherseventually developed CD20(+) diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL). Animalsinfected with the control <span class="yellow">virus</span> developed tumors more frequently than Z-KOvirus-infected animals. Specific immune responses against <span class="yellow">EBV</span>-infected B cellswere generated in <span class="yellow">mice</span> infected with either the control <span class="yellow">virus</span> or the Z-KOvirus. In both cases, forms of <span class="yellow">viral</span> latency (type I and type IIB) wereobserved that are less immunogenic than the highly transforming form (type III)commonly found in tumors of immunocompromised hosts, suggesting that immunepressure contributed to the outcome of the infection. These results point to animportant role for lytic <span class="yellow">EBV</span> infection in the development of B cell lymphomasin the context of an active host immune response.
<h3>21097617</h3>Isolation and characterization of P1 adhesin, a leg protein of the gliding bacterium <span class="yellow">Mycoplasma pneumoniae</span>. 

<span class="yellow">Mycoplasma pneumoniae</span>, a pathogen causing <span class="blue">human</span> pneumonia, binds to solid surfaces at its membrane protrusion and glides by a unique mechanism. In this study, P1 adhesin, which functions as a &quot;leg&quot; in gliding, was isolated from <span class="yellow">mycoplasma</span> culture and characterized. Using gel filtration, blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE), and chemical cross-linking, the isolated P1 adhesin was shown to form a complex with an accessory protein named P90. The complex included two molecules each of P1 adhesin and P90 (protein B), had a molecular mass of about 480 kDa, and was observed by electron microscopy to form 20-nm-diameter spheres. Partial digestion of isolated P1 adhesin by trypsin showed that the P1 adhesin molecule can be divided into three domains, consistent with the results from trypsin treatment of the cell surface. Sequence analysis of P1 adhesin and its orthologs showed that domain I is well conserved and that a transmembrane segment exists near the link between domains II and III. 
<h3>21155772</h3>The Serengeti food web: empirical quantification and analysis of topological changes under increasing <span class="blue">human</span> impact. 

1. To address effects of land use and <span class="blue">human</span> overexploitation on wildlife populations, it is essential to better understand how <span class="blue">human</span> activities have changed species composition, diversity and functioning. Theoretical studies modelled how network properties change under <span class="blue">human</span>-induced, non-random species loss. However, we lack data on realistic species-loss sequences in threatened, real-world food webs to parameterize these models. 2. Here, we present a first size-structured topological food web of one of the most pristine terrestrial ecosystems in the world, the Serengeti ecosystem (Tanzania). The food web consists of 95 grouped nodes and includes both invertebrates and vertebrates ranging from body masses between 10(-7) and 10(4) kg. 3. We study the topological changes in this food web that result from the simulated IUCN-based species-loss sequence representing current species vulnerability to <span class="blue">human</span> disturbances in and around this savanna ecosystem. We then compare this realistic extinction scenario with other extinction sequences based on body size and connectance and perform an analysis of robustness of this savanna food web. 4. We demonstrate that real-world species loss in this case starts with the biggest (mega) herbivores and top predators, causing higher predator-prey mass ratios. However, unlike theoretically modelled linear species deletion sequences, this causes poor-connected species to be lost first, while more highly connected species become lost as <span class="blue">human</span> impact progresses. This food web shows high robustness to decreasing body size and increasing connectance deletion sequences compared with a high sensitivity to the decreasing connectance deletion scenario. 5. Furthermore, based on the current knowledge of the Serengeti ecosystem, we discuss how the focus on food web topology alone, disregarding nontrophic interactions, may lead to an underestimation of <span class="blue">human</span> impacts on wildlife communities, with the number of trophic links affected by a factor of two. 6. This study underlines the importance of integrative efforts between the development of food web theory and basic field work approaches in the quantification of the structure of interaction networks to sustain natural ecosystems in a changing world.
