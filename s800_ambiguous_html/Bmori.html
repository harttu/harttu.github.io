<h2>B. mori</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21091811</h3>Candidate chemosensory ionotropic receptors in a Lepidoptera.<br><br>A new family of candidate chemosensory ionotropic receptors (IRs) related to ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) was recently discovered in <span class="annotated ">Drosophila melanogaster</span>. Through Blast analyses of an expressed sequenced tag library prepared from male antennae of the noctuid <span class="linneaus_only ">moth</span> <span class="annotated ">Spodoptera littoralis</span>, we identified 12 unigenes encoding proteins related to <span class="annotated ">D. melanogaster</span> and <span class="annotated ">Bombyx mori</span> IRs. Their full length sequences were obtained and the analyses of their expression patterns suggest that they were exclusively expressed or clearly enriched in chemosensory organs. The deduced protein sequences were more similar to <span class="match annotated ">B. mori</span> and <span class="annotated ">D. melanogaster</span> IRs than to iGluRs and showed considerable variations in the predicted ligand-binding domains; none have the three glutamate-interacting residues found in iGluRs, suggesting different binding specificities. Our data suggest that we identified members of the insect IR chemosensory receptor family in <span class="annotated ">S. littoralis</span> and we report here the first demonstration of IR expression in Lepidoptera. 
<h3>21199020</h3>Genetic analysis of the xenobiotic resistance-associated ABC gene subfamilies of the Lepidoptera. <br><br>Some ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters of subfamilies B, C and G confer resistance to xenobiotics including insecticides. We identified genes of these subfamilies expressed by the lepidopterans <span class="annotated ">Trichoplusia ni</span> and <span class="annotated ">Bombyx mori</span>. The <span class="match annotated ">B. mori</span> genome includes eight, six and 13 ABC-B, -C and -G genes, respectively, which encode P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance protein, MRP, and breast cancer resistance protein, BCRP, homologues. Among the ABC-C and -G subfamilies, gene duplication contributes to protein diversity. We have identified three ABC-B and two ABC-C <span class="annotated ">T. ni</span> genes. Analyses of the <span class="annotated ">T. ni</span> MRP (TrnMRP) revealed unique features, including the potential for TrnMRP4 hyperglycosylation and the alternative splicing of TrnMRP1. Taken together, these attributes of <span class="linneaus_only ">moth</span> multidrug resistance-associated ABCs may confer distinct functional capacities to xenobiotic efflux.
