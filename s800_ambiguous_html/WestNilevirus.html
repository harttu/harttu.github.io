<h2>West Nile virus</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20980507</h3>Successful vaccination strategies that protect aged <span class="yellow">mice</span> from lethal challenge from <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span> and heterologous <span class="yellow">severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus</span>. <br><br>Newly emerging viruses often circulate as a heterogeneous swarm in wild animal reservoirs prior to their emergence in <span class="yellow">humans</span>, and their antigenic identities are often unknown until an outbreak situation. The newly emerging <span class="yellow">severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus</span> (<span class="yellow">SARS-CoV</span>) and reemerging <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span> cause disproportionate disease in the aged, who are also notoriously difficult to successfully vaccinate, likely due to immunosenescence. To protect against future emerging strains, vaccine platforms should induce broad cross-reactive immunity that is sufficient to protect from homologous and heterologous challenge in all ages. From initial studies, we hypothesized that attenuated <span class="yellow">Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus</span> (<span class="yellow">VEE</span>) replicon particle (VRP) vaccine glycoproteins mediated vaccine failure in the aged. We then compared the efficacies of vaccines bearing attenuated (VRP(3014)) or wild-type <span class="yellow">VEE</span> glycoproteins (VRP(3000)) in young and aged <span class="yellow">mice</span> within novel models of severe <span class="yellow">SARS-CoV</span> pathogenesis. Aged animals receiving VRP(3000)-based vaccines were protected from <span class="yellow">SARS-CoV</span> disease, while animals receiving the VRP(3014)-based vaccines were not. The superior protection for the aged observed with VRP(3000)-based vaccines was confirmed in a lethal <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span> challenge model. While the VRP(3000) vaccine's immune responses in the aged were sufficient to protect against lethal homologous and heterologous challenge, our data suggest that innate defects within the VRP(3014) platform mediate vaccine failure. Exploration into the mechanism(s) of successful vaccination in the immunosenescent should aid in the development of successful vaccine strategies for other <span class="yellow">viral</span> diseases disproportionately affecting the elderly, like <span class="blue">West Nile virus</span>, <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span>, norovirus, or other emerging viruses of the future. 
<h3>20974180</h3>Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) antibody-based assays to differentiate <span class="yellow">West Nile</span> (WN) <span class="yellow">virus</span> from <span class="yellow">Japanese encephalitis virus</span> infections in horses: effects of <span class="yellow">WN virus</span> NS1 antibodies induced by inactivated <span class="yellow">WN</span> vaccine. <br><br>Antibodies to non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of <span class="red">West Nile virus</span> (WNV) have been used to differentiate <span class="yellow">WNV</span> infection from infection by serologically cross-reactive flaviviruses, including <span class="yellow">Japanese encephalitis virus</span> (JEV), in <span class="yellow">horses</span>. However, since the inactivated <span class="yellow">West Nile</span> (<span class="yellow">WN</span>) vaccine has been reported to induce NS1 antibodies, there is concern about the reliability of using NS1-based assays for testing vaccinated <span class="yellow">horses</span>. Therefore, the effect of inactivated <span class="yellow">WN</span> vaccine-induced antibodies on an epitope-blocking ELISA and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) assay were investigated. Both assays are based on NS1 antibodies and were established previously to differentiate <span class="yellow">WNV</span> from <span class="yellow">JEV</span> infections in <span class="yellow">horses</span>. Groups of three <span class="yellow">horses</span> were vaccinated with two or three doses of a commercial inactivated <span class="yellow">WN</span> vaccine and NS1 antibodies were detected by a conventional ELISA after the second vaccination. Vaccine-induced NS1 antibodies were also detected by blocking ELISA and a CDC assay and affected the ability of these assays to differentiate <span class="yellow">WNV</span> from <span class="yellow">JEV</span> infections. However, the effect was less significant in the CDC assay, where use of a low serum concentration ensured effective differentiation. The more efficient detection of infection-induced antibodies over vaccine-induced antibodies by the CDC assay was potentially attributable to the different IgG isotype profiles of these antibodies.
