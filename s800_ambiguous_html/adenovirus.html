<h2>Adenovirus</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20980503</h3><span class="blue">Adenovirus</span> membrane penetration activates the NLRP3 inflammasome.

<span class="yellow">Adenovirus type 5</span> (<span class="yellow">Ad5</span>) infection of macrophages results in rapid secretion of interleukin-1Beta (IL-1Beta) and is dependent on the inflammasome components NLRP3 and ASC and the catalytic activity of caspase-1. Using lentivirus-expressed short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and competitive inhibitors, we show that Ad-induced IL-1Beta release is dependent upon Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) sensing of the <span class="yellow">Ad5</span> double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome in <span class="yellow">human</span> cell lines and primary monocyte-derived macrophages but not in <span class="yellow">mouse</span> macrophages. Additionally, a temperature-sensitive mutant of <span class="yellow">Ad5</span> unable to penetrate endosomal membranes, ts1, is unable to induce IL-1Beta release in TLR2-primed THP-1 cells, suggesting that penetration of endosomal membranes is required for IL-1Beta release. Disruption of lysosomal membranes and the release of cathepsin B into the cytoplasm are required for <span class="yellow">Ad</span>-induced NLRP3 activation. <span class="yellow">Ad5</span> cell entry also induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and inhibitors of ROS prevent <span class="yellow">Ad</span>-induced IL-1Beta release. <span class="yellow">Ad5</span> activation of NLRP3 also induces necrotic cell death, resulting in the release of the proinflammatory molecule HMGB1. This work further defines the mechanisms of virally induced inflammasome activation.
