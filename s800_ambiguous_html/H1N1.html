The pandemic <b>H1N1</b> ( H1N1pdm ) virus is the predominant SB__influenza SI__virus strain in the SB__human population .

More importantly , vaccination of pigs with a ty / 04 att - <b>H1N1</b> vaccine candidate resulted in sterilizing immunity upon an aggressive intratracheal challenge with the 2009 <b>H1N1</b> pandemic virus . 
</br>
The validation of a real - time RT - PCR assay which detects influenza A and types simultaneously for SB__influenza SI__A SI__H1N1 ( 2009 ) and oseltamivir - resistant ( H275Y ) influenza A <b>H1N1</b> ( 2009 ) . 
</br>
Influenza A <b>H1N1</b> ( 2009 ) was declared by the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) as the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century . 
</br>
Rapid detection of influenza A and differentiation of influenza A <b>H1N1</b> ( 2009 ) and seasonal influenza A is beneficial . 
</br>
In addition the rapid detection of antiviral resistant strains of influenza A <b>H1N1</b> ( 2009 ) would be useful for clinicians to allow for change to an effective treatment at a much earlier stage if resistance is found .
