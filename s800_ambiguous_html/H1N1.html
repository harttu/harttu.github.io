<h2>H1N1</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20962084</h3>Modifications in the polymerase genes of a <span class="annotated ">swine</span>-like triple-reassortant <span class="annotated ">influenza virus</span> to generate live attenuated vaccines against 2009 pandemic <span class="annotated ">H1N1 viruses</span>. <br><br>On 11 June 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the outbreaks caused by novel <span class="annotated ">swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus</span> had reached pandemic proportions. The pandemic <span class="match unannotated ">H1N1</span> (H1N1pdm) <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> is the predominant <span class="annotated ">influenza virus</span> strain in the <span class="annotated ">human</span> population. It has also crossed the species barriers and infected turkeys and <span class="annotated ">swine</span> in several countries. Thus, the development of a vaccine that is effective in multiple animal species is urgently needed. We have previously demonstrated that the introduction of temperature-sensitive mutations into the PB2 and PB1 genes of an avian <span class="annotated ">H9N2 virus</span>, combined with the insertion of a hemagglutinin (HA) tag in PB1, resulted in an attenuated (att) vaccine backbone for both <span class="annotated ">chickens</span> and <span class="unannotated ">mice</span>. Because the new pandemic strain is a triple-reassortant (TR) <span class="unannotated ">virus</span>, we chose to introduce the double attenuating modifications into a <span class="annotated ">swine</span>-like TR <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> isolate, <span class="annotated ">A/turkey/OH/313053/04 (H3N2)</span> (ty/04), with the goal of producing live attenuated <span class="unannotated ">influenza</span> vaccines (LAIV). This genetically modified backbone had impaired polymerase activity and restricted <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> growth at elevated temperatures. In vivo characterization of two <span class="match annotated ">H1N1</span> vaccine candidates generated using the ty/04 att backbone demonstrated that this vaccine is highly attenuated in <span class="unannotated ">mice</span>, as indicated by the absence of signs of disease, limited replication, and minimum histopathological alterations in the respiratory tract. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> single immunization with the ty/04 att-based vaccines conferred complete protection against a lethal <span class="unannotated ">H1N1pdm</span><span class="unannotated ">H1N1pdm virus</span> infection in <span class="unannotated ">mice</span>. More importantly, vaccination of <span class="unannotated ">pigs</span> with a ty/04 att-H1N1 vaccine candidate resulted in sterilizing immunity upon an aggressive intratracheal challenge with the 2009 <span class="match unannotated ">H1N1</span> pandemic <span class="unannotated ">virus</span>. Our studies highlight the safety of the ty/04 att vaccine platform and its potential as a master donor strain for the generation of live attenuated vaccines for <span class="annotated ">humans</span> and livestock. 
<h3>20951165</h3>The validation of a real-time RT-PCR assay which detects <span class="unannotated ">influenza A</span><span class="unannotated ">A</span> and types simultaneously for <span class="annotated ">influenza A H1N1</span> (2009) and oseltamivir-resistant (H275Y) <span class="unannotated ">influenza A H1N1</span><span class="unannotated ">A</span> <span class="match unannotated ">H1N1</span> (2009). <br><br>Influenza <span class="unannotated ">A</span> <span class="match unannotated ">H1N1</span> (2009) was declared by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as the first <span class="unannotated ">influenza</span> pandemic of the 21st century. Rapid detection of <span class="unannotated ">influenza A</span><span class="unannotated ">A</span> and differentiation of <span class="unannotated ">influenza A H1N1</span><span class="unannotated ">A</span> <span class="match unannotated ">H1N1</span> (2009) and seasonal <span class="unannotated ">influenza A</span><span class="unannotated ">A</span> is beneficial. In addition the rapid detection of antiviral resistant strains of <span class="unannotated ">influenza A H1N1</span><span class="unannotated ">A</span> <span class="match unannotated ">H1N1</span> (2009) would be useful for clinicians to allow for change to an effective treatment at a much earlier stage if resistance is found. It was the aim of this study to develop a real-time RT-PCR that can detect all <span class="annotated ">influenza A viruses</span> and type simultaneously for <span class="annotated ">influenza A H1N1</span> (2009) and oseltamivir resistant (H275Y) <span class="annotated ">influenza A H1N1</span> (2009). This multiplex assay will allow laboratories to screen respiratory samples for all types of <span class="annotated ">influenza A</span>, <span class="annotated ">influenza A H1N1</span> (2009) <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> and oseltamivir resistant (H275Y) <span class="annotated ">influenza A H1N1</span> (2009) <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> in a rapid and cost effective format, ensuring that typing methods for seasonal and avian viruses are used on a smaller subset of samples. Since most virology laboratories already offer a molecular service for <span class="unannotated ">influenza A</span><span class="unannotated ">A</span> this assay could easily be implemented into most areas at little cost therefore increasing local access to resistance testing. 
<h3>20962098</h3>PB2 residue 158 is a pathogenic determinant of pandemic <span class="match annotated ">H1N1</span> and <span class="annotated ">H5 influenza a viruses</span> in <span class="annotated ">mice</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Influenza A viruses</span> are <span class="annotated ">human</span> and animal pathogens that cause morbidity and mortality, which range from mild to severe. The 2009 <span class="match annotated ">H1N1</span> pandemic was caused by the emergence of a reassortant <span class="match annotated ">H1N1</span> subtype (<span class="annotated ">H1N1pdm</span>) <span class="annotated ">influenza A virus</span> containing gene segments that originally circulated in <span class="annotated ">human</span>, avian, and <span class="annotated ">swine</span> <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> reservoirs. The molecular determinants of replication and pathogenesis of <span class="annotated ">H1N1pdm viruses</span> in <span class="annotated ">humans</span> and other mammals are poorly understood. Therefore, we set out to elucidate <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> determinants critical to the pathogenesis of this novel reassortant using a <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> model. We found that a glutamate-to-glycine substitution at residue 158 of the PB2 gene (PB2-E158G) increased the morbidity and mortality of the parental <span class="annotated ">H1N1pdm virus</span>. Results from mini-genome replication assays in <span class="annotated ">human</span> cells and <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> titration in <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> tissues demonstrated that PB2-E158G is a pathogenic determinant, because it significantly increases <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> replication rates. The <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> load in PB2-E158G-infected <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> lungs was 1,300-fold higher than that of the wild-type <span class="unannotated ">virus</span>. Our data also show that PB2-E158G had a much stronger influence on the RNA replication and pathogenesis of <span class="annotated ">H1N1pdm viruses</span> than PB2-E627K, which is a known pathogenic determinant. Remarkably, PB2-E158G substitutions also altered the pathotypes of two avian <span class="annotated ">H5 viruses</span> in <span class="annotated ">mice</span>, indicating that this residue impacts genetically divergent <span class="annotated ">influenza A viruses</span> and suggesting that this region of PB2 could be a new antiviral target. Collectively, the data presented in this study demonstrate that PB2-E158G is a novel pathogenic determinant of <span class="annotated ">influenza A viruses</span> in the <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> model. We speculate that PB2-E158G may be important in the adaptation of avian PB2 genes to other mammals, and BLAST sequence analysis identified a naturally occurring <span class="annotated ">human</span> <span class="annotated ">H1N1pdm</span> isolate that has this substitution. Therefore, future surveillance efforts should include scrutiny of this region of PB2 because of its potential impact on pathogenesis.
