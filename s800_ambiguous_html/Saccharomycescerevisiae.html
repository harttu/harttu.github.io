<h2>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20044015</h3>Characterizing the role of the microtubule binding protein Bim1 in <span class="annotated ">Cryptococcus neoformans</span>. <br><br>During sexual development the <span class="annotated ">human</span> <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> pathogen <span class="annotated ">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> undergoes a developmental transition from yeast-form growth to filamentous growth. This transition requires cellular restructuring to form a filamentous dikaryon. Dikaryotic growth also requires tightly controlled nuclear migration to ensure faithful replication and dissemination of genetic material to spore progeny. Although the gross morphological changes that take place during dikaryotic growth are largely known, the molecular underpinnings that control this process are uncharacterized. Here we identify and characterize a <span class="annotated ">C. neoformans</span> homolog of the <span class="match annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> BIM1 gene, and establish the importance of BIM1 for proper filamentous growth of <span class="annotated ">C. neoformans</span>. Deletion of BIM1 leads to truncated sexual development filaments, a severe defect in diploid formation, and a block in monokaryotic fruiting. Our findings lead to a model consistent with a critical role for BIM1 in both filament integrity and nuclear congression that is mediated through the microtubule cytoskeleton. 
<h3>20637818</h3>The <span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span> Rgd1 is a RhoGAP protein involved in the control of filamentous growth. <br><br>Rho proteins are essential regulators of polarized growth in eukaryotic cells. These proteins are down-regulated in vivo by specific Rho GTPase Activating Proteins (RhoGAP). We investigated the role of Rgd1 RhoGAP, encoded by the <span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span> RGD1 gene. We demonstrated that CaCdc42, CaRho3 and CaRho4 proteins had an intrinsic GTPase activity and that CaRgd1 stimulates in vitro GTP hydrolysis of these GTPases. Deletion of RGD1 in <span class="annotated ">C. albicans</span> results in sensitivity to low pH as already described for rgd1Delta in <span class="match annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>. The role of Rgd1 in survival at low pH is conserved in the two <span class="unannotated ">yeast</span> species as the CaRGD1 gene complements the Scrgd1Delta sensitivity. By tagging the RhoGAP with GFP, we found that CaRgd1 is localized at the tip and cortex of growing cells and during cytokinesis at the septation sites in <span class="unannotated ">yeast</span> and filamentous forms. We investigated the effect of CaRgd1 on the control of the polarized growth. Removing CaRGD1 alleles increased filamentous growth and cells lacking CaRgd1 presented longer germ tubes. Conversely, RGD1 overexpression restricted hyphae growth. Our results demonstrate that Rgd1 is critical for filamentous formation in <span class="annotated ">C. albicans</span> especially for filamentous elongation. 
<h3>20713166</h3>Characterization of the <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus nidulans</span> biotin biosynthetic gene cluster and use of the bioDA gene as a new transformation marker. <br><br>The genes involved in the biosynthesis of biotin were identified in the hyphal fungus <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus nidulans</span> through homology searches and complementation of <span class="annotated ">Escherichia coli</span> biotin-auxotrophic mutants. Whereas the 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid synthase and dethiobiotin synthetase are encoded by distinct genes in bacteria and the <span class="annotated ">yeast</span> <span class="match annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, both activities are performed in <span class="annotated ">A. nidulans</span> by a single enzyme, encoded by the bifunctional gene bioDA. Such a bifunctional bioDA gene is a genetic feature common to numerous members of the ascomycete filamentous fungi and basidiomycetes, as well as in plants and oomycota. However, unlike in other eukaryota, the three bio genes contributing to the four enzymatic steps from pimeloyl-CoA to biotin are organized in a gene cluster in pezizomycotina. The <span class="annotated ">A. nidulans</span> auxotrophic mutants biA1, biA2 and biA3 were all found to have mutations in the 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid synthase domain of the bioDA gene. Although biotin auxotrophy is an inconvenient marker in classical genetic manipulations due to cross-feeding of biotin, transformation of the biA1 mutant with the bioDA gene from either <span class="annotated ">A. nidulans</span> or <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus fumigatus</span> led to the recovery of well-defined biotin-prototrophic colonies. The usefulness of bioDA gene as a novel and robust transformation marker was demonstrated in co-transformation experiments with a green fluorescent protein reporter, and in the efficient deletion of the laccase (yA) gene via homologous recombination in a mutant lacking non-homologous end-joining activity. 
<h3>20728557</h3>General factors important for the formation of structured biofilm-like <span class="annotated ">yeast</span> colonies. <br><br>The lifestyle of wild and laboratory <span class="annotated ">yeast</span> strains significantly differs. In contrast to the smooth colonies of laboratory strains, wild <span class="match annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> strains form biofilm-like, strikingly structured colonies possessing distinctive traits enabling them to better survive in hostile environments in the wild. Here, comparing three sets of strains forming differently structured colonies (fluffy, semi-fluffy and smooth), each derived from ancestors with distinct genetic backgrounds isolated from natural settings (BR-88, BR-99 and BR-103), we specified the factors essential for the formation of structured colonies, i.e. for the lifestyle most likely to be preferred in the wild. The ability to form an abundant extracellular matrix (ECM) is one of the features typical for structured colonies. ECM influences colony architecture and many other physiological properties, such as the capability to retain water in a 2-fold surplus to wet cell biomass. ECM composition, however, differs among distinct strains, depending on their particular genetic background. We further show that the expression of certain genes (AQY1, FLO11) is also strictly related to the particular colony morphology, being highest in the most structured colonies. Flo11p adhesin, important for cell-cell and cell-surface adhesion, is essential for the formation of fluffy colonies and thus significantly contributes to the phenotype variability of wild <span class="annotated ">yeast</span> strains. On the other hand, surprisingly, neither the cell shape nor budding pattern nor the ability to form pseudohyphae directly influences the formation of three-dimensional fluffy colony architecture. 
<h3>20962094</h3><span class="annotated ">Yeast</span>-elicited cross-reactive antibodies to <span class="annotated ">HIV</span> Env glycans efficiently neutralize virions expressing exclusively high-mannose N-linked glycans. <br><br>The <span class="unannotated ">HIV</span> envelope (Env) protein uses a dense coat of glycans to mask conserved domains and evade host humoral immune responses. The broadly neutralizing antibody 2G12, which binds a specific cluster of high-mannose glycans on <span class="unannotated ">HIV</span> Env, shows that the glycan shield can also serve as a target for neutralizing antibodies. We have described a triple mutant <span class="match annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> strain that expresses high-mannose glycoproteins that bind to 2G12. When used to immunize <span class="annotated ">rabbits</span>, this <span class="annotated ">yeast</span> elicits antibodies that bind to gp120-associated glycans but fail to neutralize <span class="unannotated ">virus</span>. Here we sought to determine the reason for these discordant results. Affinity purification of sera over columns conjugated with three 2G12-reactive <span class="annotated ">yeast</span> glycoproteins showed that these proteins could adsorb 80% of the antibodies that bind to gp120 glycans. Despite binding to monomeric gp120, these mannose-specific antibodies failed to bind cell surface-expressed trimeric Env. However, when Env was expressed in the presence of the mannosidase inhibitor kifunensine to force retention of high-mannose glycans at all sites, the purified antibodies gained the abilities to bind trimeric Env and to strongly and broadly neutralize viruses produced under these conditions. Combined, these data show that the triple mutant <span class="annotated ">yeast</span> strain elicits antibodies that bind to high-mannose glycans presented on the <span class="unannotated ">HIV</span> envelope, but only when they are displayed in a manner not found on native Env trimers. This implies that the underlying structure of the protein scaffold used to present the high-mannose glycans may be critical to allow elicitation of antibodies that recognize trimeric Env and neutralize <span class="unannotated ">virus</span>. 
<h3>20962095</h3>Role of RNase MRP in <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> RNA degradation and RNA recombination.<br><br>RNA degradation, together with RNA synthesis, controls the steady-state level of <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> RNAs in infected cells. The endoribonucleolytic cleavage of <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> RNA is important not only for <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> RNA degradation but for RNA recombination as well, due to the participation of some RNA degradation products in the RNA recombination process. To identify host endoribonucleases involved in degradation of <span class="annotated ">Tomato bushy stunt virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">TBSV</span>) in a <span class="match annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> model host, we tested eight known endoribonucleases. Here we report that downregulation of SNM1, encoding a component of the RNase MRP, and a temperature-sensitive mutation in the NME1 gene, coding for the RNA component of RNase MRP, lead to reduced production of the endoribonucleolytically cleaved <span class="annotated ">TBSV</span> RNA in <span class="annotated ">yeast</span>. We also show that the highly purified <span class="annotated ">yeast</span> RNase MRP cleaves the <span class="annotated ">TBSV</span> RNA in vitro, resulting in <span class="annotated ">TBSV</span> RNA degradation products similar in size to those observed in <span class="annotated ">yeast</span> cells. Knocking down the NME1 homolog in <span class="annotated ">Nicotiana benthamiana</span> also led to decreased production of the cleaved <span class="annotated ">TBSV</span> RNA, suggesting that in plants, RNase MRP is involved in <span class="annotated ">TBSV</span> RNA degradation. Altogether, this work suggests a role for the host endoribonuclease RNase MRP in <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> RNA degradation and recombination. 
<h3>20971202</h3>Ste50 adaptor protein governs sexual differentiation of <span class="annotated ">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> via the pheromone-response MAPK signaling pathway. <br><br>The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways control diverse cellular functions in pathogenic fungi, including sexual differentiation, stress response, and maintenance of cell wall integrity. Here we characterized a <span class="annotated ">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> gene, which is homologous to the <span class="unannotated ">yeast</span> Ste50 that is known to play an important role in mating pheromone response and stress response as an adaptor protein to the Ste11 MAPK kinase kinase in <span class="match annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>. The <span class="annotated ">C. neoformans</span> Ste50 was not involved in any of the stress responses or virulence factor production (capsule and melanin) that are controlled by the HOG and Ras/cAMP signaling pathways. However, Ste50 was required for mating in both <span class="annotated ">serotype A</span> and <span class="annotated ">serotype D C. neoformans</span> strains. The ste50Delta mutant was completely defective in cell-cell fusion and mating pheromone production. Double mutation of the STE50 gene blocked increased production of pheromone and the hyper-filamentation phenotype of cells deleted of the CRG1 gene, which encodes the RGS protein that negatively regulates pheromone responsive G-protein signaling via the MAPK pathway. Regardless of the presence of the basidiomycota-specific SH3 domains of Ste50 that are known to be required for full virulence of <span class="annotated ">Ustilago maydis</span>, Ste50 was dispensable for virulence of <span class="annotated ">C. neoformans</span> in a <span class="linneaus_only ">murine</span> model of cryptococcosis. In conclusion, the Ste50 adaptor protein controls sexual differentiation of <span class="annotated ">C. neoformans</span> via the pheromone-responsive MAPK pathway but is not required for virulence. 
<h3>21047956</h3>Genetic analysis of B55alpha/Cdc55 protein phosphatase 2A subunits: association with the <span class="unannotated ">adenovirus</span> E4orf4 protein. <br><br>The <span class="annotated ">human</span> <span class="unannotated ">adenovirus</span> E4orf4 protein is toxic in both <span class="annotated ">human</span> tumor cells and <span class="match annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>. Previous studies indicated that most of this toxicity is dependent on an interaction of E4orf4 protein with the B55 class of regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and in <span class="annotated ">yeast</span> with the B55 homolog Cdc55. We have found previously that E4orf4 inhibits PP2A activity against at least some substrates. In an attempt to understand the mechanism of this inhibition, we used a genetic approach to identify residues in the seven-bladed Beta-propeller proteins B55alpha and Cdc55 required for E4orf4 binding. In both cases, amino-terminal polypeptides composed only of blade 1 and at least part of blade 2 were found to bind E4orf4 and overexpression blocked E4orf4 toxicity in <span class="annotated ">yeast</span>. Furthermore, certain amino acid substitutions in blades 1 and 2 within full-length B55alpha and Cdc55 resulted in loss of E4orf4 binding. Recent mutational analysis has suggested that segments of blades 1 and 2 present on the top face of B55alpha form part of the &quot;substrate-binding groove.&quot; Additionally, these segments are in close proximity to the catalytic C subunit of the PP2A holoenzyme. Thus, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that E4orf4 binding could affect the access of substrates, resulting in the failure to dephosphorylate some PP2A substrates. 
<h3>21111055</h3>Mating differentiation in <span class="annotated ">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> is negatively regulated by the Crk1 protein kinase. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> is a heterothallic basidiomycete that grows vegetatively as <span class="annotated ">yeast</span> and filamentous hyphae are produced in the sexual state. Previous studies have shown that <span class="annotated ">C. neoformans</span> Cwc1 and Cwc2 are two central photoregulators which form a complex to inhibit the production of sexual filaments upon light treatment. To reveal the detailed regulatory mechanisms, a genome wide mutagenesis screen was conducted and components in the Cwc1/Cwc2 complex mediated pathway have been identified. In this study, one suppressor mutant, DJ22, is characterized and T-DNA is found to disrupt the <span class="annotated ">C. neoformans</span> CRK1 gene, a homologue of <span class="match annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> IME2 and <span class="annotated ">Ustilago maydis</span> crk1. Ime2 is a meiosis-specific gene with the conserved Ser/Thr kinase domain and TXY dual phosphorylation site. Consistent with the findings of other suppressors in our screen, <span class="annotated ">C. neoformans</span> Crk1 plays a negative role in the mating process. Dikaryotic filaments, basidia, and basidiospores are produced earlier in the crk1 mutant crosses and mating efficiency is also increased. Artificial elevation of the CRK1 mRNA level inhibits mating. Interestingly, monokaryotic fruiting is defective both in the MATalpha crk1 mutant and CRK1 overexpression strains. Our studies demonstrate that <span class="unannotated ">C. neoformans</span> CRK1 gene functions as a negative regulator in the mating differentiation. 
<h3>21145409</h3>Overexpression of the trichodiene synthase gene tri5 increases trichodermin production and antimicrobial activity in <span class="annotated ">Trichoderma brevicompactum</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Trichoderma brevicompactum</span> produces trichodermin, a simple trichothecene-type toxin that shares the first steps of the sesquiterpene biosynthetic pathway with other phytotoxic trichothecenes from <span class="annotated ">Fusarium spp</span>. Trichodiene synthase catalyses the conversion of farnesyl pyrophosphate to trichodiene and it is encoded by the tri5 gene that was cloned and analysed functionally by homologous overexpression in <span class="annotated ">T. brevicompactum</span>. tri5 expression was up-regulated in media with glucose, H(2)O(2) or glycerol. tri5 repression was observed in cultures supplemented with the antioxidants ferulic acid and tyrosol. Acetone extracts of tri5-overexpressing transformants displayed higher antifungal activity than those from the wild-type. Chromatographic and spectroscopic analyses revealed that tri5 overexpression led to an increased production of trichodermin and tyrosol. Agar diffusion assays with these two purified metabolites from the tri5-overexpressing transformant <span class="annotated ">T. brevicompactum</span> Tb41tri5 showed that only trichodermin had antifungal activity against <span class="match annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, <span class="annotated ">Kluyveromyces marxianus</span>, <span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span>, <span class="annotated ">Candida glabrata</span>, <span class="annotated ">Candida tropicalis</span> and <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus fumigatus</span>, in most cases such activity being higher than that observed for amphotericin B and hygromycin. Our results point to the significant role of tri5 in the production of trichodermin and in the antifungal activity of <span class="annotated ">T. brevicompactum</span>. 
<h3>21281727</h3>Identification and characterization of putative osmosensors, HwSho1A and HwSho1B, from the extremely halotolerant <span class="unannotated ">black</span> <span class="unannotated ">yeast</span> <span class="annotated ">Hortaea werneckii</span>. <br><br>In <span class="match annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, the Sho1 protein is one of two potential osmosensors that can activate the kinase cascade of the HOG pathway in response to increased extracellular osmolarity. Two novel SHO1-like genes, HwSHO1A and HwSHO1B, have been cloned from the saltern-inhabiting, extremely halotolerant <span class="unannotated ">black</span> <span class="unannotated ">yeast</span> <span class="annotated ">Hortaea werneckii</span>. The HwSho1 protein isoforms are 93.8% identical in their amino-acid sequences, and have a conserved SH3 domain. When the HwSHO1 genes were transferred into <span class="annotated ">S. cerevisae</span> cells lacking the SHO1 gene, both of the HwSho1 isoforms fully complemented the function of the native <span class="annotated ">S. cerevisiae</span> Sho1 protein. Through microscopic and biochemical validation, we demonstrate that in <span class="annotated ">S. cerevisiae</span>, both of the HwSho1 proteins have characteristic subcellular localizations similar to the <span class="annotated ">S. cerevisiae</span> Sho1 protein, and they can both activate the HOG pathway under conditions of osmotic stress. To a lower extent, crosstalk to the mating pathway expressing HwSho1 proteins is conserved in the PBS2 deleted <span class="annotated ">S. cerevisiae</span> strain. These data show that the HwSho1 proteins from <span class="annotated ">H. werneckii</span> are true functional homologs of the Sho1 protein of <span class="annotated ">S. cerevisiae</span>. 
<h3>21784165</h3>Functions of the mitotic B-type cyclins CLB1, CLB2, and CLB3 at mitotic exit antagonized by the CDC14 phosphatase. <br><br>In the budding <span class="annotated ">yeast</span> <span class="match annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, cell cycle progression and cytokinesis at mitotic exit are proposed to be linked by CDC14 phosphatase antagonizing the function of mitotic B-type cyclin (CLBs). We have isolated a temperature-sensitive mutant, cdc14(A280V), with a mutation in the conserved phosphatase domain. Prolonged arrest in the cdc14(A280V) mutant partially uncoupled cell cycle progression from the completion of cytokinesis as measured by bud re-emergence, in the form of elongated apical projections, and DNA re-replication. In contrast to previous mitotic exit mutants, cdc14(A280V) mutants displayed a strong bias for the first apical projection to form in the mother cell body. Using cdc14(A280V) mutant phenotypes, the functions of the B-type cyclins at mitotic exit were investigated. The preference in mother-daughter apical projection formation was observed to be independent of any individual CLB function. However, cdc14(A280V)clb1Delta cells displayed a pronounced increase in apical projections, while cdc14(A280V)clb3Delta cells were observed to form round cellular chains. While cdc14(A280V) cells arrested at mitotic exit, both cdc14(A280V)clb1Delta and cdc14(A280V)clb3Delta cells completed cytokinesis, but failed cell separation. cdc14(A280V)clb2Delta cells displayed a defect in actin ring assembly. These observations differentiate the functions of CLB1, CLB2, and CLB3 at mitotic exit, and are consistent with the hypothesis that CLB activities are antagonized by the CDC14 phosphatase in order to couple cell cycle progression with cytokinesis at mitotic exit. 
<h3>21801845</h3>The transcriptional response of <span class="match annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> to proapoptotic concentrations of <span class="annotated ">Pichia membranifaciens</span> killer toxin. <br><br>PMKT (<span class="annotated ">Pichia membranifaciens</span> killer toxin) reportedly has antimicrobial activity against <span class="annotated ">yeasts</span> and filamentous fungi. In previous research we posited that high PMKT concentrations pose a serious challenge for cell survival by disrupting plasma membrane electrochemical gradients, inducing a transcriptional response similar to that of certain stimuli such as hyperosmotic shock. This response was related to the HOG-pathway with Hog1p phosphorylation and a transitional increase in intracellular glycerol accumulation. Such a response was consistent with the notion that the effect induced by high PMKT concentrations lies in an alteration to the ionic homeostasis of the sensitive cell. By contrast, the evidence presented here shows that low PMKT doses lead to a cell death process in <span class="match annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> accompanied by cytological and biochemical indicators of apoptotic programmed cell death, namely, the production of reactive oxygen species, DNA strand breaks, metacaspase activation and cytochrome c release. Furthermore, dying cells progressed from an apoptotic state to a secondary necrotic state, and the rate at which this change occurred was proportional to the intensity of the stimulus. We have explored the global gene expression response of <span class="annotated ">S. cerevisiae</span> during that stimulus. The results obtained from DNA microarrays indicate that genes related with an oxidative stress response were induced in response to proapoptotic concentrations of PMKT, showing that the coordinated transcriptional response is not coincident with that obtained when ionophoric concentrations of PMKT are used. By contrast, cwp2Delta mutants showed no signs of apoptosis, indicating that the initial steps of the killer mechanism coincide when proapoptotic (low) or ionophoric (high) PMKT concentrations are used. Additionally, low dosages of PMKT promoted Hog1p phosphorylation and glycerol accumulation. 
<h3>21820070</h3>Application of the systematic "DAmP" approach to create a partially defective <span class="annotated ">C. albicans</span> mutant. <br><br>An understanding of gene function often relies upon creating multiple kinds of alleles. Functional analysis in <span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span>, a major <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> pathogen, has generally included characterization of mutant strains with insertion or deletion alleles and over-expression alleles. Here we use in <span class="annotated ">C. albicans</span> another type of allele that has been employed effectively in the model <span class="annotated ">yeast</span> <span class="match annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, a "Decreased Abundance by mRNA Perturbation" (DAmP) allele (Yan et al., 2008). DAmP alleles are created systematically through replacement of 30 noncoding regions with nonfunctional heterologous sequences, and thus are broadly applicable. We used a DAmP allele to probe the function of Sun41, a surface protein with roles in cell wall integrity, cell-cell adherence, hyphal formation, and biofilm formation that has been suggested as a possible therapeutic target (Firon et al., 2007; Hiller et al., 2007; Norice et al., 2007). <span class="unannotated ">A</span> SUN41-DAmP allele results in approximately 10-fold reduced levels of SUN41 RNA, and yields intermediate phenotypes in most assays. We report that a sun41Delta/Delta mutant is defective in biofilm formation in vivo, and that the SUN41-DAmP allele complements that defect. This finding argues that Sun41 may not be an ideal therapeutic target for biofilm inhibition, since a 90% decrease in activity has little effect on biofilm formation in vivo. We anticipate that DAmP alleles of <span class="unannotated ">C. albicans</span> genes will be informative for analysis of other prospective drug targets, including essential genes. 
<h3>20817000</h3>Amino acid divergence between the CHS domain contributes to the different intracellular behaviour of Family II <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> chitin synthases in <span class="match annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>. <br><br>Family II chitin synthases (CS), including classes IV and V enzymes, share conserved catalytic domains flanked by transmembrane regions. Here we addressed the characterization of Family II <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> CSs by heterologous expression in <span class="match annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>. Full-length CSs from classes V or IV were not functional when expressed in <span class="annotated ">S. cerevisiae</span> and accumulated in different intracellular compartments. However, the exchange between different class IV, but not of class V, CHS domains resulted in functional proteins both in vivo and in vitro. The different domains afford the chimeric proteins distinct intracellular behaviours, ranging from endoplasmic reticulum retention to reduced endocytic turnover at the plasma membrane. These results allow a role in chitin synthesis to be assigned to all class IV enzymes, but they also highlight the involvement of the intracellular globular domain of these CSs, not only in enzymatic activity but also in the regulation of their intracellular turnover. 
<h3>21511048</h3>The contribution of the S-phase checkpoint genes MEC1 and SGS1 to genome stability maintenance in <span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span>. <br><br>Genome rearrangements, a common feature of <span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span> isolates, are often associated with the acquisition of antifungal drug resistance. In <span class="match annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, perturbations in the S-phase checkpoints result in the same sort of Gross Chromosomal Rearrangements (GCRs) observed in <span class="annotated ">C. albicans</span>. Several proteins are involved in the <span class="annotated ">S. cerevisiae</span> cell cycle checkpoints, including Mec1p, a protein kinase of the PIKK (phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase-like kinase) family and the central player in the DNA damage checkpoint. Sgs1p, the ortholog of BLM, the Bloom's syndrome gene, is a RecQ-related DNA helicase; cells from BLM <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span> are characterized by an increase in genome instability. <span class="annotated ">Yeast</span> strains bearing deletions in MEC1 or SGS1 are viable (in contrast to the inviability seen with loss of MEC1 in <span class="annotated ">S. cerevisiae</span>) but the different deletion mutants have significantly different phenotypes. The mec1Delta/Delta colonies have a wild-type colony morphology, while the sgs1Delta/Delta mutants are slow-growing, producing wrinkled colonies with pseudohyphal-like cells. The mec1Delta/Delta mutants are only sensitive to ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS), methylmethane sulfonate (MMS), and hydroxyurea (HU) but the sgs1Delta/Delta mutants exhibit a high sensitivity to all DNA-damaging agents tested. In an assay for chromosome 1 integrity, the mec1Delta/Delta mutants exhibit an increase in genome instability; no change was observed in the sgs1Delta/Delta mutants. Finally, loss of MEC1 does not affect sensitivity to the antifungal drug fluconazole, while loss of SGS1 leads to an increased susceptibility to fluconazole. Neither deletion elevated the level of antifungal drug resistance acquisition. 
<h3>21406243</h3>Potassium and sodium uptake systems in fungi. The transporter diversity of <span class="annotated ">Magnaporthe oryzae</span>. <br><br>In this study, we report an inventory of the K(+) uptake systems in 62 <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> species for which the complete genome sequences are available. This inventory reveals that three types of K(+) uptake systems, TRK and HAK transporters and ACU ATPases, are widely present in several combinations across <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> species. PAT ATPases are less frequently present and are exceptional in Ascomycota. The genome of <span class="annotated ">Magnaporthe oryzae</span> contains four TRK, one HAK, and two ACU genes. The study of the expression of these genes at high K(+), K(+) starvation, and in infected <span class="annotated ">rice</span> leaves revealed that the expression of four genes, ACU1, ACU2, HAK1, and TRK1 is much lower than that of TRK2, TRK3, and TRK4, except under K(+) starvation. The two ACU ATPases were cloned and functionally identified as high-affinity K(+) or Na(+) uptake systems. These two ATPases endow <span class="match annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> with the capacity to grow for several generations in low Na(+) concentrations when K(+) was absent, which produces a dramatic increase of cellular Na(+)/K(+) ratio. 
<h3>21839848</h3>The small GTPase BcCdc42 affects nuclear division, germination and virulence of the gray mold fungus <span class="annotated ">Botrytis cinerea</span>. <br><br>The small GTPase Cdc42 plays a central role in various processes in eukaryotic cells including growth, differentiation and cytoskeleton organization. Whereas it is essential in the <span class="annotated ">yeast</span> <span class="match annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, its role in filamentous fungi differs, due to the complementing, partly overlapping function of Rac. We analyzed the role of the Cdc42 homologue in the necrotrophic, broad host range pathogen <span class="annotated ">Botrytis cinerea</span>. Deletion mutants of bccdc42 showed various growth abnormalities; the mutants had reduced growth rate and hyphal branching, they produced fewer conidia, which were enlarged and misshapen and had germination defects. Additionally, the mutants were impaired in sclerotia development. Cytological studies indicate that at least part of this phenotype could be attributed to disturbed control of nuclear division: conidia and hyphae of the mutant showed twofold higher nucleus/cytoplasm ratio compared to wild type cells. Apart from these effects on vegetative growth and differentiation, Deltabccdc42 strains were attenuated in penetration and colonization of host tissue, confirming that BcCdc42 - though being not essential like in <span class="annotated ">yeast</span> - is involved in important developmental processes in <span class="annotated ">B. cinerea</span>.
