* A greater understanding of the reproductive mechanisms that exist in Tuber spp . allows for optimization of <b>truffle</b> plantation management strategies . 
</br>
The analysis confirmed the array data for 16 out of 22 of the considered genes , confirming that a cold temperature period influences the <b>truffle</b> global gene expression . 
</br>
Since <b>truffle</b> ascomata develop during the winter period , we hypothesize that these differentially expressed genes may help the <b>truffle</b> to adapt to low temperatures and / or perceive environmental signals that regulate the fructification . 
</br>
Microscopic analysis of quick - frozen <b>truffle</b> hyphae detected the characteristic subcellular components of the hyphal tip in septate filamentous fungi , while transcript profiles revealed a moderately variable pattern during the biological cycle .
