<h2>truffle</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20961294</h3>Isolation and characterization of MAT genes in the symbiotic ascomycete <span class="yellow">Tuber melanosporum</span>. <br><br>* The genome of <span class="yellow">Tuber melanosporum</span> has recently been sequenced. Here, we used this information to identify genes involved in the reproductive processes of this edible fungus. The sequenced strain (Mel28) possesses only one of the two master genes required for mating, that is, the gene that codes for the high mobility group (HMG) transcription factor (MAT1-2-1), whereas it lacks the gene that codes for the protein containing the alpha-box- domain (MAT1-1-1), suggesting that this fungus is heterothallic. * <span class="yellow">A</span> PCR-based approach was initially employed to screen truffles for the presence of the MAT1-2-1 gene and amplify the conserved regions flanking the mating type (MAT) locus. The MAT1-1-1 gene was finally identified using primers designed from the conserved regions of strains that lack the MAT1-2-1 gene. * Mating type-specific primer pairs were developed to screen asci and gleba from truffles of different origins and to genotype single ascospores within the asci. These analyses provided definitive evidence that <span class="yellow">T. melanosporum</span> is a heterothallic species with a MAT locus that is organized similarly to those of ancient <span class="yellow">fungal</span> lineages. * <span class="yellow">A</span> greater understanding of the reproductive mechanisms that exist in Tuber spp. allows for optimization of <span class="red">truffle</span> plantation management strategies. 
<h3>20964691</h3><span class="yellow">Tuber melanosporum</span>: mating type distribution in a natural plantation and dynamics of strains of different mating types on the roots of nursery-inoculated host plants. <br><br>* In light of the recent finding that <span class="yellow">Tuber melanosporum</span>, the ectomycorrhizal ascomycete that produces the most highly prized <span class="yellow">black truffles</span>, is a heterothallic species, we monitored the spatial distribution of strains with opposite mating types (MAT) in a natural <span class="blue">truffle</span> ground and followed strain dynamics in artificially inoculated host plants grown under controlled conditions. * In a natural <span class="blue">truffle</span> ground, ectomycorrhizas (ECMs), soil samples and fruit bodies were sampled and genotyped to determine mating types. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were also used to fingerprint ECMs and fruit bodies. The ECMs from nursery-inoculated host plants were analysed for mating type at 6 months and 19 months post-inoculation. * In open-field conditions, all ECMs from the same sampling site showed an identical mating type and an identical haploid genotype, based on SSR analysis. Interestingly, the gleba of fruit bodies always demonstrated the same genotype as the surrounding ECMs. Although root tips from nursery-grown plants initially developed ECMs of both mating types, a dominance of ECMs of the same MAT were found after several months. * The present study deepens our understanding of the vegetative and sexual propagation modes of <span class="yellow">T. melanosporum</span>. These results are highly relevant for <span class="blue">truffle</span> cultivation. 
<h3>20884368</h3>The <span class="yellow">Perigord black truffle</span> responds to cold temperature with an extensive reprogramming of its transcriptional activity. <br><br>The <span class="yellow">Tuber melanosporum</span> genome has been analysed with the aim of identifying and characterizing the genes involved in the environmental stress response. <span class="yellow">A</span> whole genome array (7496 genes/probe) was used to verify the <span class="yellow">fungal</span> transcriptional profiling upon a cold temperature period (7 days at 4 ^0C). <span class="yellow">A</span> total of 423 genes resulted to be differentially expressed in a significant manner (>2.5-fold; p-value&lt;0.05) in the mycelia exposed to cold, compared to the control ones: 187 of these genes were up-regulated, while 236 were down-regulated. Sixty-six and fifty-one percent, respectively, of the up- or down-regulated transcripts had no KOG classification and were clustered as unclassified proteins, which was the most abundant category in the both up- and down-regulated genes. <span class="yellow">A</span> gene subset, containing a range of biological functions, was chosen to validate the microarray experiment through quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). The analysis confirmed the array data for 16 out of 22 of the considered genes, confirming that a cold temperature period influences the <span class="red">truffle</span> global gene expression. The expressed genes, which mostly resulted to be genes for heat shock proteins (HSPs) and genes involved in cell wall and lipid metabolism, could be involved in mechanisms, which are responsible for <span class="yellow">fungal</span> adaptation. Since <span class="red">truffle</span> ascomata develop during the winter period, we hypothesize that these differentially expressed genes may help the <span class="red">truffle</span> to adapt to low temperatures and/or perceive environmental signals that regulate the fructification. 
<h3>21176788</h3>Hyphal and cytoskeleton polarization in <span class="yellow">Tuber melanosporum</span>: a genomic and cellular analysis. <br><br>Filamentous polarized growth involves a series of events including polarization of the cytoskeleton to selected growth sites, and the transport of secretory vesicles containing the components required for growth. The availability of <span class="yellow">fungal</span> genome sequences has recently led to the identification of a large number of proteins involved in these processes. We have explored the <span class="yellow">Tuber melanosporum</span> genome sequence by searching for homologs of genes known to play crucial roles in the morphogenesis and cell polarity of <span class="yellow">yeasts</span> and filamentous fungi. One hundred and forty-nine genes have been identified and functionally grouped according to the deduced amino acid sequences (44 genes involved in cell polarity/morphogenesis, 39 belonging to the actin cytoskeleton and 66 involved in membrane dynamics, septation and exocytosis). <span class="yellow">A</span> detailed gene annotation has shown that most components of the cell polarity machinery, morphogenesis and cytoskeleton found in <span class="yellow">yeasts</span> and filamentous fungi are conserved, although the degree of similarity varies from strong to weak. Microscopic analysis of quick-frozen <span class="red">truffle</span> hyphae detected the characteristic subcellular components of the hyphal tip in septate filamentous fungi, while transcript profiles revealed a moderately variable pattern during the biological cycle.
