<h2>Serinibacter salmoneus</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20173007</h3><span class="yellow">Miniimonas arenae</span> gen. nov., sp. nov., an actinobacterium isolated from sea sand. <br><br>A Gram-positive, non-motile, coccoid- to rod-shaped, non-spore-forming bacterium, designated strain <span class="yellow">YM18-15</span>(T), was isolated from sea sand and studied using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. Strain <span class="yellow">YM18-15</span>(T) grew under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The cell-wall peptidoglycan type was A4Beta and ornithine was the diagnostic diamino acid. The polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol and an unknown phospholipid, MK-8(H(4)) was the major menaquinone and the predominant fatty acids were anteiso-C(15 : 0) and C(16 : 0). The DNA G+C content was 74.2 mol%. High 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities (96.3-97.3 %) were found with the sequences of the type strains of the three genera of the family Beutenbergiaceae. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain <span class="yellow">YM18-15</span>(T) formed a clade with <span class="blue">Serinibacter salmoneus</span>, <span class="yellow">Salana multivorans</span> and <span class="yellow">Beutenbergia cavernae</span>. Strain <span class="yellow">YM18-15</span>(T) differed from these three type strains in chemotaxonomic characteristics and in 16S rRNA gene signature nucleotides. Based on genetic and chemotaxonomic evidence, it is suggested that strain <span class="yellow">YM18-15</span>(T) represents a novel species of a new genus within the family Beutenbergiaceae, for which the name <span class="yellow">Miniimonas arenae</span> gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of the type species is <span class="yellow">YM18-15</span>(T) (=NBRC 106267(T)=KCTC 19750(T)=MBIC 08348(T)).
