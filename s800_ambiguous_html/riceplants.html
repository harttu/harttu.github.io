* The cadmium (Cd) over-accumulating <span class="yellow">rice</span> (<span class="yellow">Oryza sativa</span>) <span class="yellow">cv Cho-Ko-Koku</span> was previously shown to have an enhanced rate of root-to-shoot Cd translocation. This trait is controlled by a single recessive allele located at qCdT7. * In this study, using positional cloning and transgenic strategies, heavy metal ATPase 3 (OsHMA3) was identified as the gene that controls root-to-shoot Cd translocation rates. The subcellular localization and Cd-transporting activity of the gene products were also investigated. * The allele of OsHMA3 that confers high root-to-shoot Cd translocation rates (OsHMA3mc) encodes a defective P(1B) -ATPase transporter. OsHMA3 fused to green fluorescent protein was localized to vacuolar membranes in plants and <span class="yellow">yeast</span>. An OsHMA3 transgene complemented Cd sensitivity in a <span class="yellow">yeast</span> mutant that lacks the ability to transport Cd into vacuoles. By contrast, OsHMA3mc did not complement the Cd sensitivity of this <span class="yellow">yeast</span> mutant, indicating that the OsHMA3mc transport function was lost. * We propose that the root cell cytoplasm of Cd-overaccumulating <span class="blue">rice plants</span> has more Cd available for loading into the xylem as a result of the lack of OsHMA3-mediated transportation of Cd to the vacuoles. This defect results in Cd translocation to the shoots in higher concentrations. These data demonstrate the importance of vacuolar sequestration for Cd accumulation in <span class="yellow">rice</span>. 
<h3>20840510</h3>Spatial distribution of arsenic and temporal variation of its concentration in <span class="yellow">rice</span>. 

* In order to gain insights into the transport and distribution of arsenic (As) in intact <span class="yellow">rice</span> (<span class="yellow">Oryza sativa</span>) plants and its unloading into the <span class="yellow">rice</span> grain, we investigated the spatial distribution of As and the temporal variation of As concentration in whole <span class="blue">rice plants</span> at different growth stages. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such a study has been performed. * Inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ICP-MS were used to analyze total As concentration and speciation. Moreover, synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence (SXRF) was used to investigate in situ As distribution in the leaf, internode, node and grain. * Total As concentrations of vegetative tissues increased during the 2 wk after flowering. The concentration of dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) in the caryopsis decreased progressively with its development, whereas inorganic As concentration remained stable. The ratios of As content between neighboring leaves or between neighboring internodes were c. 0.6. SXRF revealed As accumulation in the center of the caryopsis during its early development and then in the ovular vascular trace. * These results indicate that there are different controls on the unloading of inorganic As and DMA; the latter accumulated mainly in the caryopsis before flowering, whereas inorganic As was mainly transported into the caryopsis during grain filling. Moreover, nodes appeared to serve as a check-point in As distribution in <span class="yellow">rice</span> shoots.
