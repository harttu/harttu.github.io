<h2>Paulinella chromatophora</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21071191</h3>Cercozoa comprises both EF-1alpha-containing and EFL-containing members.<br><br>Elongation factor 1alpha (EF-1alpha) and elongation factor-like protein (EFL) are considered to be functionally equivalent proteins involved in peptide synthesis. Eukaryotes can be fundamentally divided into 'EF-1alpha-containing' and 'EFL-containing' types. Recently, EF-1alpha and EFL genes have been surveyed across the diversity of eukaryotes to explore the origin and evolution of EFL genes. Although the phylum Cercozoa is a diverse group, gene data for either EFL or EF-1alpha are absent from all cercozoans except chlorarachniophytes which were previously defined as EFL-containing members. Our survey revealed that two members of the cercozoan subphylum Filosa (Thaumatomastix sp. and strain YPF610) are EFL-containing members. Importantly, we identified EF-1alpha genes from two members of Filosa (<span class="annotated ">Paracercomonas marina</span> and <span class="match annotated ">Paulinella chromatophora</span>) and a member of the other subphylum Endomyxa (<span class="annotated ">Filoreta japonica</span>). All cercozoan EFL homologues could not be recovered as a monophyletic group in maximum-likelihood and Bayesian analyses, suggesting that lateral gene transfer was involved in the EFL evolution in this protist assemblage. In contrast, EF-1alpha analysis successfully recovered a monophyly of three homologues sampled from the two cercozoan subphyla. Based on the results, we postulate that cercozoan EF-1alpha genes have been vertically inherited, and the current EFL-containing species may have secondarily lost their EF-1alpha genes.
