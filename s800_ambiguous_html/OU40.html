<h2>OU-40</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20154329</h3><span class="annotated ">Streptomyces hyderabadensis sp. nov.</span>, an actinomycete isolated from soil.<br><br>A novel actinomycete, designated strain <span class="match annotated ">OU-40</span>(T), was isolated from farm soil collected from the Hyderabad region of Andhra Pradesh, southern India. The strain was found to have morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics typical of species of the genus Streptomyces. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain <span class="match annotated ">OU-40</span>(T) belonged to the genus Streptomyces, and was related most closely to <span class="annotated ">Streptomyces pactum</span> NBRC 13433(T) (99.0 % sequence similarity), <span class="annotated ">Streptomyces olivaceus</span> NBRC 12805(T) (99.0 %) and <span class="annotated ">Streptomyces parvulus</span> NBRC 13193(T) (98.8 %). Strain <span class="match annotated ">OU-40</span>(T) could be distinguished from the type strains of its closest phylogenetic relatives based on levels of DNA-DNA relatedness and comparison of morphological and phenotypic data. It is therefore concluded that strain <span class="match annotated ">OU-40</span>(T) represents a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name <span class="annotated ">Streptomyces hyderabadensis sp. nov.</span> is proposed. The type strain is <span class="match annotated ">OU-40</span>(T) (=CCTCC AA 209024(T) =PCM 2692(T)).
