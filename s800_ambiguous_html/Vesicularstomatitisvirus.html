<h2>vesicular stomatitis virus</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20980513</h3>R5 <span class="yellow">HIV</span> env and <span class="blue">vesicular stomatitis virus</span> G protein cooperate to mediate fusion to naive CD4+ T Cells. <br><br>Naive CD4(4) T cells are resistant to both <span class="yellow">HIV</span> R5 env and <span class="blue">vesicular stomatitis virus</span> G protein (<span class="yellow">VSV</span>-G)-mediated fusion. However, <span class="yellow">viral</span> particles carrying both <span class="yellow">HIV</span> R5 env and <span class="yellow">VSV</span>-G infect naive cells by an unexplained mechanism. We show that <span class="yellow">VSV</span>-G-pseudotyped <span class="yellow">virus</span> cannot fuse to unstimulated cells because the <span class="yellow">viral</span> particles cannot be endocytosed. However, virions carrying both <span class="yellow">HIV</span> R5 env and <span class="yellow">VSV</span>-G can fuse because CD4 binding allows <span class="yellow">viral</span> uptake. Our findings reveal a unique mechanism by which R5 <span class="yellow">HIV</span> env and <span class="yellow">VSV</span>-G cooperate to allow entry to naive CD4(+) T cells, providing a tool to target naive CD4(+) T cells with R5 <span class="yellow">HIV</span> to study <span class="yellow">HIV</span> coreceptor signaling and latency.
