<h2>murine</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20933014</h3>Monoclonal antibody-based triple antibody sandwich-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunocapture reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for <span class="annotated ">Odontoglossum ringspot virus</span> detection. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Odontoglossum ringspot virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">ORSV</span>) infects numerous commercially important orchids and causes significant losses worldwide. The coat protein (CP) gene of <span class="annotated ">ORSV</span> was cloned and expressed in <span class="annotated ">Escherichia coli</span> by using the pET-32a expression vector, and the expression of recombinant protein was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-<span class="annotated ">ORSV</span> antibodies. The recombinant protein was purified using Ni-NTA agarose, and the purified protein was used as an immunogen to produce monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and polyclonal antibodies (PAbs). Five <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">murine</span> MAbs against <span class="annotated ">ORSV</span> CP were obtained. Among them, two MAbs (6B4 and 1D1) also reacted with TMV CP. The triple antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (TAS-ELISA) and immunocapture reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (IC-RT-PCR) methods using the MAb (8A5) were then developed for sensitive, specific, and rapid detection of <span class="annotated ">ORSV</span>. TAS-ELISA and IC-RT-PCR could detect <span class="annotated ">ORSV</span> in the infected leaf saps with dilutions of 1:10,240 and 1:81,920 (w/v, g mL(-1)), respectively. TAS-ELISA and IC-RT-PCR detections indicated that <span class="annotated ">ORSV</span> was prevalent in orchids in the Zhejiang Province of China. 
<h3>20971202</h3>Ste50 adaptor protein governs sexual differentiation of <span class="annotated ">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> via the pheromone-response MAPK signaling pathway. <br><br>The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways control diverse cellular functions in pathogenic fungi, including sexual differentiation, stress response, and maintenance of cell wall integrity. Here we characterized a <span class="annotated ">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> gene, which is homologous to the <span class="unannotated ">yeast</span> Ste50 that is known to play an important role in mating pheromone response and stress response as an adaptor protein to the Ste11 MAPK kinase kinase in <span class="annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>. The <span class="annotated ">C. neoformans</span> Ste50 was not involved in any of the stress responses or virulence factor production (capsule and melanin) that are controlled by the HOG and Ras/cAMP signaling pathways. However, Ste50 was required for mating in both <span class="annotated ">serotype A</span> and <span class="annotated ">serotype D C. neoformans</span> strains. The ste50Delta mutant was completely defective in cell-cell fusion and mating pheromone production. Double mutation of the STE50 gene blocked increased production of pheromone and the hyper-filamentation phenotype of cells deleted of the CRG1 gene, which encodes the RGS protein that negatively regulates pheromone responsive G-protein signaling via the MAPK pathway. Regardless of the presence of the basidiomycota-specific SH3 domains of Ste50 that are known to be required for full virulence of <span class="annotated ">Ustilago maydis</span>, Ste50 was dispensable for virulence of <span class="annotated ">C. neoformans</span> in a <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">murine</span> model of cryptococcosis. In conclusion, the Ste50 adaptor protein controls sexual differentiation of <span class="annotated ">C. neoformans</span> via the pheromone-responsive MAPK pathway but is not required for virulence. 
<h3>21840413</h3>The effects of dsRNA mycoviruses on growth and <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">murine</span> virulence of <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus fumigatus</span>. <br><br>Some isolates of the opportunistic <span class="annotated ">human</span> pathogenic fungus <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus fumigatus</span> are known to be infected with mycoviruses. The dsRNA genomes of two of these mycoviruses, which include a chrysovirus and a partitivirus, have been completely sequenced and an RT-PCR assay for the viruses has been developed. Through curing virus-infected <span class="annotated ">A. fumigatus</span> isolates by cycloheximide treatment and transfecting virus-free isolates with purified <span class="unannotated ">virus</span>, as checked by RT-PCR, isogenic virus-free and virus-infected lines of the fungus were generated whose phenotypes and growth have been directly compared. Mycovirus infection of <span class="annotated ">A. fumigatus</span> with either the chrysovirus or the partitivirus resulted in significant aberrant phenotypic alterations and attenuation of growth of the fungus but had no effect on susceptibility to common antifungals. Chrysovirus infection of <span class="annotated ">A. fumigatus</span> caused no significant alterations to <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">murine</span> pathogenicity. 
<h3>20933542</h3>The rapid production of high-titer <span class="annotated ">porcine endogenous retrovirus</span>(PERV)-B env pseudotype and construction of an EGFP-expressing replication competent <span class="unannotated ">PERV-A</span> vector. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Porcine endogenous retroviruses</span> (<span class="annotated ">PERVs</span>) present a unique concern associated with xenotransplantation because they have been shown to infect certain <span class="annotated ">human</span> cells in vitro and it is also difficult to generate herds of <span class="annotated ">pigs</span> free of <span class="annotated ">PERVs</span>. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> simple system for the production of high-titer MoMLV-PERV pseudotypes is reported; an EGFP-expressing replication-competent molecular clone that allows direct measurement of titer was also constructed. To improve the MLV-based <span class="annotated ">retroviral</span> vector system, a 2.1-kb <span class="annotated ">PERV</span>-B env product was amplified from PK-15 genomic DNA and cloned into the pCL-Eco <span class="unannotated ">retroviral</span> vector. The titer of lacZ (<span class="annotated ">PERV-B</span>) from the 293 cells was about 1.0x10(4) CFU/ml. In contrast, the titer of lacZ (PERV-B) from a conventional <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">murine</span> <span class="annotated ">retroviral</span> vector (split genome) was found to be 1.2x10(2) CFU/ml when the <span class="annotated ">PERV-B</span> env expression vector was transfected into TELCeB6 cells, which harbor MFGnlslacZ and the gag-pol-expressing vector. In addition, an infectious <span class="annotated ">PERV-A</span> clone containing enhanced GFP (EGFP) by using a PCR-based method was developed. This EGFP-expressing PERV-A-IRES-EGFP molecular clone was found to be stable genetically on transfection in 293 cells.
