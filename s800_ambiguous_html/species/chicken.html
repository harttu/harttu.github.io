<h2>chicken</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20951166</h3>Rapid detection of <span class="annotated ">Newcastle disease virus</span> replication in embryonated <span class="match annotated ">chicken</span> eggs using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Newcastle disease virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">NDV</span>), an avian paramyxovirus, is an economically important disease of poultry globally. Rapid methods to detect and differentiate the virus are important to curtail the spread of this virus. Nucleic acid based detection methods are routinely employed for diagnosis that suffer from the disadvantage of failure to discriminate viable virus and non-infectious genome. However, virus isolation remains the gold standard for diagnosis of field outbreaks. The sensitivity of virus isolation was combined with nucleic acid based detection methods so that the time taken for confirmatory diagnosis could be considerably reduced while increasing sensitivity. Quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and conventional RT-PCR techniques were compared for the detection of <span class="annotated ">NDV</span> genome replication in 9-11-day-old embryonated <span class="match annotated ">chicken</span> eggs (ECE) using the nucleoprotein (NP) gene of the virus as a target. The results suggest that at least two to fourfold increase in cycle threshold (C(t)) values over the baseline C(t) value of samples lacking infectious virus, would indicate live <span class="annotated ">NDV</span> replication. The limit of detection of <span class="annotated ">NDV</span> replication using qRT-PCR was 1x10(4.0) mean embryo infective doses (EID(50)). The earliest time point when live virus replication was detectable by qRT-PCR or RT-PCR was 30h post-inoculation in ECE. 
<h3>20962090</h3><span class="annotated ">Marek's disease virus type 1</span> microRNA miR-M3 suppresses cisplatin-induced apoptosis by targeting Smad2 of the transforming growth factor beta signal pathway. <br><br>Viruses cause about 15% of the cancers that are still the leading causes of <span class="annotated ">human</span> mortality. The discovery of <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> oncogenes has enhanced our understanding of <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> oncogenesis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of virus-induced cancers are complex and require further investigation. The present study has attempted to investigate the effects of the microRNAs (miRNAs) encoded by <span class="annotated ">Marek's disease virus 1</span> (<span class="annotated ">MDV1</span>), a <span class="match unannotated ">chicken</span> herpesvirus causing acute T-cell lymphomas and solid visceral tumors in <span class="annotated ">chickens</span>, on anti-cancer drug-induced apoptosis and identify the targets of the miRNAs. The results showed that of the total 14 miRNAs encoded by <span class="annotated ">MDV1</span>, <span class="annotated ">MDV1</span>-miR-M3 significantly promoted cell survival under treatment with cisplatin, a widely used chemotherapy drug. <span class="annotated ">MDV1</span>-miR-M3 suppressed cisplatin-induced apoptosis by directly downregulating expression at the protein but not the mRNA level of Smad2, a critical component in the transforming growth factor Beta signal pathway. Our data suggest that latent/oncogenic <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span> may encode miRNAs to directly target cellular factors involved in antiviral processes including apoptosis, thus proactively creating a cellular environment beneficial to <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> latency and oncogenesis. Furthermore, the knowledge of the apoptosis resistance conferred by <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> miRNAs has great practical implications for improving the efficacy of chemotherapies for treating cancers, especially those induced by oncogenic <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span>. 
<h3>21815956</h3>Insertion of an intact CR1 retrotransposon in a cadherin gene linked with <span class="annotated ">Bt</span> resistance in the <span class="annotated ">pink bollworm</span>, <span class="annotated ">Pectinophora gossypiella</span>. <br><br>Three mutations in the <span class="annotated ">Pectinophora gossypiella</span> cadherin gene PgCad1 are linked with resistance to <span class="annotated ">Bacillus thuringiensis</span> (<span class="annotated ">Bt</span>) toxin Cry1Ac. Here we show that the r3 mutation entails recent insertion into PgCad1 of an active <span class="match annotated ">chicken</span> repeat (CR1) retrotransposon, designated CR1-1_Pg. Unlike most other CR1 elements, CR1-1_Pg is intact, transcribed by a flanking promoter, contains target site duplications and has a relatively low number of copies. Examination of transcripts from the PgCad1 locus revealed that CR1-1_Pg disrupts both the cadherin protein and a long noncoding RNA of unknown function. Together with previously reported data, these findings show that transposable elements disrupt eight of 12 cadherin alleles linked with resistance to Cry1Ac in three lepidopteran species, indicating that the cadherin locus is a common target for disruption by transposable elements. 
<h3>22182611</h3>Laboratory and Field Evaluation of Formulated <span class="annotated ">Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis</span> as a Feed Additive and Using Topical Applications for Control of <span class="annotated ">Musca domestica</span> (Diptera: Muscidae) Larvae in Caged-Poultry Manure. <br><br>Infestations of <span class="annotated ">house flies</span>, <span class="annotated ">Musca domestica</span> L., are a continual problem around poultry establishments. Acute toxicity of two commercial <span class="annotated ">Bacillus thuringiensis variety israelensis</span> (<span class="annotated ">Bti</span>) formulations (water-dispersible granules and bran formulation) was evaluated against larvae in the laboratory and against natural populations of <span class="annotated ">M. domestica</span> larvae in the field applied in feed to <span class="annotated ">chickens</span> and as topical applications in the poultry houses. Bioassay data showed that susceptibility of <span class="annotated ">M. domestica</span> larvae increased to a given concentration of <span class="annotated ">Bti</span> as the duration of exposure increased. In the laboratory studies, the LC(50) values of <span class="annotated ">Bti</span> for the larvae ranged between 65 and 77.4 mug/ml. In the field, a concentration of 10 g <span class="annotated ">Bti</span>/kg of feed resulted in 90% reduction of larvae at 4 wk after treatment. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> higher concentration (2 g/liter) of <span class="annotated ">Bti</span> in spray applications was not significantly more effective than the lower concentration of 1 g/liter. Adding <span class="annotated ">Bti</span> to <span class="match annotated ">chicken</span> feed is potentially an efficient measure for the management and control of <span class="annotated ">house flies</span> in caged-poultry facilities.
