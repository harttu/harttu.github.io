<h2>C. hominivorax</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21526934</h3>Factors of susceptibility of <span class="annotated ">human</span> myiasis caused by the <span class="annotated ">New World screw-worm</span>, <span class="annotated ">Cochliomyia hominivorax</span> in Sao Gonsigmaalo, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. <br><br>This study was carried out between July 2007 and June 2008 and reports on the occurrence of <span class="annotated ">human</span> myiasis caused by the New World screwworm, <span class="annotated ">Cochliomyia hominivorax</span> (Coquerel) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) in Sao Gonsigmaalo in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Liquid or solid vaseline was used to suffocate the larvae, which were then preserved in 70% ethanol and sent to the Instituto Oswaldo Cruz for identification. <span class="match annotated ">C. hominivorax</span> were identified in all 22 cases of myiasis. There were 12 male and 10 female <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> with ages ranging from 03 to 71. Ethnically the highest incidence was among <span class="unannotated ">black</span> <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">people</span>, with 17 cases. Open wounds were the main cause of the parasitosis, whereas poor personal hygiene, the low educational level, alcoholism, bedridden <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span>, and physical or mental disability were possibly secondary factors; in addition to all these factors the income of the <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> was very low.
