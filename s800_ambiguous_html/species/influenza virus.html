<h2>influenza virus</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20933017</h3>Adaptation of a Madin-Darby <span class="annotated ">canine</span> kidney cell line to suspension growth in serum-free media and comparison of its ability to produce avian <span class="match unannotated ">influenza virus</span> to Vero and BHK21 cell lines. <br><br>Madin-Darby <span class="annotated ">canine</span> kidney (MDCK) cells are currently considered for <span class="unannotated ">influenza</span> vaccine manufacturing. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> drawback of these cells is their anchorage dependent growth, which greatly complicates process scale-up. In this paper a novel MDCK cell line (MDCK-SFS) is described that grows efficiently in suspension and retained high expression levels of both alpha-2,6 and alpha-2,3 sialic acid receptors, which bind preferably to <span class="unannotated ">human</span> and avian <span class="unannotated ">influenza viruses</span>, respectively. The production of avian <span class="match unannotated ">influenza virus</span> by BHK21, Vero and MDCK-SFS cell lines was compared. Although BHK21 cells consisted of two populations, one of which lacks the alpha-2,3 receptor, they supported the replication of two <span class="unannotated ">influenza</span> strains to high titres. However, BHK21 cells are generally not applicable for <span class="unannotated ">influenza</span> production since they supported the replication of six further strains poorly. MDCK-SFS cells yielded the highest infectious <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> titres and <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> genome equivalent concentration for five of the eight <span class="unannotated ">influenza</span> strains analyzed and the highest hemagglutination activity for all eight <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> strains. Taken together with their suitability for suspension growth this makes the MDCK-SFS cell line potentially useful for large scale <span class="match unannotated ">influenza virus</span> production. 
<h3>20962084</h3>Modifications in the polymerase genes of a <span class="annotated ">swine</span>-like triple-reassortant <span class="match annotated ">influenza virus</span> to generate live attenuated vaccines against 2009 pandemic <span class="annotated ">H1N1 viruses</span>. <br><br>On 11 June 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the outbreaks caused by novel <span class="annotated ">swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus</span> had reached pandemic proportions. The pandemic <span class="unannotated ">H1N1</span> (H1N1pdm) <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> is the predominant <span class="match annotated ">influenza virus</span> strain in the <span class="annotated ">human</span> population. It has also crossed the species barriers and infected turkeys and <span class="annotated ">swine</span> in several countries. Thus, the development of a vaccine that is effective in multiple animal species is urgently needed. We have previously demonstrated that the introduction of temperature-sensitive mutations into the PB2 and PB1 genes of an avian <span class="annotated ">H9N2 virus</span>, combined with the insertion of a hemagglutinin (HA) tag in PB1, resulted in an attenuated (att) vaccine backbone for both <span class="annotated ">chickens</span> and <span class="unannotated ">mice</span>. Because the new pandemic strain is a triple-reassortant (TR) <span class="unannotated ">virus</span>, we chose to introduce the double attenuating modifications into a <span class="annotated ">swine</span>-like TR <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> isolate, <span class="annotated ">A/turkey/OH/313053/04 (H3N2)</span> (ty/04), with the goal of producing live attenuated <span class="unannotated ">influenza</span> vaccines (LAIV). This genetically modified backbone had impaired polymerase activity and restricted <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> growth at elevated temperatures. In vivo characterization of two <span class="annotated ">H1N1</span> vaccine candidates generated using the ty/04 att backbone demonstrated that this vaccine is highly attenuated in <span class="unannotated ">mice</span>, as indicated by the absence of signs of disease, limited replication, and minimum histopathological alterations in the respiratory tract. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> single immunization with the ty/04 att-based vaccines conferred complete protection against a lethal <span class="unannotated ">H1N1pdm</span> <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> infection in <span class="unannotated ">mice</span>. More importantly, vaccination of <span class="unannotated ">pigs</span> with a ty/04 att-H1N1 vaccine candidate resulted in sterilizing immunity upon an aggressive intratracheal challenge with the 2009 <span class="unannotated ">H1N1</span> pandemic <span class="unannotated ">virus</span>. Our studies highlight the safety of the ty/04 att vaccine platform and its potential as a master donor strain for the generation of live attenuated vaccines for <span class="annotated ">humans</span> and livestock. 
<h3>20970456</h3>Proteotyping to establish the lineage of <span class="annotated ">type A H1N1</span> and <span class="annotated ">type B human influenza virus</span>. <br><br>The ability to establish the lineage of <span class="annotated ">type A H1N1</span> and <span class="annotated ">type B human influenza virus</span> strains using a new proteotyping approach is demonstrated. Lineage-specific signature peptides have been determined for the hemagglutinin antigen of <span class="annotated ">type A H1N1</span> and <span class="annotated ">type B influenza viruses</span>. The detection of these peptides alone within the high resolution mass spectra of whole antigen digests enables the lineage of the strain to be rapidly and unequivocally assigned. This proteotyping approach complements conventional PCR approaches and should aid in the monitoring of the evolution of the <span class="match annotated ">influenza virus</span> in both <span class="annotated ">humans</span> and animals. 
<h3>20980507</h3>Successful vaccination strategies that protect aged <span class="annotated ">mice</span> from lethal challenge from <span class="match unannotated ">influenza virus</span> and heterologous <span class="annotated ">severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus</span>. <br><br>Newly emerging viruses often circulate as a heterogeneous swarm in wild animal reservoirs prior to their emergence in <span class="annotated ">humans</span>, and their antigenic identities are often unknown until an outbreak situation. The newly emerging <span class="annotated ">severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus</span> (<span class="annotated ">SARS-CoV</span>) and reemerging <span class="match unannotated ">influenza virus</span> cause disproportionate disease in the aged, who are also notoriously difficult to successfully vaccinate, likely due to immunosenescence. To protect against future emerging strains, vaccine platforms should induce broad cross-reactive immunity that is sufficient to protect from homologous and heterologous challenge in all ages. From initial studies, we hypothesized that attenuated <span class="annotated ">Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">VEE</span>) replicon particle (VRP) vaccine glycoproteins mediated vaccine failure in the aged. We then compared the efficacies of vaccines bearing attenuated (VRP(3014)) or wild-type <span class="annotated ">VEE</span> glycoproteins (VRP(3000)) in young and aged <span class="annotated ">mice</span> within novel models of severe <span class="annotated ">SARS-CoV</span> pathogenesis. Aged animals receiving VRP(3000)-based vaccines were protected from <span class="annotated ">SARS-CoV</span> disease, while animals receiving the VRP(3014)-based vaccines were not. The superior protection for the aged observed with VRP(3000)-based vaccines was confirmed in a lethal <span class="match unannotated ">influenza virus</span> challenge model. While the VRP(3000) vaccine's immune responses in the aged were sufficient to protect against lethal homologous and heterologous challenge, our data suggest that innate defects within the VRP(3014) platform mediate vaccine failure. Exploration into the mechanism(s) of successful vaccination in the immunosenescent should aid in the development of successful vaccine strategies for other <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> diseases disproportionately affecting the elderly, like <span class="annotated ">West Nile virus</span>, <span class="match unannotated ">influenza virus</span>, norovirus, or other emerging viruses of the future. 
<h3>20980523</h3>T cell-mediated protection against <span class="annotated ">lethal 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus</span> infection in a <span class="unannotated ">mouse</span> model. <br><br>Genetic mutation and reassortment of <span class="match annotated ">influenza virus</span> gene segments, in particular those of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), that lead to antigenic drift and shift are the major strategies for <span class="match annotated ">influenza virus</span> to escape preexisting immunity. The most recent example of such phenomena is the first pandemic of <span class="annotated ">H1N1 influenza</span> of the 21st century, which started in 2009. Cross-reactive antibodies raised against <span class="annotated ">H1N1 viruses</span> circulating before 1930 show protective activity against the <span class="annotated ">2009 pandemic virus</span>. Cross-reactive T-cell responses can also contribute to protection, but in vivo support of this view is lacking. To explore the protection mechanisms in vivo, we primed <span class="unannotated ">mice</span> with <span class="annotated ">H1</span> and <span class="annotated ">H3 influenza virus</span> isolates and rechallenged them with a <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> derived from the <span class="annotated ">2009 H1N1 A/CA/04/09 virus</span>, named CA/E3/09. We found that priming with <span class="unannotated ">influenza viruses</span> of both <span class="annotated ">H1</span> and H3 homo- and heterosubtypes protected against lethal CA/E3/09 <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> challenge. Convalescent-phase sera from these primed <span class="unannotated ">mice</span> conferred no neutralization activity in vitro and no protection in vivo. However, T-cell depletion studies suggested that both CD4 and CD8 T cells contributed to the protection. Taken together, these results indicate that cross-reactive T cells established after initial priming with distally related viruses can be a vital component for prevention of disease and control of <span class="annotated ">pandemic H1N1 influenza virus</span> infection. Our results highlight the importance of establishing cross-reactive T-cell responses for protecting against existing or newly emerging pandemic <span class="unannotated ">influenza viruses</span>. 
<h3>20980508</h3>Norovirus GII.4 strain antigenic variation.<br><br>Noroviruses are the principal cause of epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide. Multiple reports have concluded that the major capsid proteins of GII.4 strains, which cause 80% of norovirus infections worldwide, are evolving rapidly, resulting in new epidemic strains. Surrogate neutralization assays using sera from outbreaks and from immunized <span class="unannotated ">mice</span> suggest that, as with <span class="match annotated ">influenza virus</span>, antigenic variation maintains GII.4 persistence in the face of <span class="annotated ">human</span> population herd immunity. To test this hypothesis, <span class="unannotated ">mice</span> were hyperimmunized with virus-like particles (VLPs) representing an early (GII.4-1987) and a contemporary (GII.4-2006) GII.4 strain. Anti-GII.4-1987 IgG monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) strongly reacted with GII.4 VLPs derived between only 1987 and 2002. Ligand binding blockade was more efficient with GII.4-1987 and GII.4-1997 VLPs than with GII.4-2002. Anti-GII.4-2006 IgG MAbs recognized either a broad panel of GII.4 VLPs (1987 to 2006) or a subset of contemporary (2004 to 2006) VLPs. Most 2006 antibodies did not recognize or only poorly recognized GII.4 VLPs of 2007 or 2008, documenting rapid antigenic evolution of GII.4 capsids. Generally, 2006 MAbs blocked homotypic VLP-ligand binding but were unable to block VLPs representing strains primarily circulating during or earlier than 2002. These analyses demonstrate that both subtle and significant evolutionary change has occurred within antibody epitopes between epidemic strains, providing direct evidence that the GII.4 noroviruses are undergoing antigenic variation, likely in response to herd immunity. As with <span class="match annotated ">influenza virus</span>, <span class="unannotated ">HIV</span>, and <span class="annotated ">hepatitis C virus</span>, norovirus antigenic variation will significantly influence the design of efficacious vaccines and immunotherapeutics against these important <span class="annotated ">human</span> pathogens.
