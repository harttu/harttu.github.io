<h2>H5N1</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20962087</h3>The magnitude of local immunity in the lungs of <span class="annotated ">mice</span> induced by live attenuated influenza vaccines is determined by local <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> replication and induction of cytokines. <br><br>While live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) have been shown to be efficacious and have been licensed for <span class="annotated ">human</span> use, the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) have to be updated for optimal protective efficacy. Little is known about the effect of different HA and NA proteins on the immunogenicity of LAIVs developed using the same backbone. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> panel of LAIVs that share the internal protein genes, with unique HA and NA gene segments from different influenza subtypes, was rescued by reverse genetics, and a comparative study of immune responses induced by these vaccines was conducted in <span class="annotated ">mice</span>. The results suggest that the magnitude of lung immunity, including pulmonary IgA antibody and memory CD8(+) T lymphocytes, induced by the vaccines depends on the replication efficiency of the LAIVs, as well as the induction of cytokines/chemokines in the lungs. However, these factors are not important in determining systemic immunity such as serum antibody titers and memory CD8(+) T cells in the spleen. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> qualitative analysis of immune responses induced by a single dose of an <span class="match annotated ">H5N1</span> LAIV revealed that the vaccine induced robust systemic and mucosal immunity in <span class="annotated ">mice</span>. In addition, antibodies and memory lymphocytes established in the lungs following vaccination were required for protection against lethal challenge with homologous and heterologous <span class="annotated ">H5N1 viruses</span>. Our results highlight the different requirements for inducing systemic and lung immunity that can be explored for the development of pulmonary immunity for protection against respiratory pathogens. 
<h3>21047957</h3>Modification of nonstructural protein 1 of <span class="annotated ">influenza A virus</span> by SUMO1.<br><br>Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is one of the major factors resulting in the efficient infection rate and high level of virulence of <span class="annotated ">influenza A virus</span>. Although consisting of only approximately 230 amino acids, NS1 has the ability to interfere with several systems of the host <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> defense. In the present study, we demonstrate that NS1 of the highly pathogenic avian <span class="annotated ">influenza A/Duck/Hubei/L-1/2004 (H5N1) virus</span> interacts with <span class="annotated ">human</span> Ubc9, which is the E2 conjugating enzyme for sumoylation, and we show that SUMO1 is conjugated to <span class="match annotated ">H5N1</span> NS1 in both transfected and infected cells. Furthermore, two lysine residues in the C terminus of NS1 were identified as SUMO1 acceptor sites. When the SUMO1 acceptor sites were removed by mutation, NS1 underwent rapid degradation. Studies of different <span class="annotated ">influenza A virus</span> strains of <span class="annotated ">human</span> and avian origin showed that the majority of <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span> possess an NS1 protein that is modified by SUMO1, except for the recently emerged <span class="annotated ">swine-origin influenza A virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">S-OIV</span>) (H1N1). Interestingly, growth of a sumoylation-deficient WSN virus mutant was retarded compared to that of wild-type virus. Together, these results indicate that sumoylation enhances NS1 stability and thus promotes rapid growth of <span class="annotated ">influenza A virus</span>.
