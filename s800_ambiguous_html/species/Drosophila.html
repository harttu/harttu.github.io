<h2>Drosophila</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20854481</h3>Functional test of the influence of Wolbachia genes on cytoplasmic incompatibility expression in <span class="annotated ">Drosophila melanogaster</span>. <br><br>Wolbachia are inherited intracellular bacteria that infect a broad range of invertebrate hosts. They commonly manipulate host reproduction in a variety of ways and thereby favour their invasion into host populations. While the biology of Wolbachia has been extensively studied at the ecological and phenotypic level, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between Wolbachia and their hosts. Recent comparative genomics studies of Wolbachia strains have revealed putative candidate genes involved in the expression of cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) in insects. However the functional testing of these genes is hindered by the lack of available genetic tools in Wolbachia. To circumvent this problem we generated transgenic <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">Drosophila</span> lines expressing various Wolbachia CI candidate genes under the control of the GAL4/UAS system in order to evaluate their possible role in Wolbachia-related phenotypes in <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">Drosophila</span>. The expression of a number of these genes in <span class="annotated ">Drosophila melanogaster</span> failed to mimic or alter CI phenotypes across a range of Wolbachia backgrounds or in the absence of Wolbachia. 
<h3>21029232</h3>Hormone receptor-like in 96 and Broad-Complex modulate phenobarbital induced transcription of cytochrome P450 CYP6D1 in <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">Drosophila</span> S2 cells. <br><br>Phenobarbital (PB) is a prototypical inducer for studies of xenobiotic responses in animals. In mammals, the nuclear receptors constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) have been identified as key transcription factors regulating PB induced transcription of xenobiotic responsive genes. In insects, much less is known about the transcription factors involved in regulating PB induced transcription, although CAR and PXR have a single orthologue hormone receptor-like in 96 (HR96) in <span class="annotated ">Drosophila melanogaster</span>. Using dual luciferase reporter assays in <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">Drosophila</span> Schneider (S2) cells, constructs containing variable lengths of the promoter of the PB inducible cytochrome P450 CYP6D1 were evaluated in the presence and absence of PB. The promoter region between -330 and -280 (relative to the position of transcription start site, +1) was found to be critical for PB induction. Putative binding sites for <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">Drosophila</span> Broad-Complex (BR-C) and deformed (Dfd) were identified within this promoter region using TFsearch. RNA interference (RNAi) treatment of S2 cells in conjunction with CYP6D1 promoter assays showed that suppression of <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">Drosophila</span> HR96 and BR-C transcription in S2 cells resulted in a significant decrease and increase, respectively, of PB induction. Effects of HR96 and BR-C in mediating PB induction were PB specific and PB dependent. This represents new functional evidence that <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">Drosophila</span> HR96 and BR-C can act as an activator and repressor, respectively, in regulating PB induced transcription in insects. 
<h3>21166911</h3>Conserved function of the Kruppel gap gene in the blowfly <span class="annotated ">Lucilia sericata</span>, despite anterior shift of expression. <br><br>To determine whether expression patterns of segmentation genes found in <span class="annotated ">Drosophila melanogaster</span> can be scaled to pattern larger insects, we studied the expression of the Kruppel (Kr) gene in the blowfly <span class="annotated ">Lucilia sericata</span>. Compared with <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">Drosophila</span> Kr, <span class="annotated ">L. sericata</span> Kr showed an unexpected 10% shift of expression towards the anterior pole. Furthermore, expression domains not found in <span class="annotated ">D. melanogaster</span> were present at the blastoderm stage of <span class="annotated ">L. sericata</span>. To compare Kr activity and function, we employed RNA interference-mediated gene silencing. We found Kr phenotypes in <span class="annotated ">L. sericata</span> comparable with those observed in <span class="annotated ">D. melanogaster</span>, demonstrating that <span class="annotated ">L. sericata</span> Kr functions as a gap gene as it does in <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">Drosophila</span>. Our results show that, despite an anterior shift in expression, Kr function has remained conserved during the evolution of the blowflies. 
<h3>21410804</h3>Genome-wide analysis of brain transcriptional changes in <span class="annotated ">honey bee</span> (<span class="annotated ">Apis mellifera</span> L.) queens exposed to carbon dioxide and physical manipulation. <br><br>Mating is a complex process causing many behavioural and physiological changes, but the factors triggering them and the underlying molecular processes are not well characterized. In the present study we examine the effects of CO(2) (a commonly used anaesthetic in instrumental insemination that causes changes similar to those occurring after mating) and physical manipulation (which may mimic certain aspects of copulation) on the behavioural, physiological and brain transcriptional changes in <span class="annotated ">honey bee</span> queens. We show that while CO(2) causes cessation of mating flights and ovary activation, physical manipulation has additional effects on ovary activation and brain transcriptional changes. Comparisons with previous studies of <span class="annotated ">honey bees</span> and female <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">Drosophila</span> indicate that common molecular mechanisms may be responsible for regulating reproductive changes across different mating regimes and insect orders. 
<h3>21672063</h3>Transcript analysis and comparative evaluation of shaker and slowmo gene homologues from the <span class="annotated ">European corn borer</span>, <span class="annotated ">Ostrinia nubilalis</span>. <br><br>The movement and dispersal of larval Lepidoptera impact their survival and distribution within the natural landscape. Homologues of the <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">Drosophila</span> behaviour-linked genes shaker (shkr) and slowmo (slmo) were identified from <span class="annotated ">Ostrinia nubilalis</span> (Lepidoptera: Crambidae). Onshkr was isolated as a 1610-nucleotide (nt) constitutively expressed transcript encoding a membrane-localized 469-amino-acid (aa) protein with a conserved tetramerization domain and the six-domain architecture necessary for the molecule to fold into an active K(+) channel. Three expressed splice variants of 682, 970 and 1604 nt were identified for the Onslmo gene, and encode predicted 141 and 228 aa proteins with a conserved protein of relevant evolutionary and lymphoid interest (PRELI) domain that may function in mitochondrial protein sorting and perinuclear protein localization. Onshkr and Onslmo protein sequences aligned within monophyletic lepidopteran groups. 
<h3>21699597</h3>Identification and expression analysis of the genes involved in serotonin biosynthesis and transduction in the field cricket <span class="annotated ">Gryllus bimaculatus</span>. <br><br>Serotonin (5-HT) modulates various aspects of behaviours such as aggressive behaviour and circadian behaviour in the cricket. To elucidate the molecular basis of the cricket 5-HT system, we identified 5-HT-related genes in the field cricket <span class="annotated ">Gryllus bimaculatus</span> DeGeer. Complementary DNA of tryptophan hydroxylase and phenylalanine-tryptophan hydroxylase, which convert tryptophan into 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan (5-HTP), and that of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, which converts 5-HTP into 5-HT, were isolated from a cricket brain cDNA library. In addition, four 5-HT receptor genes (5-HT(1A) , 5-HT(1B) , 5-HT(2alpha) , and 5-HT(7) ) were identified. Expression analysis of the tryptophan hydroxylase gene TRH and phenylalanine-tryptophan hydroxylase gene TPH, which are selectively involved in neuronal and peripheral 5-HT synthesis in <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">Drosophila</span>, suggested that two 5-HT synthesis pathways co-exist in the cricket neuronal tissues. The four 5-HT receptor genes were expressed in various tissues at differential expression levels, suggesting that the 5-HT system is widely distributed in the cricket.
