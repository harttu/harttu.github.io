<h2>Fusarium graminearum</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20955812</h3>Paralogous cyp51 genes in <span class="match annotated ">Fusarium graminearum</span> mediate differential sensitivity to sterol demethylation inhibitors. <br><br>Analysis of the genome sequence of <span class="match annotated ">Fusarium graminearum</span> revealed three paralogous cyp51 genes (designated cyp51A, -B, and -C) encoding 14-alpha demethylases in this fungus. Targeted gene disruption showed that the cyp51A, -B or -C disruption mutants were morphologically indistinguishable from the parent isolate on <span class="annotated ">potato</span> dextrose agar medium, which indicates that none of these genes is essential for mycelial growth. The sensitivity of cyp51A deletion mutants to seven sterol demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicides increased significantly compared to the parent strain, while sensitivity of cyp51C deletion mutants increased to some but not all DMIs. No change in DMI sensitivity was observed for cyp51B deletion mutants. The parental phenotypes of cyp51A and cyp51C deletion mutants were completely restored by genetic complementation with the wild-type cyp51A and cyp51C genes, respectively. The sensitivity of <span class="annotated ">F. graminearum</span> isolates increased significantly when subjected in vitro to a mixture of DMI fungicides triadimefon and tebuconazole as compared to the individual components. These results indicate that different DMI fungicides target different CYP51 proteins in <span class="annotated ">F. graminearum</span> and that a mixture of DMI fungicides can result in synergistic effects. Our findings have directly implications on chemical management strategies of plant diseases caused by Fusarium species. 
<h3>21126599</h3>The pH regulatory factor Pac1 regulates Tri gene expression and trichothecene production in <span class="match annotated ">Fusarium graminearum</span>. <br><br>Fungi manage the adaptation to extra-cellular pH through the PacC transcription factor, a key component of the pH regulatory system. PacC regulates the production of various secondary metabolites in filamentous fungi. In the important cereal pathogen <span class="match annotated ">Fusarium graminearum</span>, the production of trichothecene is induced only under acidic pH conditions. Here, we examined the role of the PacC homologue from <span class="annotated ">F. graminearum</span>, FgPac1, on the regulation of trichothecene production. An FgDeltaPac1 deletion mutant was constructed in <span class="annotated ">F. graminearum</span> which showed a reduced development under neutral and alkaline pH, increased sensitivity to H(2)O(2) and an earlier Tri gene induction and toxin accumulation at acidic pH. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> strain expressing the FgPac1(c) constitutively active form of Pac1 exhibited a strongly repressed Tri gene expression and reduced toxin accumulation at acidic pH. These results demonstrate that Pac1 negatively regulates Tri gene expression and toxin production in <span class="annotated ">F. graminearum</span>. 
<h3>21397712</h3>Npc1 is involved in sterol trafficking in the filamentous fungus <span class="match annotated ">Fusarium graminearum</span>. <br><br>The ortholog of the <span class="annotated ">human</span> gene NPC1 was identified in the plant pathogenic, filamentous fungus <span class="match annotated ">Fusarium graminearum</span> by shared amino acid sequence, protein domain structure and cellular localization of the mature fungal protein. The FusariumNpc1 gene shares 34% amino acid sequence identity and 51% similarity to the <span class="annotated ">human</span> gene, has similar domain structure and is constitutively expressed, although up-regulated in ungerminated macroconidia and ascospores. GFP-tagged Npc1p localizes to the fungal vacuolar membrane. Cultures derived from a Deltanpc1 mutant strain contain significantly more ergosterol than cultures of the wildtype. Staining with the fluorescent, sterol binding dye filipin, shows that ergosterol accumulates in vacuoles of the Deltanpc1 mutant but not the wildtype strain. The Deltanpc1 mutant has a temperature dependent reduction in growth and greater sensitivity to the ergosterol synthesis inhibiting fungicide tebuconazole compared with the wildtype strain or the mutant complemented with wildtype Npc1. The mutant also is significantly reduced in pathogenicity to <span class="annotated ">wheat</span>. Our results are consistent with the interpretation that Npc1p is important for normal transport of ergosterol from the vacuole and is essential for proper membrane function under particular environmental conditions. 
<h3>21601644</h3>Analysis of the <span class="match annotated ">Fusarium graminearum</span> species complex from <span class="annotated ">wheat</span>, <span class="annotated ">barley</span> and <span class="annotated ">maize</span> in South Africa provides evidence of species-specific differences in host preference. <br><br>Species identity and trichothecene toxin potential of 560 members of the <span class="match annotated ">Fusarium graminearum</span> species complex (<span class="annotated ">FGSC</span>) collected from diseased <span class="annotated ">wheat</span>, <span class="annotated ">barley</span> and <span class="annotated ">maize</span> in South Africa was determined using a microsphere-based multilocus genotyping assay. Although three trichothecene types (3-ADON, 15-ADON and NIV) were represented among these isolates, strains with the 15-ADON type predominated on all three hosts. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> significant difference, however, was identified in the composition of <span class="annotated ">FGSC</span> pathogens associated with Gibberella ear rot (GER) of <span class="annotated ">maize</span> as compared to Fusarium head blight (FHB) of <span class="annotated ">wheat</span> or <span class="annotated ">barley</span> (P&lt;0.001). <span class="annotated ">F. graminearum</span> accounted for more than 85% of the <span class="annotated ">FGSC</span> isolates associated with FHB of <span class="annotated ">wheat</span> and <span class="annotated ">barley</span> (N=425), and was also the dominant species among isolates from <span class="annotated ">maize</span> roots (N=35). However, with the exception of a single isolate identified as an interspecific hybrid between <span class="annotated ">Fusariumboothii</span> and <span class="annotated ">F. graminearum</span>, GER of <span class="annotated ">maize</span> (N=100) was exclusively associated with <span class="annotated ">F. boothii</span>. The predominance of <span class="annotated ">F. graminearum</span> among FHB isolates, and the near exclusivity of <span class="annotated ">F. boothii</span> among GER isolates, was observed across all cultivars, collection dates, and provinces sampled. Because these results suggest a difference in host preference among species of the <span class="annotated ">FGSC</span>, we hypothesize that <span class="annotated ">F. graminearum</span> may be less well adapted to infect <span class="annotated ">maize</span> ears than other members of the <span class="annotated ">FGSC</span>. 
<h3>22004876</h3>Novel Fusarium head blight pathogens from Nepal and Louisiana revealed by multilocus genealogical concordance. <br><br>This study was conducted to assess evolutionary relationships, species diversity and trichothecene toxin potential of five <span class="match annotated ">Fusarium graminearum</span> complex (<span class="annotated ">FGSC</span>) isolates identified as genetically novel during prior Fusarium head blight (FHB) surveys in Nepal and Louisiana. Results of a multilocus genotyping (MLGT) assay for B-trichothecene species determination indicated these isolates might represent novel species within the <span class="annotated ">FGSC</span>. GCPSR-based phylogenetic analyses of a 12-gene dataset, comprising portions of seven loci totaling 13.1kb of aligned DNA sequence data, provided strong support for the genealogical exclusivity of the Nepalese and Louisianan isolates. Accordingly, both species are formally recognized herein as novel <span class="annotated ">FGSC</span> species. <span class="annotated ">Fusarium nepalense</span> was resolved as the sister lineage of <span class="annotated ">Fusarium ussurianum</span>+<span class="annotated ">Fusarium asiaticum</span> within an Asian subclade of the <span class="annotated ">FGSC</span>. <span class="annotated ">Fusarium louisianense</span> was strongly supported as a reciprocally monophyletic sister of <span class="annotated ">Fusarium gerlachii</span>+<span class="annotated ">F. graminearum</span>, suggesting that this subclade might be endemic to North America. Multilocus Bayesian species tree analyses augment these results and provide evidence for a distinct lineage within <span class="annotated ">F. graminearum</span> predominately from the Gulf Coast of Louisiana. As predicted by the MLGT assay, mycotoxin analyses demonstrated that <span class="annotated ">F. nepalense</span> and <span class="annotated ">F. louisianense</span> could produce 15ADON and nivalenol, respectively, in planta. In addition, both species were only able to induce mild FHB symptoms on <span class="annotated ">wheat</span> in pathogenicity experiments.
