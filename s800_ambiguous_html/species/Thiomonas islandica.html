<h2>Thiomonas islandica</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20173005</h3><span class="match annotated ">Thiomonas islandica</span> sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic, hydrogen- and sulfur-oxidizing <span class="annotated ">betaproteobacterium</span> isolated from a hot spring. <br><br>A novel, hydrogen- and sulfur-oxidizing bacterium, designated strain <span class="annotated ">6C</span>(T), was isolated from a hot spring in Graendalur, south-western Iceland. Cells of this organism were Gram-reaction-negative, rod-shaped and motile. The strain grew aerobically and was capable of chemolithotrophic growth on thiosulfate and hydrogen, heterotrophic growth on pyruvate, oxalate, acetate and on glutamate in the presence of <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">yeast</span> extract and mixotrophic growth on several organic compounds, thiosulfate and/or hydrogen. During growth on thiosulfate, the final product was sulfate, resulting in a drop in pH from 6.8 to 2.7. Heterotrophic growth on pyruvate was observed at pH 4-7 (optimum pH 4) and 35-50 ^0C (optimum 45 ^0C). The DNA G+C content was 65.2 mol%. As determined by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain <span class="annotated ">6C</span>(T) represents a distinct species belonging to the class <span class="annotated ">Betaproteobacteria</span> and is most closely related to <span class="annotated ">Thiomonas intermedia DSM 18155</span>(T) and <span class="annotated ">Thiomonas perometabolis DSM 18570</span>(T). DNA-DNA hybridization between strain <span class="annotated ">6C</span>(T) and <span class="annotated ">Thiomonas intermedia DSM 18155</span>(T) and <span class="annotated ">Thiomonas perometabolis DSM 18570</span>(T) gave relatedness values below 32 %. These results, together with physiological characteristics, showed that strain <span class="annotated ">6C</span>(T) represents a novel species within the genus Thiomonas, for which the name <span class="match annotated ">Thiomonas islandica</span> sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is <span class="annotated ">6C</span>(T) (=<span class="annotated ">DSM 21436</span>(T) =<span class="annotated ">JCM 16107</span>(T)).
