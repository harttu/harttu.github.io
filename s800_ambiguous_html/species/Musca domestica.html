<h2>Musca domestica</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEAUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20923688</h3>Universal primers for rapid detection of hytrosaviruses.<br><br>Hytrosaviridae is a proposed <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> family encompassing viruses that cause salivary gland hypertrophy (SGH) syndrome in infected insects and reduce the fertility in their dipteran insect hosts. They contain a large, double stranded DNA genome of 120-190 kbp. To date, these viruses have been detected only in adult Diptera. These include hytrosaviruses detected in various tsetse <span class="linneaus_only ">fly</span> species (Glossina spp.), the <span class="annotated ">narcissus bulb fly</span> <span class="annotated ">Merodon equestris</span> and the <span class="annotated ">house fly</span> <span class="match annotated ">Musca domestica</span>. The limited number of hytrosaviruses reported to date may be a reflection of the frequent absence of external symptoms in infected adult <span class="linneaus_only ">flies</span> and the fact that the <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> does not cause rapid mortality. Based on the complete genome sequence of <span class="annotated ">Glossinia pallidipes</span> (GpSGHV) and <span class="match annotated ">Musca domestica</span> (MdSGHV) salivary gland hypertrophy viruses, a PCR based methodology was developed to detect the viruses in these species. To be able to detect hytrosaviruses in other Diptera, five degenerate primer pairs were designed and tested on GpSGHV and MdSGHV DNA using gradient PCR with annealing temperatures from 37 to 61^0C. Two pairs of primers were selected from p74, two pairs from PIF-1 and one pair from ODV-e66 homologous proteins. Four primer pairs generated a <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> specific PCR product on both MdSGHV and GpSGHV at all tested annealing temperatures, while the ODV-e66 based primers did not generate a <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> specific product with annealing temperatures higher that 47^0C. No non-specific PCR product was found when using genomic DNA of infected <span class="linneaus_only ">flies</span> as template DNA. These results offer new sets of primers that could be used to detect hytrosaviruses in other insects. 
<h3>21711401</h3>Identification and characterization of the cysteine protease inhibitor gene MdCPI from <span class="match annotated ">Musca domestica</span>. <br><br>Cysteine proteinase inhibitors (CPIs) are involved in many vital cellular processes such as signalling pathways, apoptosis, immune response and development; however, no CPIs have yet been reported from the <span class="annotated ">housefly</span> <span class="match annotated ">Musca domestica</span>. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a <span class="annotated ">housefly</span> CPI gene designated MdCPI. The gene contains an open reading frame of 357 bp encoding a protein of 118 amino acid residues with a putative signal peptide of 17 amino acid residues. Protein alignment demonstrated a high homology to that of <span class="annotated ">Sarcophaga crassipalpis</span> (identity = 51%). Phylogenetic analysis suggested that all CPIs from dipterans, including the <span class="annotated ">housefly</span>, belong to the I25A family and may be descended from a single common ancestor. The gene was expressed in and purified from <span class="annotated ">Escherichia coli</span>. Biochemical studies showed that MdCPI exerts an inhibiting function on papain, which is a classical assay to confirm CPIs. Real-time quantitative PCR and immunolocalization analysis revealed that MdCPI is specifically expressed in haemocytes and fat bodies. It is highly down-regulated in larvae and markedly up-regulated in the pupal stage, suggesting that it may be related to development. 
<h3>22182611</h3>Laboratory and Field Evaluation of Formulated <span class="annotated ">Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis</span> as a Feed Additive and Using Topical Applications for Control of <span class="match annotated ">Musca domestica</span> (Diptera: Muscidae) Larvae in Caged-Poultry Manure. <br><br>Infestations of <span class="annotated ">house flies</span>, <span class="match annotated ">Musca domestica</span> L., are a continual problem around <span class="unannotated ">poultry</span> establishments. Acute toxicity of two commercial <span class="annotated ">Bacillus thuringiensis variety israelensis</span> (<span class="annotated ">Bti</span>) formulations (water-dispersible granules and bran formulation) was evaluated against larvae in the laboratory and against natural populations of <span class="annotated ">M. domestica</span> larvae in the field applied in feed to <span class="annotated ">chickens</span> and as topical applications in the <span class="unannotated ">poultry</span> houses. Bioassay data showed that susceptibility of <span class="annotated ">M. domestica</span> larvae increased to a given concentration of <span class="annotated ">Bti</span> as the duration of exposure increased. In the laboratory studies, the LC(50) values of <span class="annotated ">Bti</span> for the larvae ranged between 65 and 77.4 mug/ml. In the field, a concentration of 10 g <span class="annotated ">Bti</span>/kg of feed resulted in 90% reduction of larvae at 4 wk after treatment. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> higher concentration (2 g/liter) of <span class="annotated ">Bti</span> in spray applications was not significantly more effective than the lower concentration of 1 g/liter. Adding <span class="annotated ">Bti</span> to <span class="annotated ">chicken</span> feed is potentially an efficient measure for the management and control of <span class="annotated ">house flies</span> in caged-poultry facilities.
