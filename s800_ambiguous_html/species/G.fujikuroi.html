<h2>G.fujikuroi</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21453780</h3>Structure and evolution of the Fusarium mating type locus: new insights from the <span class="annotated ">Gibberellafujikuroi</span> complex. <br><br>Mating type genes are central to sexual reproduction and compatibility in Ascomycete fungi. However the &quot;MAT&quot; loci experience unique evolutionary pressures that can result in rapid divergence and enhanced inter-specific gene-flow (lateral gene transfer). In this study, molecular evolution of MAT loci was considered using the genus Fusarium (Teleomorph: Gibberella) as a model. Both MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 &quot;idiomorphs&quot; from eleven species of the <span class="annotated ">Gibberellafujikuroi</span> species complex were sequenced. Molecular evolution of the MAT loci from these heterothallic (self-sterile) species was compared with that of the MAT loci from nine homothallic (self-fertile) species in the <span class="annotated ">Fusariumgraminearum</span> species complex. Although Fusarium has previously been thought to have the same complement of four MAT genes that are found in Neurospora, we found evidence of a novel gene, MAT1-2-3, that may be specific to the Hypocreales. All MAT genes share a similar set of cis-regulatory motifs, although homothallic species might have recruited novel regulatory elements, which could potentially facilitate alternate expression of MAT1-1-1 and MAT1-2-1. FusariumMAT loci displayed evidence consistent with historical lateral gene-flow. Most notably, the MAT1-1 idiomorph of <span class="annotated ">Fusariumsacchari</span> appears to be unrelated to those of other species in the <span class="match annotated ">G.fujikuroi</span> complex. In general, FusariumMAT genes are highly divergent. Both positive selection and relaxed selective constraint could account for this phenomenon. However, the extent of both recombination and inter-specific gene-flow in the MAT locus also appears to affect the rate of divergence.
