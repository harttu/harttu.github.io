<h2>Delphacodes kuscheli</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21529147</h3>Growth inhibition of <span class="annotated ">Beauveria bassiana</span> by bacteria isolated from the cuticular surface of the <span class="annotated ">corn leafhopper</span>, <span class="annotated ">Dalbulus maidis</span> and the planthopper, <span class="match annotated ">Delphacodes kuscheli</span>, two important vectors of <span class="annotated ">maize</span> pathogens. <br><br>The phytosanitary importance of the <span class="annotated ">corn leafhopper</span>, <span class="annotated ">Dalbulus maidis</span> (De Long and Wolcott) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) and the planthopper, <span class="match annotated ">Delphacodes kuscheli</span> Fennah (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) lies in their ability to transmit phloem-associated plant pathogens, mainly <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span> and mollicutes, and to cause considerable mechanical damage to <span class="annotated ">corn</span> plants during feeding and oviposition. Fungi, particularly some members of the Ascomycota, are likely candidates for biocontrol agents against these insect pests, but several studies revealed their failure to invade the insect cuticle possibly because of the presence of inhibitory compounds such as phenols, quinones, and lipids and also by the antibiosis effect of the microbiota living on the cuticular surface of the host. The present work aims to understand interactions between the entomopathogenic fungus <span class="annotated ">Beauveria bassiana</span> (Balsamao-Crivelli) Vuillemin (Hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae) and bacterial antagonists isolated from the cuticular surface of <span class="annotated ">D. maidis</span> and <span class="annotated ">D. kuscheli</span>. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> total of 155 bacterial isolates were recovered from the insect's cuticle and tested against <span class="annotated ">B. bassiana</span>. Ninety-one out of 155 strains inhibited the growth of <span class="annotated ">B. bassiana</span>. Bacterial strains isolated from <span class="annotated ">D. maidis</span> were significantly more antagonistic against <span class="annotated ">B. bassiana</span> than those isolates from <span class="annotated ">D. kuscheli</span>. Among the most effective antagonistic strains, six isolates of <span class="annotated ">Bacillus thuringiensis</span> Berliner (Bacillales: Bacillaeae (after <span class="annotated ">B. subtilis</span>)), one isolate of <span class="annotated ">B. mycoides</span> Flugge, eight isolates of <span class="annotated ">B. megaterium</span> de Bary, five isolates of <span class="annotated ">B.pumilus</span> Meyer and Gottheil, one isolate of <span class="annotated ">B. licheniformis</span> (Weigmann) Chester, and four isolates of <span class="annotated ">B. subtilis</span> (Ehrenberg) Cohn were identified.
