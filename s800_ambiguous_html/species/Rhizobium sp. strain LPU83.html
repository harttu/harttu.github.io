<h2>Rhizobium sp. strain LPU83</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEAUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20971905</h3>The nodulation of <span class="unannotated ">alfalfa</span> by the acid-tolerant <span class="match annotated ">Rhizobium sp. strain LPU83</span> does not require sulfated forms of lipochitooligosaccharide nodulation signals. <br><br>The induction of root nodules by the majority of rhizobia has a strict requirement for the secretion of symbiosis-specific lipochitooligosaccharides (nodulation factors [NFs]). The nature of the chemical substitution on the NFs depends on the particular rhizobium and contributes to the host specificity imparted by the NFs. We present here a description of the genetic organization of the nod gene cluster and the characterization of the chemical structure of the NFs associated with the broad-host-range <span class="match annotated ">Rhizobium sp. strain LPU83</span>, a bacterium capable of nodulating at least <span class="annotated ">alfalfa</span>, bean, and <span class="annotated ">Leucena leucocephala</span>. The nod gene cluster was located on the plasmid pLPU83b. The organization of the cluster showed synteny with those of the <span class="annotated ">alfalfa</span>-nodulating rhizobia, <span class="annotated ">Sinorhizobium meliloti</span> and <span class="annotated ">Sinorhizobium medicae</span>. Interestingly, the strongest sequence similarity observed was between the partial nod sequences of <span class="annotated ">Rhizobium mongolense USDA 1844</span> and the corresponding <span class="annotated ">LPU83</span> nod genes sequences. The phylogenetic analysis of the intergenic region nodEG positions strain <span class="annotated ">LPU83</span> and the type strain <span class="annotated ">R. mongolense 1844</span> in the same branch, which indicates that <span class="match annotated ">Rhizobium sp. strain LPU83</span> might represent an early <span class="annotated ">alfalfa</span>-nodulating genotype. The NF chemical structures obtained for the wild-type strain consist of a trimeric, tetrameric, and pentameric chitin backbone that shares some substitutions with both alfalfa- and bean-nodulating rhizobia. Remarkably, while in strain <span class="annotated ">LPU83</span> most of the NFs were sulfated in their reducing terminal residue, none of the NFs isolated from the nodH mutant <span class="annotated ">LPU83-H</span> were sulfated. The evidence obtained supports the notion that the sulfate decoration of NFs in <span class="annotated ">LPU83</span> is not necessary for <span class="annotated ">alfalfa</span> nodulation.
