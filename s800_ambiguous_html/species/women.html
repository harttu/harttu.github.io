<h2>women</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21093904</h3>The health of prisoners.<br><br>More than 10 million <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">people</span> are incarcerated worldwide; this number has increased by about a million in the past decade. Mental disorders and infectious diseases are more common in prisoners than in the general population. High rates of suicide within prison and increased mortality from all causes on release have been documented in many countries. The contribution of prisons to illness is unknown, although shortcomings in treatment and aftercare provision contribute to adverse outcomes. Research has highlighted that <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">women</span>, prisoners aged 55 years and older, and juveniles present with higher rates of many disorders than do other prisoners. The contribution of initiatives to improve the health of prisoners by reducing the burden of infectious and chronic diseases, suicide, other causes of premature mortality and violence, and counteracting the cycle of reoffending should be further examined. 
<h3>21163445</h3>Clinical experience and laboratory investigations in <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. <br><br>Since its discovery in 2007, the encephalitis associated with antibodies against the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) has entered the mainstream of neurology and other disciplines. Most <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> with anti-NMDAR encephalitis develop a multistage illness that progresses from psychosis, memory deficits, seizures, and language disintegration into a state of unresponsiveness with catatonic features often associated with abnormal movements, and autonomic and breathing instability. The disorder predominantly affects <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">children</span> and young adults, occurs with or without tumour association, and responds to treatment but can relapse. The presence of a tumour (usually an ovarian teratoma) is dependent on age, sex, and ethnicity, being more frequent in <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">women</span> older than 18 years, and slightly more predominant in <span class="unannotated ">black</span> <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">women</span> than it is in white <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">women</span>. <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">Patients</span> treated with tumour resection and immunotherapy (corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, or plasma exchange) respond faster to treatment and less frequently need second-line immunotherapy (cyclophosphamide or rituximab, or both) than do <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> without a tumour who receive similar initial immunotherapy. More than 75% of all <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> have substantial recovery that occurs in inverse order of symptom development and is associated with a decline of antibody titres. Patients' antibodies cause a titre-dependent, reversible decrease of synaptic NMDAR by a mechanism of crosslinking and internalisation. On the basis of models of pharmacological or genetic disruption of NMDAR, these antibody effects reveal a probable pathogenic relation between the depletion of receptors and the clinical features of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. 
<h3>21376292</h3>Breast-cancer early detection in low-income and middle-income countries: do what you can versus one size fits all. <br><br>In general, rates of breast cancer are lower in low-income and middle-income countries (LMCs) than they are in more industrialised countries of North America and Europe. This lower incidence means that screening programmes aimed at early detection in asymptomatic <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">women</span> would have a lower yield--ie, substantially more <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">women</span> would need to be examined to find a true case of breast cancer. Because the average age of breast cancer is generally younger in LMCs, it has been suggested that breast-cancer screening programmes begin at an earlier age in these settings. However, the younger average age of breast cancer is mainly driven by the age distribution of the population, and fewer older <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">women</span> with breast cancer, rather than by higher age-specific incidence rates in younger <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">women</span>. Resources in LMCs might be better used to raise awareness and encourage more <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">women</span> with palpable breast lumps to seek and receive treatment in a timely manner. 
<h3>21441069</h3>Preventive therapy for breast cancer: a consensus statement.<br><br>In March, 2010, a group of breast cancer experts met to develop a consensus statement on breast cancer prevention, with a focus on medical and therapeutic interventions. We present the conclusions in this Review. First we agreed that the term chemoprevention is inappropriate and suggested that the term preventive therapy better represents this feature of management. Two selective oestrogen-receptor modulators--tamoxifen and raloxifene--are so far the only medical options approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for preventive therapy. Of these tamoxifen has greater efficacy and can be used in premenopausal <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">women</span>, but raloxifene has fewer side-effects. Two newer drugs in this class, lasofoxifene and arzoxifene, also show efficacy and possibly a better overall risk-benefit profile, but need further assessment. Aromatase inhibitors might be more efficacious, and results of prevention trials are eagerly awaited. Newer agents, notably bisphosphonates and metformin, have shown promise in observational studies and need to be assessed in randomised prevention trials. Other agents, such as aspirin, other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, COX-2 inhibitors, retinoids, rexinoids, and dietary components have limited effects or are in the early phases of investigation. New contralateral tumours in <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">women</span> with breast cancer might be generally useful as a model for prevention, as has been seen for tamoxifen. If valid such a model would facilitate the design of simpler, cheaper, and better-focused trials for assessing new agents. 
<h3>21496907</h3>Stillbirths: the way forward in high-income countries.<br><br>Stillbirth rates in high-income countries declined dramatically from about 1940, but this decline has slowed or stalled over recent times. The present variation in stillbirth rates across and within high-income countries indicates that further reduction in stillbirth is possible. Large disparities (linked to disadvantage such as poverty) in stillbirth rates need to be addressed by providing more educational opportunities and improving living conditions for <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">women</span>. Placental pathologies and infection associated with preterm birth are linked to a substantial proportion of stillbirths. The proportion of unexplained stillbirths associated with under investigation continues to impede efforts in stillbirth prevention. Overweight, obesity, and smoking are important modifiable risk factors for stillbirth, and advanced maternal age is also an increasingly prevalent risk factor. Intensified efforts are needed to ameliorate the effects of these factors on stillbirth rates. Culturally appropriate preconception care and quality antenatal care that is accessible to all <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">women</span> has the potential to reduce stillbirth rates in high-income countries. Implementation of national perinatal mortality audit programmes aimed at improving the quality of care could substantially reduce stillbirths. Better data on numbers and causes of stillbirth are needed, and international consensus on definition and classification related to stillbirth is a priority. All parents should be offered a thorough investigation including a high-quality autopsy and placental histopathology. Parent organisations are powerful change agents and could have an important role in raising awareness to prevent stillbirth. Future research must focus on screening and interventions to reduce antepartum stillbirth as a result of placental dysfunction. Identification of ways to reduce maternal overweight and obesity is a high priority for high-income countries. 
<h3>21463833</h3>Optimisation of breast cancer management in low-resource and middle-resource countries: executive summary of the Breast Health Global Initiative consensus, 2010. <br><br>The purpose of the Breast Health Global Initiative (BHGI) 2010 summit was to provide a consensus analysis of breast cancer control issues and implementation strategies for low-income and middle-income countries (LMCs), where advanced stages at presentation and poor diagnostic and treatment capacities contribute to lower breast cancer survival rates than in high-income countries. Health system and patient-related barriers were identified that create common clinical scenarios in which <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">women</span> do not present for diagnosis until their cancer has progressed to locally advanced or metastatic stages. As countries progress to higher economic status, the rate of late presentation is expected to decrease, and diagnostic and treatment resources are expected to improve. Health-care systems in LMCs share many challenges including national or regional data collection, programme infrastructure and capacity (including appropriate equipment and drug acquisitions, and professional training and accreditation), the need for qualitative and quantitative research to support decision making, and strategies to improve <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patient</span> access and compliance as well as public, health-care professional, and policy-maker awareness that breast cancer is a cost-effective, treatable disease. The biggest challenges identified for low-income countries were little community awareness that breast cancer is treatable, inadequate advanced pathology services for diagnosis and staging, and fragmented treatment options, especially for the administration of radiotherapy and the full range of systemic treatments. The biggest challenges identified for middle-resource countries were the establishment and maintenance of data registries, the coordination of multidisciplinary centres of excellence with broad outreach programmes to provide community access to cancer diagnosis and treatment, and the resource-appropriate prioritisation of breast cancer control programmes within the framework of existing, functional health-care systems.
