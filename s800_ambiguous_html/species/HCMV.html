<h2>HCMV</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20962080</h3>Identification of binary interactions between <span class="annotated ">human cytomegalovirus</span> virion proteins. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Human cytomegalovirus</span> (<span class="match annotated ">HCMV</span>) virions are composed of a DNA-containing nucleocapsid surrounded by a tegument layer and host-derived lipid envelope studded with virally encoded glycoproteins. These complex virions are estimated to be composed of more than 50 <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> proteins. Assembly of <span class="match annotated ">HCMV</span> virions is poorly understood, especially with respect to acquisition of the tegument; however, it is thought to involve the stepwise addition of virion components through protein-protein interactions. We sought to identify interactions among <span class="match annotated ">HCMV</span> virion proteins using <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">yeast</span> two-hybrid analysis. Using 33 known capsid and tegument proteins, we tested 1,089 pairwise combinations for binary interaction in the two-hybrid assay. We identified 24 interactions among <span class="match annotated ">HCMV</span> virion proteins, including 13 novel interactions among tegument proteins and one novel interaction between capsid proteins. Several of these novel interactions were confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of protein complexes from transfected cells. In addition, we demonstrate three of these interactions in the context of <span class="match annotated ">HCMV</span> infection. This study reveals several new protein-protein interactions among <span class="match annotated ">HCMV</span> tegument proteins, some of which are likely important for <span class="match annotated ">HCMV</span> replication and pathogenesis. 
<h3>20980505</h3>Translational control of the abundance of cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein in <span class="annotated ">human cytomegalovirus</span>-infected cells. <br><br>Irrespective of their effects on ongoing host protein synthesis, productive replication of the representative alphaherpesvirus <span class="annotated ">herpes simplex virus type 1</span>, the representative gammaherpesvirus <span class="annotated ">Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus</span>, and the representative betaherpesvirus <span class="annotated ">human cytomegalovirus</span> [<span class="match annotated ">HCMV</span>] stimulates the assembly of the multisubunit, cap-binding translation factor eIF4F. However, only <span class="match annotated ">HCMV</span> replication is associated with an increased abundance of eIF4F core components (eIF4E, eIF4G, eIF4A) and the eIF4F-associated factor poly(A) binding protein (PABP). Here, we demonstrate that the increase in translation factor concentration was readily detected in an asynchronous population of <span class="match annotated ">HCMV</span>-infected primary <span class="annotated ">human</span> fibroblasts, abolished by prior UV inactivation of virus, and genetically dependent upon <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> immediate-early genes. Strikingly, while increased mRNA steady-state levels accompanied the rise in eIF4E and eIF4G protein levels, the overall abundance of PABP mRNA, together with the half-life of the polypeptide it encodes, remained relatively unchanged by <span class="match annotated ">HCMV</span> infection. Instead, <span class="match annotated ">HCMV</span>-induced PABP accumulation resulted from new protein synthesis and was sensitive to the mTORC1-selective inhibitor rapamycin, which interferes with phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrate p70 S6K and the translational repressor 4E-BP1. While virus-induced PABP accumulation did not require p70 S6K, it was inhibited by the expression of a dominant-acting 4E-BP1 variant unable to be inactivated by mTORC1. Finally, unlike the situation in alpha- or gammaherpesvirus-infected cells, where PABP is redistributed to nuclei, PABP accumulated in the cytoplasm of <span class="match annotated ">HCMV</span>-infected cells. Thus, cytoplasmic PABP accumulation is translationally controlled in <span class="match annotated ">HCMV</span>-infected cells via a mechanism requiring mTORC1-mediated inhibition of the cellular 4E-BP1 translational repressor.
