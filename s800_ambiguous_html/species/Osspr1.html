<h2>Osspr1</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEAUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21039568</h3>Identification of a novel mitochondrial protein, short postembryonic roots 1 (SPR1), involved in root development and iron homeostasis in <span class="annotated ">Oryza sativa</span>. <br><br>* <span class="unannotated ">A</span> <span class="annotated ">rice</span> mutant, <span class="annotated ">Oryza sativa short postembryonic roots 1</span> (<span class="match annotated ">Osspr1</span>), has been characterized. It has short postembryonic roots, including adventitious and lateral roots, and a lower iron content in its leaves. * <span class="annotated ">OsSPR1</span> was identified by map-based cloning. It encodes a novel mitochondrial protein with the Armadillo-like repeat domain. * <span class="match unannotated ">Osspr1</span> mutants exhibited decreased root cell elongation. The iron content of the mutant shoots was significantly altered compared with that of wild-type shoots. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> similar pattern of alteration of manganese and zinc concentrations in shoots was also observed. Complementation of the mutant confirmed that <span class="annotated ">OsSPR1</span> is involved in post-embryonic root elongation and iron homeostasis in <span class="unannotated ">rice</span>. <span class="annotated ">OsSPR1</span> was found to be ubiquitously expressed in various tissues throughout the plant. The transcript abundance of various genes involved in iron uptake and signaling via both strategies I and II was similar in roots of wild-type and mutant plants, but was higher in the leaves of mutant plants. * Thus, a novel mitochondrial protein that is involved in root elongation and plays a role in metal ion homeostasis has been identified.
