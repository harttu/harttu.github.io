<h2>GSW-R14</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEAUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20154326</h3><span class="annotated ">Flavobacterium ponti sp. nov.</span>, isolated from seawater.<br><br>A Gram-stain-negative, non-flagellated, non-gliding, yellow-pigmented and rod-shaped bacterial strain, designated <span class="match annotated ">GSW-R14</span>(T), was isolated from seawater of Geoje Island in the South Sea, Korea. Strain <span class="match annotated ">GSW-R14</span>(T) grew optimally at 25 ^0C, at pH 7.0-8.0 and in the presence of 2 % (w/v) NaCl. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain <span class="match annotated ">GSW-R14</span>(T) belonged to the genus Flavobacterium, joining <span class="annotated ">Flavobacterium gelidilacus</span> LMG 21477(T) by a bootstrap resampling value of 100 %. Strain <span class="match annotated ">GSW-R14</span>(T) exhibited 97.6 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to <span class="annotated ">F. gelidilacus</span> LMG 21477(T) and similarities of 91.2-95.2 % to other members of the genus Flavobacterium. Strain <span class="match annotated ">GSW-R14</span>(T) contained MK-6 as the predominant menaquinone. The fatty acid profile of strain <span class="match annotated ">GSW-R14</span>(T) was similar to that of <span class="annotated ">F. gelidilacus</span> LMG 21477(T). The DNA G+C content of strain <span class="match annotated ">GSW-R14</span>(T) was 31.4 mol% and its DNA-DNA relatedness with <span class="annotated ">F. gelidilacus</span> LMG 21477(T) was 31 %. Strain <span class="match annotated ">GSW-R14</span>(T) could be distinguished from <span class="annotated ">F. gelidilacus</span> and the other species of the genus Flavobacterium by its phylogenetic and genetic distinctiveness and by several phenotypic properties. On the basis of these data, strain <span class="match annotated ">GSW-R14</span>(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Flavobacterium, for which the name <span class="annotated ">Flavobacterium ponti sp. nov.</span> is proposed; the type strain is <span class="match annotated ">GSW-R14</span>(T) (=KCTC 22802(T) =CCUG 58402(T)).
