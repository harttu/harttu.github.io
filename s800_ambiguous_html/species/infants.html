<h2>infants</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20962092</h3>Induction of type I interferon secretion through recombinant <span class="annotated ">Newcastle disease virus</span> expressing <span class="annotated ">measles virus</span> hemagglutinin stimulates antibody secretion in the presence of maternal antibodies. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Measles virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">MV</span>) vaccine effectively protects seronegative individuals against infection. However, inhibition of vaccine-induced seroconversion by maternal antibodies after vaccination remains a problem, as it leaves <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">infants</span> susceptible to <span class="annotated ">MV</span> infection. In <span class="unannotated ">cotton</span> <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">rats</span>, passive transfer of <span class="annotated ">MV</span>-specific IgG mimics maternal antibodies and inhibits vaccine-induced seroconversion. Here, we report that immunization in the presence of passively transferred IgG inhibits the secretion of neutralizing antibodies but not the generation of <span class="annotated ">MV</span>-specific B cells. This finding suggested that <span class="annotated ">MV</span>-specific B cells require an additional stimulus to mature into antibody-secreting plasma cells. In order to provide such a stimulus, we generated a recombinant <span class="annotated ">Newcastle disease virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">NDV</span>) expressing the <span class="annotated ">MV</span> hemagglutinin (<span class="annotated ">NDV-H</span>). In contrast to <span class="annotated ">MV</span>, <span class="annotated ">NDV-H</span> induced high levels of type I interferon in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and in lung tissue. In <span class="unannotated ">cotton</span> <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">rats</span> immunized with <span class="annotated ">NDV-H</span>, neutralizing antibodies were also generated in the presence of passively transferred antibodies. In the latter case, however, the level and kinetics of antibody generation were reduced. In vitro, alpha interferon stimulated the activation of <span class="annotated ">MV</span>-specific B cells from <span class="annotated ">MV</span>-immune spleen cells. <span class="annotated ">NDV</span> infection (which induces alpha interferon) had the same effect, and stimulation could be abrogated by antibodies neutralizing alpha interferon, but not interleukin 6 (IL-6). In vivo, coapplication of UV-inactivated <span class="annotated ">MV</span> with <span class="annotated ">NDV</span> led to increased <span class="annotated ">MV</span>-specific antibody production in the presence and absence of passively transferred antibodies. These data indicate that <span class="annotated ">MV</span>-specific B cells are being generated after immunization in the presence of maternal antibodies and that the provision of alpha interferon as an additional signal leads to antibody secretion. 
<h3>20980510</h3>Assembly and immunological properties of <span class="annotated ">Newcastle disease virus</span>-like particles containing the <span class="annotated ">respiratory syncytial virus</span> F and G proteins. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Human respiratory syncytial virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">RSV</span>) is a serious respiratory pathogen in <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">infants</span> and young <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">children</span> as well as elderly and immunocompromised populations. However, no <span class="annotated ">RSV</span> vaccines are available. We have explored the potential of virus-like particles (VLPs) as an <span class="annotated ">RSV</span> vaccine candidate. VLPs composed entirely of <span class="annotated ">RSV</span> proteins were produced at levels inadequate for their preparation as immunogens. However, VLPs composed of the <span class="annotated ">Newcastle disease virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">NDV</span>) nucleocapsid and membrane proteins and chimera proteins containing the ectodomains of <span class="annotated ">RSV</span> F and G proteins fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of <span class="annotated ">NDV</span> F and HN proteins, respectively, were quantitatively prepared from avian cells. Immunization of <span class="annotated ">mice</span> with these VLPs, without adjuvant, stimulated robust, anti-<span class="annotated ">RSV</span> F and G protein antibody responses. IgG2a/IgG1 ratios were very high, suggesting predominantly T(H)1 responses. In contrast to infectious <span class="annotated ">RSV</span> immunization, neutralization antibody titers were robust and stable for 4 months. Immunization with a single dose of VLPs resulted in the complete protection of <span class="annotated ">mice</span> from <span class="annotated ">RSV</span> replication in lungs. Upon <span class="annotated ">RSV</span> intranasal challenge of VLP-immunized <span class="annotated ">mice</span>, no enhanced lung pathology was observed, in contrast to the pathology observed in <span class="annotated ">mice</span> immunized with formalin-inactivated <span class="annotated ">RSV</span>. These results suggest that these VLPs are effective <span class="annotated ">RSV</span> vaccines in <span class="annotated ">mice</span>, in contrast to other nonreplicating <span class="annotated ">RSV</span> vaccine candidates. 
<h3>21435600</h3>Treatment advances in neonatal neuroprotection and neurointensive care.<br><br>Knowledge of the nature, prognosis, and ways to treat brain lesions in neonatal <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">infants</span> has increased remarkably. Neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) in term <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">infants</span>, mirrors a progressive cascade of excito-oxidative events that unfold in the brain after an asphyxial insult. In the laboratory, this cascade can be blocked to protect brain tissue through the process of neuroprotection. However, proof of a clinical effect was lacking until the publication of three positive randomised controlled trials of moderate hypothermia for term <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">infants</span> with HIE. These results have greatly improved treatment prospects for babies with asphyxia and altered understanding of the theory of neuroprotection. The studies show that moderate hypothermia within 6 h of asphyxia improves survival without cerebral palsy or other disability by about 40% and reduces death or neurological disability by nearly 30%. The search is on to discover adjuvant treatments that can further enhance the effects of hypothermia.
