<h2>pigs</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20923690</h3>Development of a blocking ELISA for detection of serum neutralizing antibodies against <span class="annotated ">porcine circovirus type 2</span>. <br><br>A monoclonal antibody (Mab)-based blocking ELISA was developed for the detection of serum neutralizing antibodies to <span class="annotated ">porcine circovirus type 2</span> (<span class="annotated ">PCV2</span>). The Mab with neutralizing activity, which was produced by immunizing a recombinant capsid protein of <span class="annotated ">PCV2</span> expressed in insect cells, was used as the detector antibody. The assay was evaluated in comparison with a serum neutralization assay, and its sensitivity and specificity were determined to be 98.8% and 88.5%, respectively. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> significant positive correlation was found between results of the blocking ELISA and the serum neutralization assay (r=0.9381). The assay was verified by testing experimental and commercial <span class="annotated ">pig</span> sera. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> longitudinal antibody profile showed that serum neutralizing antibodies were detected 2 weeks after vaccination and that the detection rate reached 100% at 4 weeks. The serum neutralizing antibody profile showed a decrease from the age of 4 to 13 weeks, and seroconversion after 13 weeks in <span class="match annotated ">pigs</span> from a commercial <span class="annotated ">pig</span> farm. Additionally, the positive detection rate in 703 sera collected from nine commercial <span class="annotated ">pig</span> farms was 73%. This report demonstrates that the assay is a simple, specific, sensitive and convenient method for epidemiological surveys and evaluations of serum neutralizing antibodies against <span class="annotated ">PCV2</span>. 
<h3>20962084</h3>Modifications in the polymerase genes of a swine-like triple-reassortant <span class="unannotated ">influenza virus</span> to generate live attenuated vaccines against 2009 pandemic <span class="annotated ">H1N1 viruses</span>. <br><br>On 11 June 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the outbreaks caused by novel <span class="annotated ">swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus</span> had reached pandemic proportions. The pandemic <span class="annotated ">H1N1 (H1N1pdm) virus</span> is the predominant <span class="unannotated ">influenza virus</span> strain in the <span class="annotated ">human</span> population. It has also crossed the species barriers and infected <span class="annotated ">turkeys</span> and <span class="annotated ">swine</span> in several countries. Thus, the development of a vaccine that is effective in multiple animal species is urgently needed. We have previously demonstrated that the introduction of temperature-sensitive mutations into the PB2 and PB1 genes of an avian <span class="annotated ">H9N2 virus</span>, combined with the insertion of a hemagglutinin (HA) tag in PB1, resulted in an attenuated (att) vaccine backbone for both <span class="annotated ">chickens</span> and <span class="annotated ">mice</span>. Because the new pandemic strain is a triple-reassortant (TR) virus, we chose to introduce the double attenuating modifications into a <span class="annotated ">swine</span>-like TR virus isolate, <span class="annotated ">A/turkey/OH/313053/04 (H3N2)</span> (ty/04), with the goal of producing live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV). This genetically modified backbone had impaired polymerase activity and restricted virus growth at elevated temperatures. In vivo characterization of two <span class="annotated ">H1N1</span> vaccine candidates generated using the ty/04 att backbone demonstrated that this vaccine is highly attenuated in <span class="annotated ">mice</span>, as indicated by the absence of signs of disease, limited replication, and minimum histopathological alterations in the respiratory tract. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> single immunization with the ty/04 att-based vaccines conferred complete protection against a lethal <span class="annotated ">H1N1pdm virus</span> infection in <span class="annotated ">mice</span>. More importantly, vaccination of <span class="match annotated ">pigs</span> with a ty/04 att-<span class="annotated ">H1N1</span> vaccine candidate resulted in sterilizing immunity upon an aggressive intratracheal challenge with the 2009 <span class="annotated ">H1N1</span> pandemic virus. Our studies highlight the safety of the ty/04 att vaccine platform and its potential as a master donor strain for the generation of live attenuated vaccines for <span class="annotated ">humans</span> and livestock. 
<h3>20933542</h3>The rapid production of high-titer <span class="annotated ">porcine endogenous retrovirus(PERV)-B</span> env pseudotype and construction of an EGFP-expressing replication competent <span class="unannotated ">PERV-A</span> vector. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Porcine endogenous retroviruses</span> (<span class="annotated ">PERVs</span>) present a unique concern associated with xenotransplantation because they have been shown to infect certain <span class="annotated ">human</span> cells in vitro and it is also difficult to generate herds of <span class="match annotated ">pigs</span> free of <span class="annotated ">PERVs</span>. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> simple system for the production of high-titer MoMLV-PERV pseudotypes is reported; an EGFP-expressing replication-competent molecular clone that allows direct measurement of titer was also constructed. To improve the MLV-based <span class="annotated ">retroviral</span> vector system, a 2.1-kb <span class="annotated ">PERV-B</span> env product was amplified from PK-15 genomic DNA and cloned into the pCL-Eco <span class="unannotated ">retroviral</span> vector. The titer of lacZ (<span class="annotated ">PERV-B</span>) from the 293 cells was about 1.0x10(4) CFU/ml. In contrast, the titer of lacZ (<span class="annotated ">PERV-B</span>) from a conventional <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">murine</span> <span class="annotated ">retroviral</span> vector (split genome) was found to be 1.2x10(2) CFU/ml when the <span class="annotated ">PERV-B</span> env expression vector was transfected into TELCeB6 cells, which harbor MFGnlslacZ and the gag-pol-expressing vector. In addition, an infectious <span class="annotated ">PERV-A</span> clone containing enhanced GFP (EGFP) by using a PCR-based method was developed. This EGFP-expressing PERV-A-IRES-EGFP molecular clone was found to be stable genetically on transfection in 293 cells.
