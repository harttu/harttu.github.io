<h2>seasonal influenza A/H1N1</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21029748</h3>One-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR assays for detecting and subtyping <span class="annotated ">pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009</span>, <span class="match annotated ">seasonal influenza A/H1N1</span>, and <span class="annotated ">seasonal influenza A/H3N2 viruses</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 (A/H1N1pdm) virus</span> has caused significant outbreaks worldwide. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> previous one-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) assay for detecting <span class="annotated ">A/H1N1pdm virus</span> (H1pdm rRT-PCR assay) was improved since the former probe had a low melting temperature and low tolerance to <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> mutation. To help with the screening of the <span class="annotated ">A/H1N1pdm virus</span>, rRT-PCR assays were also developed for detecting <span class="annotated ">human</span> <span class="annotated ">seasonal A/H1N1</span> (H1 rRT-PCR assay) and <span class="annotated ">A/H3N2 influenza viruses</span> (H3 rRT-PCR assay). H1pdm, <span class="unannotated ">H1</span>, and H3 rRT-PCR assays were evaluated using in vitro-transcribed control RNA, isolated viruses, and other respiratory pathogenic viruses, and were shown to have high sensitivity, good linearity (R(2)=0.99), and high specificity. In addition, the improved H1pdm rRT-PCR assay could detect two <span class="annotated ">viral strains of A/H1N1pdm</span>, namely, <span class="annotated ">A/Aichi/472/2009 (H1N1)pdm</span> and <span class="annotated ">A/Sakai/89/2009 (H1N1)pdm</span>, which have mutation(s) in the probe-binding region of the hemagglutinin gene, without loss of sensitivity. Using the three rRT-PCR assays developed, 90 clinical specimens collected between May and October 2009 were then tested. Of these, 26, 20, and 2 samples were identified as positive for <span class="annotated ">A/H1pdm</span>, <span class="annotated ">A/H3</span>, and <span class="annotated ">A/H1</span>, respectively, while 42 samples were negative for <span class="annotated ">influenza A viruses</span>. The present results suggest that these highly sensitive and specific H1pdm, <span class="unannotated ">H1</span>, and H3 rRT-PCR assays are useful not only for diagnosing <span class="annotated ">influenza viruses</span>, but also for the surveillance of <span class="annotated ">influenza viruses</span>.
