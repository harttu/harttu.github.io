<h2>Arabidopsis thaliana</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20840499</h3>Functional characterization of <span class="match annotated ">Arabidopsis thaliana</span> isopropylmalate dehydrogenases reveals their important roles in gametophyte development. <br><br>* Isopropylmalate dehydrogenases (IPMDHs) catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of 3-isopropylmalate (3-IPM) in leucine biosynthesis in microorganisms. The <span class="match annotated ">Arabidopsis thaliana</span> genome contains three putative IPMDH genes. * IPMDH2 and IPMDH3 proteins exhibited significantly higher activity toward 3-IPM than IPMDH1, which is indicative of a pivotal role in leucine biosynthesis. Single mutants of IPMDH2 or IPMDH3 lacked a discernible phenotype. Genetic analysis showed that ipmdh2 ipmdh3 was lethal in male gametophytes and had reduced transmission through female gametophytes. The aborted pollen grains were small, abnormal in cellular structure, and arrested in germination. In addition, half of the double mutant embryo sacs exhibited slowed development. * The IPMDH2/ipmdh2 ipmdh3/ipmdh3 genotype exhibited abnormal vegetative phenotypes, suggesting haplo-insufficiency of IPMDH2 in the ipmdh3 background. This mutant and a triple mutant containing one allele of IPMDH2 or IPMDH3 had decreased leucine biosynthetic enzyme activities and lower free leucine concentrations. The latter mutant showed changes in glucosinolate profiles different from those in the ipmdh1 mutant. * The results demonstrate that IPMDH2 and IPMDH3 primarily function in leucine biosynthesis, are essential for pollen development and are needed for proper embryo sac development. 
<h3>20880224</h3><span class="match annotated ">Arabidopsis thaliana</span> populations show clinal variation in a climatic gradient associated with altitude. <br><br>* Understanding the adaptive basis of life history variation is a central goal in evolutionary ecology. The use of model species enables the combination of molecular mechanistic knowledge with ecological and evolutionary questions, but the study of life history variation in natural environments is required to merge these disciplines. * Here, we tested for clinal variation in life history and associated traits along an environmental and altitudinal gradient in the model species <span class="match annotated ">Arabidopsis thaliana</span>. Seventeen natural populations of <span class="annotated ">A. thaliana</span> were geo-referenced in north-eastern Spain on a gradient in which precipitation increases but maximum spring temperature and minimum winter temperature decrease with altitude. * One hundred and eighty-nine genotypes from the 17 populations were grown under uniform controlled conditions. Variations in traits related to biomass allocation, fecundity, phenology and vegetative growth were tested for relationships with the altitude and climatic variables associated with the home sites. Above-ground mass, number of rosette leaves at bolting, developmental time and seed weight increased with the home site's altitude. Root allocation, vegetative growth during winter and number of seeds decreased with altitude. * We suggest that the differences among home sites provide clues to the variation in adaptive strategies associated with the climatic gradient. We compared these results with adaptations and clinal relationships reported for other species and with molecular mechanisms described in <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">Arabidopsis</span>. 
<h3>21039566</h3>Nitric oxide participates in cold-responsive phosphosphingolipid formation and gene expression in <span class="match annotated ">Arabidopsis thaliana</span>. <br><br>Chilling triggers rapid molecular responses that permit the maintenance of plant cell homeostasis and plant adaptation. Recent data showed that nitric oxide (NO) is involved in plant acclimation and tolerance to cold. The participation of NO in the early transduction of the cold signal in <span class="match annotated ">Arabidopsis thaliana</span> was investigated. The production of NO after a short exposure to cold was assessed using the NO-sensitive fluorescent probe 4, 5-diamino fluoresceine diacetate and chemiluminescence. Pharmacological and genetic approaches were used to analyze NO sources and NO-mediated changes in cold-regulated gene expression, phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) synthesis and sphingolipid phosphorylation. NO production was detected after 1-4h of chilling. It was impaired in the nia1nia2 nitrate reductase mutant. Moreover, NO accumulation was not observed in H7 plants overexpressing the <span class="annotated ">A. thaliana</span> nonsymbiotic hemoglobin <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">Arabidopsis</span> haemoglobin 1 (AHb1). Cold-regulated gene expression was affected in nia1nia2 and H7 plants. The synthesis of PtdOH upon chilling was not modified by NO depletion. By contrast, the formation of phytosphingosine phosphate and ceramide phosphate, two phosphorylated sphingolipids that are transiently synthesized upon chilling, was negatively regulated by NO. Taken together, these data suggest a new function for NO as an intermediate in gene regulation and lipid-based signaling during cold transduction. 
<h3>21054410</h3>Possible contributions of TERMINAL FLOWER 1 to the evolution of rosette flowering in Leavenworthia (Brassicaceae). <br><br><span class="annotated ">Leavenworthia crassa</span> is a rosette flowering species that differs from inflorescence flowering species, such as <span class="match annotated ">Arabidopsis thaliana</span>, in having elongated pedicels and shortened interfloral internodes on the main axis. Based on previous experiments, we hypothesized that changes to the <span class="annotated ">L. crassa</span> TFL1 ortholog, LcrTFL1, were important in the evolution of rosette flowering. We isolated LcrTFL1 and introduced a genomic construct into tfl1 mutant <span class="annotated ">A. thaliana</span> plants. We also generated and analyzed EGFP-LcrTFL1 reporter-fusion lines, and LcrTFL1/LcrLFY doubly transgenic lines. The transgene rescued the mutant defects, but manifested gain-of-function phenotypes. However, LcrTFL1 lines differed from 35S:TFL1 lines in several regards. Defects in floral meristem identity establishment were observed, as was the production of flowers with extra petals. We also noted features that resemble rosette flowering: LcrTFL1 lines produced significantly shorter interfloral internodes and significantly longer pedicels than either wild-type or 35S:TFL1 plants. Our data show that there are substantive differences in the regulation and/or function of TFL1 orthologs between <span class="annotated ">A. thaliana</span> and <span class="annotated ">L. crassa</span>. These may reflect changes that occurred during the evolution of rosette flowering in Leavenworthia, but, if so, our results show that additional, as-yet-unidentified genes were involved in this instance of architectural evolution. 
<h3>21241326</h3>Gene expression analysis of wounding-induced root-to-shoot communication in <span class="match annotated ">Arabidopsis thaliana</span>. <br><br>Root-to-shoot communication plays an important role in the adaptation to environmental stress. In this study, we established a model system for root-to-shoot signalling to observe global gene expression in <span class="match annotated ">Arabidopsis thaliana</span>. The roots of <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">Arabidopsis</span> seedlings were wounded and the expression in the shoots of 68 and 5 genes was up-regulated threefold at 30 min and 6 h post-injury, respectively. These genes were designated early and late Root-to-Shoot responsive (RtS) genes, respectively. Many of the early RtS genes were found to encode transcription factors such as AtERFs, whereas others were associated with jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET). Some of the late RtS genes were shown to be regulated by 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA). In fact, elevated levels of JA and OPDA were detected in the shoots of seedlings 30 min and 6 h, respectively, after wounding of the roots. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> mutant analysis revealed that JA and ET are involved in the expression of the early RtS genes. Thus, root-to-shoot communication for many RtS genes is associated with the systemic production of JA, OPDA and possibly ET. 
<h3>20955226</h3>Separating parental environment from seed size effects on next generation growth and development in <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">Arabidopsis</span>. <br><br>Plant growth and development is profoundly influenced by environmental conditions that laboratory experimentation typically attempts to control. However, growth conditions are not uniform between or even within laboratories and the extent to which these differences influence plant growth and development is unknown. Experiments with wild-type <span class="match annotated ">Arabidopsis thaliana</span> were designed to quantify the influences of parental environment and seed size on growth and development in the next generation. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> single lot of seed was planted in six environmental chambers and grown to maturity. The seed produced was mechanically sieved into small and large size classes then grown in a common environment and subjected to a set of assays spanning the life cycle. Analysis of variance demonstrated that seed size effects were particularly significant early in development, affecting primary root growth and gravitropism, but also flowering time. Parental environment affected progeny germination time, flowering and weight of seed the progeny produced. In some cases, the parental environment affected the magnitude of (interacted with) the observed seed size effects. These data indicate that life history circumstances of the parental generation can affect growth and development throughout the life cycle of the next generation to an extent that should be considered when performing genetic studies.
