<h2>cyanobacterial</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20190018</h3>An rpoB signature sequence provides unique resolution for the molecular typing of cyanobacteria. <br><br>The use of morphological characters for the classification of cyanobacteria has often led to ambiguous strain assignment. In the past two decades, the availability of sequences, such as those of the 16S rRNA, nif, cpc and rpoC1 genes, and the use of metagenomics, has steadily increased and has made the reconstruction of evolutionary relationships of some <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">cyanobacterial</span> groups possible in addition to improving strain assignment. Conserved indels (insertions/deletions) are present in all <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">cyanobacterial</span> RpoB (Beta subunit of RNA polymerase) sequences presently available in public databases. These indels are located in the Rpb2_6 domain of RpoB, which is involved in DNA binding and DNA-directed RNA polymerase activity. They are variable in length (6-44 aa) and sequence, and form part of what appears to be a longer signature sequence (43-81 aa). Indeed, a number of these sequences turn out to be distinctive among several strains of a given genus and even among strains of a given species. These signature sequences can thus be used to identify cyanobacteria at a subgenus level and can be useful molecular markers to establish the taxonomic positions of <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">cyanobacterial</span> isolates in laboratory cultures, and/or to assess <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">cyanobacterial</span> biodiversity in space and time in natural ecosystems. 
<h3>20934378</h3>Cyanobacterial endosymbionts in the benthic dinoflagellate <span class="annotated ">Sinophysis canaliculata</span> (Dinophysiales, Dinophyceae). <br><br>Photosynthetic dinoflagellates possess a great diversity of plastids that have been acquired through successful serial endosymbiosis. The peridinin-containing plastid in dinoflagellates is canonical, but many other types are known within this group. Within the Dinophysiales, several species of Dinophysis contain plastids, derived from cryptophytes or haptophytes. In this work, the presence of numerous intracellular cyanobacteria-like microorganisms compartmentalized by a separate membrane is reported for the first time within the benthic dinophysoid dinoflagellate <span class="annotated ">Sinophysis canaliculata</span> Quod et al., a species from a genus morphologically close to Dinophysis. Although the contribution of these <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">cyanobacterial</span> endosymbionts to <span class="annotated ">S. canaliculata</span> is still unknown, this finding suggests a possible undergoing primary endosymbiosis in a dinoflagellate. 
<h3>21036997</h3>Distinct roles of multiple NDH-1 complexes in the <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">cyanobacterial</span> electron transport network as revealed by kinetic analysis of P700+ reduction in various Ndh-deficient mutants of <span class="annotated ">Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803</span>. <br><br>While methyl viologen had only a small effect on P700(+) rereduction kinetics after far-red pulses in KCN-treated wild-type <span class="annotated ">Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803</span> and an NdhF3/NdhF4 (NdhF3/F4)-defective mutant, it involved a rather slow P700(+) rereduction in an NdhF1-defective mutant. This strongly indicates that (i) active electron flow from metabolites to plastoquinone is suppressed upon deletion of ndhF1 and (ii) photosystem 1-mediated cyclic electron transport is dependent on NdhF3/F4-type NDH-1 complexes. 
<h3>22056522</h3>A heme peroxidase of the ascomyceteous lichen <span class="annotated ">Leptogium saturninum</span> oxidizes high-redox potential substrates. <br><br>Lichens belonging to the order Peltigerales display strong activity of multi-copper oxidases (e.g. tyrosinase) as well as heme-containing peroxidases. The lichen peroxidase was purified to homogeneity from the thallus of <span class="annotated ">Leptogium saturninum</span> (LsaPOX) by fast protein liquid chromatography and then partially characterized. The oligomeric protein occurs as both 79kDa dimeric and 42kDa monomeric forms, and displayed broad substrate specificity. In addition to an ability to oxidize classic peroxidase substrates (e.g. 2,6-dimethoxyphenol), the enzyme could convert recalcitrant compounds such as synthetic dyes (e.g. Azure B and Reactive Blue 5), 4-nitrophenol and non-phenolic methoxylated aromatics (e.g. veratryl alcohol). Comparing LsaPOX with a basidiomycete dye-decolorizing (DyP)-type peroxidase from <span class="annotated ">Auricularia auricula-judae</span> showed that the lichen enzyme has a high-redox potential, with oxidation capabilities ranging between those of known plant and fungal peroxidases. Internal peptide fragments show homology (up to 60%) with putative proteins from free-living ascomycetes (e.g. <span class="annotated ">Penicillium marneffei</span> and <span class="annotated ">Neosartorya fischeri</span>), but not to sequences of algal or <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">cyanobacterial</span> peptides or to known fungal, bacterial or plant peroxidases. LsaPOX is the first heme peroxidase purified from an ascomyceteous lichen that may help the organism to successfully exploit the extreme micro-environments in which they often grow.
