<h2>Candida glabrata</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEAUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21145409</h3>Overexpression of the trichodiene synthase gene tri5 increases trichodermin production and antimicrobial activity in <span class="annotated ">Trichoderma brevicompactum</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Trichoderma brevicompactum</span> produces trichodermin, a simple trichothecene-type toxin that shares the first steps of the sesquiterpene biosynthetic pathway with other phytotoxic trichothecenes from <span class="annotated ">Fusarium spp</span>. Trichodiene synthase catalyses the conversion of farnesyl pyrophosphate to trichodiene and it is encoded by the tri5 gene that was cloned and analysed functionally by homologous overexpression in <span class="annotated ">T. brevicompactum</span>. tri5 expression was up-regulated in media with glucose, H(2)O(2) or glycerol. tri5 repression was observed in cultures supplemented with the antioxidants ferulic acid and tyrosol. Acetone extracts of tri5-overexpressing transformants displayed higher antifungal activity than those from the wild-type. Chromatographic and spectroscopic analyses revealed that tri5 overexpression led to an increased production of trichodermin and tyrosol. Agar diffusion assays with these two purified metabolites from the tri5-overexpressing transformant <span class="annotated ">T. brevicompactum</span> Tb41tri5 showed that only trichodermin had antifungal activity against <span class="annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, <span class="annotated ">Kluyveromyces marxianus</span>, <span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span>, <span class="match annotated ">Candida glabrata</span>, <span class="annotated ">Candida tropicalis</span> and <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus fumigatus</span>, in most cases such activity being higher than that observed for amphotericin B and hygromycin. Our results point to the significant role of tri5 in the production of trichodermin and in the antifungal activity of <span class="annotated ">T. brevicompactum</span>. 
<h3>21272794</h3>Emerging opportunistic <span class="unannotated ">yeast</span> infections.<br><br>A growing population of immunosuppressed <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span> has resulted in increasingly frequent diagnoses of invasive <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> infections, including those caused by unusual <span class="unannotated ">yeasts</span>. The incidence of non-albicans species of Candida is increasing compared with that of <span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span>, and several species, such as <span class="match annotated ">Candida glabrata</span> and <span class="annotated ">Candida krusei</span>, may be resistant to azole antifungal therapy. Trichosporon species are the second most common cause of fungaemia in <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span> with haematological malignant disease and are characterised by resistance to amphotericin and echinocandins and poor prognosis. Rhodotorula species belong to the family Cryptococcaceae, and are a cause of catheter-related fungaemia, sepsis, and invasive disease in severely immunosuppressed <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span>. An increasing number of sporadic cases of invasive <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> infections by non-neoformans cryptococci have been reported in immunocompromised hosts, especially for <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span> with advanced <span class="annotated ">HIV</span> infection or cancer who are undergoing transplant. Other uncommon <span class="unannotated ">yeasts</span> that can cause invasive disease in severely immunosuppressed <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span> include Geotrichum, Hansenula, Malassezia, and Saccharomyces. Host immune status is a crucial determinant of the type of invasive <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> infection a <span class="linneaus_only ">patient</span> is at risk for. Diagnosis can be challenging and relies heavily on traditional cultures of blood and other sterile sites, although serum (1,3)-Beta-D-glucan testing might have an adjunctive role. Although rare <span class="unannotated ">yeasts</span> are emerging as opportunistic <span class="annotated ">human</span> pathogens, diagnosis remains challenging and treatment suboptimal.
