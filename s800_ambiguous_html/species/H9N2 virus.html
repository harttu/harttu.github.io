<h2>H9N2 virus</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEAUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20962084</h3>Modifications in the polymerase genes of a <span class="annotated ">swine</span>-like triple-reassortant <span class="annotated ">influenza virus</span> to generate live attenuated vaccines against 2009 pandemic <span class="annotated ">H1N1 viruses</span>. <br><br>On 11 June 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the outbreaks caused by novel <span class="annotated ">swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus</span> had reached pandemic proportions. The pandemic <span class="unannotated ">H1N1</span> (H1N1pdm) <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> is the predominant <span class="annotated ">influenza virus</span> strain in the <span class="annotated ">human</span> population. It has also crossed the species barriers and infected turkeys and <span class="annotated ">swine</span> in several countries. Thus, the development of a vaccine that is effective in multiple animal species is urgently needed. We have previously demonstrated that the introduction of temperature-sensitive mutations into the PB2 and PB1 genes of an avian <span class="match annotated ">H9N2 virus</span>, combined with the insertion of a hemagglutinin (HA) tag in PB1, resulted in an attenuated (att) vaccine backbone for both <span class="annotated ">chickens</span> and <span class="unannotated ">mice</span>. Because the new pandemic strain is a triple-reassortant (TR) <span class="unannotated ">virus</span>, we chose to introduce the double attenuating modifications into a <span class="annotated ">swine</span>-like TR <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> isolate, <span class="annotated ">A/turkey/OH/313053/04 (H3N2)</span> (ty/04), with the goal of producing live attenuated <span class="unannotated ">influenza</span> vaccines (LAIV). This genetically modified backbone had impaired polymerase activity and restricted <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> growth at elevated temperatures. In vivo characterization of two <span class="annotated ">H1N1</span> vaccine candidates generated using the ty/04 att backbone demonstrated that this vaccine is highly attenuated in <span class="unannotated ">mice</span>, as indicated by the absence of signs of disease, limited replication, and minimum histopathological alterations in the respiratory tract. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> single immunization with the ty/04 att-based vaccines conferred complete protection against a lethal <span class="unannotated ">H1N1pdm</span> <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> infection in <span class="unannotated ">mice</span>. More importantly, vaccination of <span class="unannotated ">pigs</span> with a ty/04 att-H1N1 vaccine candidate resulted in sterilizing immunity upon an aggressive intratracheal challenge with the 2009 <span class="unannotated ">H1N1</span> pandemic <span class="unannotated ">virus</span>. Our studies highlight the safety of the ty/04 att vaccine platform and its potential as a master donor strain for the generation of live attenuated vaccines for <span class="annotated ">humans</span> and livestock.
