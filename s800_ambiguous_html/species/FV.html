<h2>FV</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20980520</h3>Persistent <span class="annotated ">Friend virus</span> replication and disease in Apobec3-deficient <span class="annotated ">mice</span> expressing functional B-cell-activating factor receptor. <br><br>Rfv3 is an autosomal dominant gene that influences the recovery of resistant <span class="annotated ">mice</span> from <span class="annotated ">Friend retrovirus</span> (<span class="match annotated ">FV</span>) infection by limiting viremia and promoting a more potent neutralizing antibody response. We previously reported that Rfv3 is encoded by Apobec3, an innate retrovirus restriction factor. However, it was recently suggested that the Rfv3 susceptible phenotype of high viremia at 28 days postinfection (dpi) was more dominantly controlled by the B-cell-activating factor receptor (BAFF-R), a gene that is linked to but located outside the genetically mapped region containing Rfv3. Although one prototypical Rfv3 susceptible <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> strain, A/WySn, indeed contains a dysfunctional BAFF-R, two other Rfv3 susceptible strains, BALB/c and <span class="unannotated ">A</span>.BY, express functional BAFF-R genes, determined on the basis of genotyping and B-cell immunophenotyping. Furthermore, transcomplementation studies in (C57BL/6 [B6] x BALB/c)F(1) and (B6 x <span class="unannotated ">A</span>.BY)F(1) <span class="annotated ">mice</span> revealed that the B6 Apobec3 gene significantly influences recovery from <span class="match annotated ">FV</span> viremia, cellular infection, and disease at 28 dpi. Finally, the Rfv3 phenotypes of prototypic B6, <span class="unannotated ">A</span>.BY, A/WySn, and BALB/c <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> strains correlate with reported Apobec3 mRNA expression levels. Overall, these findings argue against the generality of BAFF-R polymorphisms as a dominant mechanism to explain the Rfv3 recovery phenotype and further strengthen the evidence that Apobec3 encodes Rfv3. 
<h3>21047954</h3>Complement opsonization enhances <span class="annotated ">friend virus</span> infection of B cells and thereby amplifies the virus-specific CD8+ T cell response. <br><br>B cells are one of the targets of <span class="annotated ">Friend virus</span> (<span class="match annotated ">FV</span>) infection, a well-established <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> model often used to study <span class="annotated ">retroviral</span> infections in vivo. Although B cells may be effective in stimulating cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, studies involving their role in <span class="match annotated ">FV</span> infection have mainly focused on neutralizing antibody production. Here we show that polyclonal activation of B cells promotes their infection with <span class="match annotated ">FV</span> both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that complement opsonization of Friend <span class="annotated ">murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV)</span> enhances infection of B cells, which correlates with increased potency of B cells to activate FV-specific CD8(+) T cells.
