<h2>Bacillus thuringiensis</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEAUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21815956</h3>Insertion of an intact CR1 retrotransposon in a cadherin gene linked with <span class="unannotated ">Bt</span> resistance in the <span class="annotated ">pink bollworm</span>, <span class="annotated ">Pectinophora gossypiella</span>. <br><br>Three mutations in the <span class="annotated ">Pectinophora gossypiella</span> cadherin gene PgCad1 are linked with resistance to <span class="match annotated ">Bacillus thuringiensis</span> (<span class="annotated ">Bt</span>) toxin Cry1Ac. Here we show that the r3 mutation entails recent insertion into PgCad1 of an active <span class="annotated ">chicken</span> repeat (CR1) retrotransposon, designated CR1-1_Pg. Unlike most other CR1 elements, CR1-1_Pg is intact, transcribed by a flanking promoter, contains target site duplications and has a relatively low number of copies. Examination of transcripts from the PgCad1 locus revealed that CR1-1_Pg disrupts both the cadherin protein and a long noncoding RNA of unknown function. Together with previously reported data, these findings show that transposable elements disrupt eight of 12 cadherin alleles linked with resistance to Cry1Ac in three lepidopteran species, indicating that the cadherin locus is a common target for disruption by transposable elements. 
<h3>21529147</h3>Growth inhibition of <span class="annotated ">Beauveria bassiana</span> by bacteria isolated from the cuticular surface of the <span class="annotated ">corn leafhopper</span>, <span class="annotated ">Dalbulus maidis</span> and the planthopper, <span class="annotated ">Delphacodes kuscheli</span>, two important vectors of <span class="unannotated ">maize</span> pathogens. <br><br>The phytosanitary importance of the <span class="annotated ">corn</span> leafhopper, <span class="unannotated ">Dalbulus maidis</span> (De Long and Wolcott) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) and the planthopper, <span class="unannotated ">Delphacodes kuscheli</span> Fennah (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) lies in their ability to transmit phloem-associated plant pathogens, mainly viruses and mollicutes, and to cause considerable mechanical damage to <span class="unannotated ">corn</span> plants during feeding and oviposition. Fungi, particularly some members of the Ascomycota, are likely candidates for biocontrol agents against these insect pests, but several studies revealed their failure to invade the insect cuticle possibly because of the presence of inhibitory compounds such as phenols, quinones, and lipids and also by the antibiosis effect of the microbiota living on the cuticular surface of the host. The present work aims to understand interactions between the entomopathogenic fungus <span class="annotated ">Beauveria bassiana</span> (Balsamao-Crivelli) Vuillemin (Hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae) and bacterial antagonists isolated from the cuticular surface of <span class="annotated ">D. maidis</span> and <span class="annotated ">D. kuscheli</span>. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> total of 155 bacterial isolates were recovered from the insect's cuticle and tested against <span class="annotated ">B. bassiana</span>. Ninety-one out of 155 strains inhibited the growth of <span class="annotated ">B. bassiana</span>. Bacterial strains isolated from <span class="annotated ">D. maidis</span> were significantly more antagonistic against <span class="annotated ">B. bassiana</span> than those isolates from <span class="annotated ">D. kuscheli</span>. Among the most effective antagonistic strains, six isolates of <span class="match annotated ">Bacillus thuringiensis</span> Berliner (Bacillales: Bacillaeae (after <span class="annotated ">B. subtilis</span>)), one isolate of <span class="annotated ">B. mycoides</span> Flugge, eight isolates of <span class="annotated ">B. megaterium</span> de Bary, five isolates of <span class="annotated ">B.pumilus</span> Meyer and Gottheil, one isolate of <span class="annotated ">B. licheniformis</span> (Weigmann) Chester, and four isolates of <span class="annotated ">B. subtilis</span> (Ehrenberg) Cohn were identified. 
<h3>21205278</h3>Molecular characterization of three genes encoding aminopeptidases N in the <span class="annotated ">poplar leaf beetle</span> <span class="annotated ">Chrysomela tremulae</span>. <br><br>Three genes encoding proteins showing sequence similarity and features typical of insect APNs were characterized in <span class="annotated ">C. tremulae</span> and designed as CtAPN1, CtAPN2 and CtAPN3. Expression analysis of the three <span class="annotated ">C. tremulae</span> APN genes showed that CtAPN2 transcript is more abundant in the fat body, whereas both CtAPN1 and CtAPN3 are specifically expressed in the midgut. Despite a similar genomic organization, lepidopteran and coleopteran APNs are phylogenetically distant, suggesting that APN gene duplication events occurred after these two insect orders split. Sequence and expression comparisons of CtAPN1, CtAPN2 and CtAPN3 cDNAs in a <span class="annotated ">C. tremulae</span> <span class="match annotated ">Bacillus thuringiensis</span> (<span class="annotated ">Bt</span>)-susceptible and in a <span class="annotated ">Bt</span>-resistant strain did not show any polymorphism at the amino acid level or difference at the transcription level.
