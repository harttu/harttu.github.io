<h2>M. oryzae</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEAUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21600998</h3>The cell cycle gene MoCDC15 regulates hyphal growth, asexual development and plant infection in the <span class="annotated ">rice blast pathogen</span> <span class="annotated ">Magnaporthe oryzae</span>. <br><br>Rice blast, caused by the pathogen <span class="annotated ">Magnaporthe oryzae</span>, is a serious hindrance to <span class="annotated ">rice</span> production and has emerged as an important model for the characterization of molecular mechanisms relevant to pathogenic development in plants. Similar to other pathogenic fungi, conidiation plays a central role in initiation of <span class="annotated ">M.oryzae</span> infection and spread over a large area. However, relatively little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms that underlie conidiation in <span class="match annotated ">M. oryzae</span>. To better characterize these mechanisms, we identified a conidiation-defective mutant, <span class="annotated ">ATMT0225B6</span> (<span class="annotated ">MoCDC15(T-DNA)</span>), in which a T-DNA insertion disrupted a gene that encodes a homolog of fission <span class="annotated ">yeast</span> cdc15, and generated a second strain containing a disruption in the same allele (DeltaMoCDC15(T-DNA)). The cdc15 gene has been shown to act as a coordinator of the cell cycle in <span class="annotated ">yeast</span>. Functional analysis of the <span class="unannotated ">MoCDC15(T-DNA)</span> and DeltaMoCDC15(T-DNA) mutants revealed that MoCDC15 is required for conidiation, preinfection development and pathogenicity in <span class="match annotated ">M. oryzae</span>. Conidia from these mutants were viable, but failed to adhere to hydrophobic surface, a crucial step required for subsequent pathogenic development. All phenotypic defects observed in mutants were rescued in a strain complemented with <span class="annotated ">wild type MoCDC15</span>. Together, these data indicate that MoCDC15 functions as a coordinator of several biological processes important for pathogenic development in <span class="match annotated ">M. oryzae</span>. 
<h3>21241815</h3>Genetic and molecular characterization of a blue light photoreceptor MGWC-1 in <span class="annotated ">Magnaporth oryzae</span>. <br><br>Three key factors involved in successful plant disease development include the presence of a susceptible host, a virulent pathogen, and a disease-conducive environment. Our understanding of how environmental factors influence disease-conducive or disease-suppressive conditions, and how a pathogen advantageously capitalizes on them, is quite limited. Utilizing the model pathosystem <span class="annotated ">Magnaporthe oryzae</span>-<span class="annotated ">Oryza sativa</span>, we found a significant light-dependent disease suppression. Our genetic data suggest that the blue-light receptor MGWC-1 in <span class="match annotated ">M. oryzae</span> is involved in light-dependent disease suppression during the dark-phase (disease-conducive light condition) immediately after pathogen-host contact. Sensing &quot;darkness&quot; is accomplished by MGWC-1, a blue-light receptor in <span class="match annotated ">M. oryzae</span>. To explore the potential molecular mechanisms of light-dependent disease suppression we performed a genome-wide microarray experiment and identified several groups of gene families that are differentially regulated during the light-to-dark transition. Our genetic and molecular data provide insights into how a <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> pathogen utilizes ambient light signals for successful disease development.
