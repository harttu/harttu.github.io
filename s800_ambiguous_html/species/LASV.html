<h2>LASV</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20980515</h3>Reverse genetics generation of chimeric infectious Junin/Lassa <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> is dependent on interaction of homologous glycoprotein stable signal peptide and G2 cytoplasmic domains. <br><br>The Arenaviridae are a diverse and globally distributed collection of viruses that are maintained primarily by <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">rodent</span> reservoirs. <span class="annotated ">Junin virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">JUNV</span>) and <span class="annotated ">Lassa virus</span> (<span class="match annotated ">LASV</span>) can both cause significant outbreaks of severe and often fatal <span class="annotated ">human</span> disease throughout their respective areas of endemicity. In an effort to improve upon the existing live attenuated <span class="annotated ">JUNV</span> Candid1 vaccine, we generated a genetically homogenous stock of this <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> from cDNA copies of the <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> S and L segments by using a reverse genetics system. Further, these cDNAs were used in combination with <span class="match annotated ">LASV</span> cDNAs to successfully generate two recombinant Candid1 <span class="annotated ">JUNV</span>/<span class="match annotated ">LASV</span> chimeric viruses (via envelope glycoprotein [GPC] exchange). It was found that while the GPC extravirion domains were readily exchangeable, homologous stable signal peptide (SSP) and G2 transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail domains were essential for correct GPC maturation and production of infectious chimeric viruses. The switching of the <span class="annotated ">JUNV</span> and <span class="match annotated ">LASV</span> G1/G2 ectodomains within the Candid1 vaccine background did not alter the attenuated phenotype of the vaccine strain in a lethal <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> model. These recombinant chimeric viruses shed light on the fundamental requirements of arenavirus GPC maturation and may serve as a strategy for the development of bivalent <span class="annotated ">JUNV</span> and <span class="match annotated ">LASV</span> vaccine candidates.
