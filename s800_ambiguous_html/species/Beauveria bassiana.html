<h2>Beauveria bassiana</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21521145</h3>Occurrence of entomopathogenic fungi from agricultural and natural ecosystems in Saltillo, Mexico, and their virulence towards thrips and whiteflies. <br><br>Entomopathogenic fungi were collected from soil in four adjacent habitats (oak forest, agricultural soil, pine reforestation and chaparral habitat) in Saltillo, Mexico using the insect bait method with <span class="annotated ">Tenebrio molitor</span> (L.) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) larvae as bait. Overall, of the larvae exposed to soil, 171 (20%) hosted <span class="match annotated ">Beauveria bassiana</span> (Balsamo) Vuillemin (Hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae), 25 (3%) hosted <span class="annotated ">Metarhizium anisopliae</span> (Metschnikoff) Sorokin (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae) and 1 (0.1%) hosted <span class="annotated ">lsaria (=Paecilomyces) sp.</span> (Hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae). <span class="annotated ">B. bassiana</span> was significantly more frequent on larvae exposed to oak forest soil. <span class="annotated ">M. anisopliae</span> was significantly more frequent on larvae exposed to agricultural soil. From the infected bait insects, 93 isolates of <span class="annotated ">B. bassiana</span> and 24 isolates of <span class="annotated ">M. anisopliae</span> were obtained. Strains were tested for their infectivity against <span class="annotated ">Cuban laurel thrips</span>, <span class="annotated ">Gynaikothrips uzeli</span> Zimmerman (Thysanoptera: Phlaeothripidae) and the <span class="annotated ">greenhouse whitefly</span>, <span class="annotated ">Trialeurodes vaporariorum</span> (Westwood) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae). <span class="annotated ">B. bassiana</span> isolates caused the highest mortality on thrips (some causing 88% mortality after 6 days); both fungal species caused similarly high mortality levels against whiteflies (75%) after 6 days. Large amounts of germplasm of entomopathogenic fungi, fundamentally <span class="annotated ">B. bassiana</span> and <span class="annotated ">M. anisopliae</span>, exist in the habitats sampled; pathogenicity varied among strains, and some strains possessed significant virulence. Soils in these habitats are reservoirs of diverse strains with potential for use in biocontrol. 
<h3>21529147</h3>Growth inhibition of <span class="match annotated ">Beauveria bassiana</span> by bacteria isolated from the cuticular surface of the <span class="annotated ">corn leafhopper</span>, <span class="annotated ">Dalbulus maidis</span> and the planthopper, <span class="annotated ">Delphacodes kuscheli</span>, two important vectors of <span class="annotated ">maize</span> pathogens. <br><br>The phytosanitary importance of the <span class="annotated ">corn leafhopper</span>, <span class="annotated ">Dalbulus maidis</span> (De Long and Wolcott) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) and the planthopper, <span class="annotated ">Delphacodes kuscheli</span> Fennah (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) lies in their ability to transmit phloem-associated plant pathogens, mainly <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span> and mollicutes, and to cause considerable mechanical damage to <span class="annotated ">corn</span> plants during feeding and oviposition. Fungi, particularly some members of the Ascomycota, are likely candidates for biocontrol agents against these insect pests, but several studies revealed their failure to invade the insect cuticle possibly because of the presence of inhibitory compounds such as phenols, quinones, and lipids and also by the antibiosis effect of the microbiota living on the cuticular surface of the host. The present work aims to understand interactions between the entomopathogenic fungus <span class="match annotated ">Beauveria bassiana</span> (Balsamao-Crivelli) Vuillemin (Hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae) and bacterial antagonists isolated from the cuticular surface of <span class="annotated ">D. maidis</span> and <span class="annotated ">D. kuscheli</span>. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> total of 155 bacterial isolates were recovered from the insect's cuticle and tested against <span class="annotated ">B. bassiana</span>. Ninety-one out of 155 strains inhibited the growth of <span class="annotated ">B. bassiana</span>. Bacterial strains isolated from <span class="annotated ">D. maidis</span> were significantly more antagonistic against <span class="annotated ">B. bassiana</span> than those isolates from <span class="annotated ">D. kuscheli</span>. Among the most effective antagonistic strains, six isolates of <span class="annotated ">Bacillus thuringiensis</span> Berliner (Bacillales: Bacillaeae (after <span class="annotated ">B. subtilis</span>)), one isolate of <span class="annotated ">B. mycoides</span> Flugge, eight isolates of <span class="annotated ">B. megaterium</span> de Bary, five isolates of <span class="annotated ">B.pumilus</span> Meyer and Gottheil, one isolate of <span class="annotated ">B. licheniformis</span> (Weigmann) Chester, and four isolates of <span class="annotated ">B. subtilis</span> (Ehrenberg) Cohn were identified. 
<h3>22182612</h3>Comparative Impact of Artificial Selection for Fungicide Resistance on <span class="match annotated ">Beauveria bassiana</span> and <span class="annotated ">Metarhizium brunneum</span>. <br><br>Hypocreales fungi such as <span class="match annotated ">Beauveria bassiana</span> (Balsamo) Vuillemin and <span class="annotated ">Metarhizium brunneum</span> Petch can be negatively affected by fungicides thereby reducing their biocontrol potential. In a previous study, we demonstrated enhanced fungicide resistance in <span class="annotated ">B. bassiana</span> through artificial selection. However, it is not clear if the enhanced resistance was because of improved germination, vegetative growth, or both. Additionally, the enhanced fungicide resistance has only been demonstrated in <span class="annotated ">B. bassiana</span>, and therefore it is of interest to investigate the potential to enhance resistance in other fungi. Thus, the objectives in this study were to determine the potential to enhance fungicide resistance in <span class="annotated ">M. brunneum</span> through artificial selection, and investigate if selection is based on germination, vegetative growth, or both in <span class="annotated ">B. bassiana</span> and <span class="annotated ">M. brunneum</span>. Selection for resistance to fenbuconazole, and triphenyltin hydroxide was assessed through inhibition evaluations on solid media, and germination and mycelial growth in liquid media. Increased resistance after selection was observed for all fungicide-fungus combinations on solid and or liquid media. Selection resulted in increased resistance to fenbuconazole in both fungi in solid and liquid media; in liquid culture fungicide resistance in <span class="annotated ">B. bassiana</span> was manifested by increased germination and mycelial growth, whereas in <span class="annotated ">M. brunneum</span> fungicide resistance concerned only mycelial growth. Selection for resistance to triphenyltin hydroxide varied in the different media. For <span class="annotated ">B. bassiana</span>, triphenyltin hydroxide resistance was enhanced on solid media but not in liquid, whereas enhanced resistance of <span class="annotated ">M. brunneum</span> was detected in both media. Fungicide sensitivity and selection potential differs based on the medium and fungal species. Selection for fungicide resistance, had negative effects on other beneficial traits when fungicide pressure was removed, for example, some selected populations showed decreased germination or growth, relative to their nonselected control populations. Additionally, reduced virulence to the <span class="annotated ">greater wax moth</span>, <span class="annotated ">Galleria mellonella</span> (L.), was observed in all fungal populations that were exposed to fungicide resistance regimes. We conclude that it is possible to use genetic selection to enhance fungicide resistance in <span class="annotated ">B. bassiana</span> and <span class="annotated ">M. brunneum</span>, but before use the resulting populations should be screened for inadvertent negative impacts on beneficial traits.
