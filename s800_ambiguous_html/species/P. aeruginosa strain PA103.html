<h2>P. aeruginosa strain PA103</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21148734</h3>Relating the physical properties of <span class="annotated ">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> lipopolysaccharides to virulence by atomic force microscopy. <br><br>Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are an important class of macromolecules that are components of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria such as <span class="annotated ">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>. <span class="annotated ">P. aeruginosa</span> contains two different sugar chains, the homopolymer common antigen (A band) and the heteropolymer <span class="unannotated ">O</span> antigen (B band), which impart serospecificity. The characteristics of LPS are generally assessed after isolation rather than in the context of whole bacteria. Here we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to probe the physical properties of the LPS of <span class="match annotated ">P. aeruginosa strain PA103</span> (serogroup O11) in situ. This strain contains a mixture of long and very long polymers of <span class="unannotated ">O</span> antigen, regulated by two different genes. For this analysis, we studied the wild-type strain and four mutants, DeltaWzz1 (producing only very long LPS), DeltaWzz2 (producing only long LPS), DDeltaM (with both the wzz1 and wzz2 genes deleted), and Wzy::GM (producing an LPS core oligosaccharide plus one unit of <span class="unannotated ">O</span> antigen). Forces of adhesion between the LPS on these strains and the silicon nitride AFM tip were measured, and the Alexander and de Gennes model of steric repulsion between a flat surface and a polymer brush was used to calculate the LPS layer thickness (which we refer to as length), compressibility, and spacing between the individual molecules. LPS chains were longest for the wild-type strain and DeltaWzz1, at 170.6 and 212.4 nm, respectively, and these values were not statistically significantly different from one another. Wzy::GM and DDeltaM have reduced LPS lengths, at 34.6 and 37.7 nm, respectively. Adhesion forces were not correlated with LPS length, but a relationship between adhesion force and bacterial pathogenicity was found in a <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> acute pneumonia model of infection. The adhesion forces with the AFM probe were lower for strains with LPS mutations, suggesting that the wild-type strain is optimized for maximal adhesion. Our research contributes to further understanding of the role of LPS in the adhesion and virulence of <span class="annotated ">P. aeruginosa</span>.
