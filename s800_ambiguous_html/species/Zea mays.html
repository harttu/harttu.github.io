<h2>Zea mays</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20840610</h3>The role of abscisic acid and water stress in root herbivore-induced leaf resistance. <br><br>* Herbivore-induced systemic resistance occurs in many plants and is commonly assumed to be adaptive. The mechanisms triggered by leaf-herbivores that lead to systemic resistance are largely understood, but it remains unknown how and why root herbivory also increases resistance in leaves. * To resolve this, we investigated the mechanism by which the root herbivore <span class="annotated ">Diabrotica virgifera</span> induces resistance against lepidopteran herbivores in the leaves of <span class="match annotated ">Zea mays</span>. * <span class="annotated ">Diabrotica virgifera</span> infested plants suffered less aboveground herbivory in the field and showed reduced growth of <span class="annotated ">Spodoptera littoralis</span> caterpillars in the laboratory. Root herbivory did not lead to a jasmonate-dependent response in the leaves, but specifically triggered water loss and abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation. The induction of ABA by itself was partly responsible for the induction of leaf defenses, but not for the resistance against <span class="annotated ">S. littoralis</span>. Root-herbivore induced hydraulic changes in the leaves, however, were crucial for the increase in insect resistance. * We conclude that the induced leaf resistance after root feeding is the result of hydraulic changes, which reduce the quality of the leaves for chewing herbivores. This finding calls into question whether root-herbivore induced leaf-resistance is an evolved response. 
<h3>20880205</h3>Factors required for the high CO2 specificity of the anaerobically induced <span class="annotated ">maize</span> GapC4 promoter in transgenic <span class="annotated ">tobacco</span>. <br><br>Flooding, a natural cause of anaerobiosis, is often accompanied by high CO(2) concentrations in the flood water. Plants need to respond to these environmental conditions. Strong anaerobic reporter gene activity in <span class="annotated ">tobacco</span> (<span class="annotated ">Nicotiana tabacum</span>) controlled by the glycolytic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GapC4) promoter from <span class="annotated ">maize</span> (<span class="match annotated ">Zea mays</span>) depends on the presence of CO(2) and light. To identify factors required for CO(2) regulated gene expression, promoter deletions fused to the Beta-glucuronidase reporter gene were studied in transgenic <span class="annotated ">tobacco</span>. Deletion of a 40 bp fragment directly upstream of the TATA box leads to increased anaerobic reporter gene activity both, in the presence and absence of CO(2). This deletion does not affect light specific anaerobic expression. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> positive correlation between increasing CO(2) concentrations and gene activity is observed. Electrophoretic mobility shift experiments indicate that <span class="annotated ">tobacco</span> nuclear extracts harbour proteins that bind to part of the 40 bp fragment. Database assisted as well as experimental analysis reveal a role for AP2/EREBP transcription factors for conferring the high CO(2) specificity to the GapC4 promoter in <span class="annotated ">tobacco</span> leaves. This work highlights the importance for plants to respond to high environmental CO(2) concentrations under anaerobic conditions. 
<h3>20946131</h3>Host plant secondary metabolite profiling shows a complex, strain-dependent response of <span class="annotated ">maize</span> to plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria of the genus Azospirillum. <br><br>Most Azospirillum plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) benefit plant growth through source effects related to free nitrogen fixation and/or phytohormone production, but little is known about their potential effects on plant physiology. These effects were assessed by comparing the early impacts of three Azospirillum inoculant strains on secondary metabolite profiles of two different <span class="annotated ">maize</span> (<span class="match annotated ">Zea mays</span>) cultivars. After 10d of growth in nonsterile soil, <span class="annotated ">maize</span> methanolic extracts were analyzed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and secondary metabolites identified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Seed inoculation resulted in increased shoot biomass (and also root biomass with one strain) of hybrid PR37Y15 but had no stimulatory effect on hybrid DK315. In parallel, Azospirillum inoculation led to major qualitative and quantitative modifications of the contents of secondary metabolites, especially benzoxazinoids, in the <span class="annotated ">maize</span> plants. These modifications depended on the PGPR strainxplant cultivar combination. Thus, Azospirillum inoculation resulted in early, strain-dependent modifications in the biosynthetic pathways of benzoxazine derivatives in <span class="annotated ">maize</span> in compatible interactions. This is the first study documenting a PGPR effect on plant secondary metabolite profiles, and suggests the establishment of complex interactions between Azospirillum PGPR and <span class="unannotated ">maize</span>. 
<h3>21039559</h3>Systemic virus-induced gene silencing allows functional characterization of <span class="annotated ">maize</span> genes during biotrophic interaction with <span class="annotated ">Ustilago maydis</span>. <br><br>Infection of <span class="annotated ">maize</span> (<span class="match annotated ">Zea mays</span>) plants with the <span class="annotated ">corn</span> smut fungus <span class="annotated ">Ustilago maydis</span> leads to the formation of large tumors on the stem, leaves and inflorescences. In this biotrophic interaction, plant defense responses are actively suppressed by the pathogen, and previous transcriptome analyses of infected <span class="annotated ">maize</span> plants showed massive and stage-specific changes in host gene expression during disease progression. To identify <span class="annotated ">maize</span> genes that are functionally involved in the interaction with <span class="annotated ">U. maydis</span>, we adapted a virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) system based on the brome mosaic <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> (BMV) for <span class="annotated ">maize</span>. Conditions were established that allowed successful <span class="annotated ">U. maydis</span> infection of BMV-preinfected <span class="unannotated ">maize</span> plants. This set-up enabled quantification of VIGS and its impact on <span class="annotated ">U. maydis</span> infection using a quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)-based readout. In proof-of-principle experiments, an <span class="annotated ">U. maydis</span>-induced terpene synthase was shown to negatively regulate disease development while a protein involved in cell death inhibition was required for full virulence of <span class="unannotated ">U. maydis</span>. The results suggest that this system is a versatile tool for the rapid identification of <span class="annotated ">maize</span> genes that determine compatibility with <span class="annotated ">U. maydis</span>. 
<h3>21526935</h3>Assessment of attractiveness of <span class="annotated ">cassava</span> as a roosting plant for the <span class="annotated ">melon fly</span>, <span class="annotated ">Bactrocera cucurbitae</span>, and the <span class="annotated ">Oriental fruit fly</span>, <span class="annotated ">B. dorsalis</span>. <br><br>Application of bait spray to crop borders is a standard approach for suppression of <span class="annotated ">melon fly</span>, <span class="annotated ">Bactrocera cucurbitae</span> (Coquillett) (Diptera: Tephritidae) populations and may also be of value for suppression of <span class="annotated ">oriental fruit fly</span>, <span class="annotated ">B. dorsalis</span> (Hendel) populations. Establishment of preferred roosting hosts as crop borders may help to improve suppression of both fruit <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">fly</span> species by providing sites for bait spray applications. In an area-wide <span class="annotated ">B. cucurbitae</span> suppression trial, the question was raised as to whether <span class="annotated ">cassava</span>, <span class="annotated ">Manihot esculenta</span> Crantz (Euphorbiales: Euphorbiaceae), could be used as a <span class="annotated ">B. cucurbitae</span> roosting host. <span class="annotated ">M. esculenta</span> was of interest as a roosting host because, in contrast to many other identified preferred roosting hosts, it would also be a crop potentially increasing the productivity of the crop production system overall. As a short-lived and shrubby perennial, <span class="annotated ">M. esculenta</span> potentially constitutes a crop with more persistent roosting foliage than an annual crop such as <span class="annotated ">corn</span>, <span class="match annotated ">Zea mays</span> L. (Cyperales: Poaceae), that has often been planted as a roosting host for <span class="annotated ">B. cucurbitae</span> control. Using protein-baited traps set amidst potted plants placed adjacent to a <span class="annotated ">papaya</span> <span class="annotated ">Carica papaya</span> L. (Violales: Caricaceae) orchard known to have established populations of <span class="annotated ">B. cucurbitae</span> and <span class="annotated ">B. dorsalis</span>, the effectiveness of <span class="annotated ">M. esculenta</span> as a roosting host was assessed by comparing its attractiveness to that of <span class="annotated ">castor bean</span>, <span class="annotated ">Ricinus communis</span> L (Malpighiales: Euphorbiaceae), previously identified as one of the most attractive roosting hosts for <span class="annotated ">B. cucurbitae</span>, and to <span class="annotated ">corn</span>, a crop which has been planted as a roosting host for help in <span class="annotated ">B. cucurbitae</span> control. The results showed that use of <span class="annotated ">M. esculenta</span> as a roosting host is comparable to use of <span class="annotated ">R. communis</span> by both <span class="annotated ">B. cucurbitae</span> and <span class="annotated ">B. dorsalis</span>. These results provide encouragement to incorporate <span class="annotated ">M. esculenta</span> on a farm as a trap crop (i.e. site for bait spray application). This has the advantage of having the trap crop be a crop on its own (as opposed to <span class="annotated ">castor bean</span>) and, among prospective crops that could be used as a trap crop, has foliage more persistent than an annual trap crop such as <span class="annotated ">corn</span>. 
<h3>21054434</h3>Acclimation to high CO2 in <span class="annotated ">maize</span> is related to water status and dependent on leaf rank. <br><br>The responses of C(3) plants to rising atmospheric CO(2) levels are considered to be largely dependent on effects exerted through altered photosynthesis. In contrast, the nature of the responses of C(4) plants to high CO(2) remains controversial because of the absence of CO(2) -dependent effects on photosynthesis. In this study, the effects of atmospheric CO(2) availability on the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome profiles of two ranks of source leaves in <span class="annotated ">maize</span> (<span class="match annotated ">Zea mays</span> L.) were studied in plants grown under ambient CO(2) conditions (350 +/- 20 muL L(-1) CO(2) ) or with CO(2) enrichment (700 +/- 20 muL L(-1) CO(2) ). Growth at high CO(2) had no effect on photosynthesis, photorespiration, leaf C/N ratios or anthocyanin contents. However, leaf transpiration rates, carbohydrate metabolism and protein carbonyl accumulation were altered at high CO(2) in a leaf-rank specific manner. Although no significant CO(2) -dependent changes in the leaf transcriptome were observed, qPCR analysis revealed that the abundance of transcripts encoding a Bowman-Birk protease inhibitor and a serpin were changed by the growth CO(2) level in a leaf rank specific manner. Moreover, CO(2) -dependent changes in the leaf proteome were most evident in the oldest source leaves. Small changes in water status may be responsible for the observed responses to high CO(2,) particularly in the older leaf ranks.
