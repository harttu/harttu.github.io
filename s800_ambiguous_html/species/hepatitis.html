<h2>hepatitis</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20863856</h3>Expression of the C-terminal ORF2 protein of <span class="annotated ">duck astrovirus</span> for application in a serological test. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Duck astrovirus</span> (<span class="annotated ">DAstV</span>) is an important pathogen causing duck <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> <span class="match unannotated ">hepatitis</span> (DVH), a highly contagious and fatal disease in young ducklings. To provide an antigen for a diagnostic serum test, the C-terminus of <span class="annotated ">DAstV</span> ORF2 protein was expressed in <span class="annotated ">Escherichia coli</span>. Four positive and 30 negative sera were used to validate the purified ORF2 protein by developing an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). No cross-reactions were found against other duck pathogens, including <span class="annotated ">duck hepatitis A virus</span>, <span class="annotated ">duck plague herpesvirus</span>, <span class="annotated ">duck reovirus</span>, <span class="annotated ">Newcastle disease virus</span>, and <span class="annotated ">Riemerella anatipestifer 12/19</span><span class="annotated ">Riemerella anatipestifer</span> 12/19 (63.2%) and 26/51 (51%) sera samples from two flocks of ducks that survived <span class="annotated ">DAstV</span> infections in commercial duck farms were positive for <span class="annotated ">DAstV</span> by this method, respectively. Interestingly, <span class="annotated ">DAstV</span>-specific antibodies were also detected in 12 (28.6%) of 42 sera samples from a different flock without DVH, indicating a wide distribution of subclinical infections caused by <span class="annotated ">DAstV</span>. 
<h3>20962099</h3>Replicative and transcriptional activities of <span class="annotated ">hepatitis B virus</span> in <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> coinfected with <span class="match unannotated ">hepatitis</span> B and <span class="annotated ">hepatitis delta viruses</span><span class="annotated ">viruses</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Hepatitis B virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">HBV</span>) and <span class="annotated ">hepatitis delta virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">HDV</span>) interplay was investigated by examining liver and serum samples from 21 coinfected and 22 <span class="annotated ">HBV</span>-monoinfected <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> with chronic liver disease. Different real-time PCR assays were applied to evaluate intrahepatic amounts of <span class="annotated ">HBV</span> DNA, covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), pregenomic RNA (pgRNA), pre-S/S RNAs, and <span class="annotated ">HDV</span> RNA. Besides <span class="annotated ">HBV</span> DNA and <span class="annotated ">HDV</span> RNA levels, HBsAg concentrations in the sera were also determined. <span class="annotated ">HDV</span>-coinfected cases showed significantly lower median levels of serum <span class="annotated ">HBV</span> DNA (-5 log), intrahepatic relaxed-circular DNA (-2 log), and cccDNA (-2 log) than those of <span class="annotated ">HBV</span>-monoinfected cases. Interestingly, pgRNA and pre-S/S RNA amounts were significantly lower (both -1 log) in <span class="annotated ">HDV</span>-positive <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span>, whereas serum HBsAg concentrations were comparable between the two <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patient</span> groups. Pre-S/S RNA and HBsAg amounts per cccDNA molecule were higher in <span class="annotated ">HDV</span>-positive <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> (3-fold and 1 log, respectively), showing that <span class="annotated ">HBV</span> replication was reduced, whereas synthesis of envelope proteins was not specifically decreased. The ratios of cccDNA to intracellular total <span class="annotated ">HBV</span> DNA showed a larger proportion of cccDNA molecules in <span class="annotated ">HDV</span>-positive cases. For these <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span>, both intrahepatic and serum <span class="annotated ">HDV</span> RNA amounts were associated with cccDNA but not with HBsAg or <span class="annotated ">HBV</span> DNA levels. Finally, <span class="annotated ">HBV</span> genomes with large deletions in the basal core promoter/precore region were detected in 5/21 <span class="annotated ">HDV</span>-positive <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> but in no <span class="annotated ">HDV</span>-negative <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> and were associated with lower viremia levels. These findings provide significant information about the interference exerted by <span class="annotated ">HDV</span> on <span class="annotated ">HBV</span> replication and transcription activities in the <span class="annotated ">human</span> liver. 
<h3>21029749</h3>Double-antigen sandwich ELISA for the detection of anti-<span class="annotated ">hepatitis C virus</span> antibodies. <br><br>A double-antigen sandwich ELISA was developed a detection of <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> antibodies by a recombinant multi-epitope <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> antigen and a biotin-streptavidin amplification system. Three plasma specimens from 1708 individuals who were suspected previously to be <span class="annotated ">HCV</span>-positive using an <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> antibody diagnostic kit (Chuangxin, Xiamen, China) displayed negative results when using the ELISA. These results were validated by a recombinant immunoblotting assay (two were negative, and one was indeterminate). Among 889 blood specimens donated for clinical evaluation, 246 were positive and 630 were negative using the ELISA. The sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA were 98.7% and 100%, respectively. In 43 donors and 14 <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> with chronic <span class="match unannotated ">hepatitis</span> C, the detectable rates for <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> IgM by both ELISA and the <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> anti-IgM detection reagents (Huimin, Shenyang, China) were 100%, and the detectable rate for <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> IgG using an indirect <span class="annotated ">HCV</span>-antibody detection kit (GWK, Beijing, China) was 98.3%. Thus, the double-antigen sandwich ELISA exhibits strong specificity and sensitivity and has been approved by the China State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA). The performance of the double-antigen sandwich ELISA was similar to the Ortho ELISA 3.0. It did not give false-negative results otherwise IgM was undetectable using an indirect <span class="annotated ">HCV</span>-antibody detection kit. This ELISA provides another method for the detection of <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> antibodies. 
<h3>21511329</h3><span class="annotated ">Hepatitis delta virus</span>.<br><br><span class="annotated ">Hepatitis delta virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">HDV</span>) is a small, defective RNA virus that can infect only individuals who have <span class="annotated ">hepatitis B virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">HBV</span>); worldwide more than 15 million <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">people</span> are co-infected. There are eight reported genotypes of <span class="annotated ">HDV</span> with unexplained variations in their geographical distribution and pathogenicity. The <span class="annotated ">hepatitis D</span> virion is composed of a coat of <span class="annotated ">HBV</span> envelope proteins surrounding the nucleocapsid, which consists of a single-stranded, circular RNA genome complexed with delta antigen, the <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> protein. <span class="annotated ">HDV</span> is clinically important because although it suppresses <span class="annotated ">HBV</span> replication, it causes severe liver disease with rapid progression to cirrhosis and hepatic decompensation. The range of clinical presentation is wide, varying from mild disease to fulminant liver failure. The prevalence of <span class="annotated ">HDV</span> is declining in some endemic areas but increasing in northern and central Europe because of immigration. Treatment of <span class="annotated ">HDV</span> is with pegylated interferon alfa; however, response rates are poor. Increased understanding of the molecular virology of <span class="annotated ">HDV</span> will identify novel therapeutic targets for this most severe form of chronic <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> <span class="match unannotated ">hepatitis</span>. 
<h3>21227500</h3>Continuing challenge of infectious diseases in India.<br><br>In India, the range and burden of infectious diseases are enormous. The administrative responsibilities of the health system are shared between the central (federal) and state governments. Control of diseases and outbreaks is the responsibility of the central Ministry of Health, which lacks a formal public health department for this purpose. Tuberculosis, malaria, filariasis, visceral leishmaniasis, leprosy, <span class="annotated ">HIV</span> infection, and childhood cluster of vaccine-preventable diseases are given priority for control through centrally managed vertical programmes. Control of <span class="annotated ">HIV</span> infection and leprosy, but not of tuberculosis, seems to be on track. Early success of malaria control was not sustained, and visceral leishmaniasis prevalence has increased. Inadequate containment of the vector has resulted in recurrent outbreaks of <span class="annotated ">dengue</span> fever and re-emergence of <span class="annotated ">Chikungunya virus</span> disease and typhus fever. Other infectious diseases caused by faecally transmitted pathogens (enteric fevers, cholera, <span class="annotated ">hepatitis A</span><span class="match annotated ">hepatitis</span> A and E viruses) and zoonoses (rabies, leptospirosis, anthrax) are not in the process of being systematically controlled. Big gaps in the surveillance and response system for infectious diseases need to be addressed. Replication of the model of vertical single-disease control for all infectious diseases will not be efficient or viable. India needs to rethink and revise its health policy to broaden the agenda of disease control. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> comprehensive review and redesign of the health system is needed urgently to ensure equity and quality in health care. We recommend the creation of a functional public health infrastructure that is shared between central and state governments, with professional leadership and a formally trained public health cadre of personnel who manage an integrated control mechanism of diseases in districts that includes infectious and non-infectious diseases, and injuries.
