<h2>Atlantic salmon</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21155770</h3>Competitive interactions shape offspring performance in relation to seasonal timing of emergence in <span class="match annotated ">Atlantic salmon</span>. <br><br>1. Timing of birth/hatching may have strong effects on offspring fitness. Breeding time is generally considered to have evolved to match offspring arrival with optimal seasonal environmental conditions, though this is rarely tested experimentally and factors shaping the relations between timing of birth and reproductive success are often poorly understood. 2. By manipulating incubation temperature of <span class="match annotated ">Atlantic salmon</span> embryos, and hence controlling for maternal and genetic effects, we obtained offspring emerging from nests prior to (accelerated), during and after (decelerated) normal emergence times, and accordingly experienced widely different seasonal environmental conditions at emergence (stream temperature range 4-16 ^0C). The accelerated group emerged at temperatures that are generally considered to be highly sub-optimal for growth and likely imposes strong constraints on feeding and activity, and during a peak in water discharge which is expected to negatively influence habitat availability. 3. In the wild, overall mortality during the period after emergence was 79%, and was significantly affected by both release density and emergence timing. Accelerated offspring, which emerged earliest and experienced the harshest environmental conditions, had both highest survival and largest final body size. The effect was particularly strong at the high density release site, where survival of accelerated offspring was significantly higher than both the normal and decelerated groups. 4. In more controlled semi-natural environments, all developmental groups were able to perform well, but accelerated offspring had a relatively better performance than the later emerging offspring when density was high. Furthermore, the relative performance of the different groups was not sensitive to water discharge regimes (temporally stable vs. fluctuating). 5. These results suggest that the performance of offspring in relation to seasonal timing of emergence is highly affected by competitive interactions in <span class="match annotated ">Atlantic salmon</span>. Although a match between phenology and optimal seasonal environmental conditions may be highly important for organisms depending on specific resources that are only available during a limited period of the season, such resources may be available in variable amounts year around for many organisms. For these, offspring success may to a larger degree be shaped by the timing of their hatching/birth relative to each other, and particularly so under high population densities. 
<h3>21401593</h3>Behaviour during elevated water temperatures: can physiology explain movement of juvenile <span class="match annotated ">Atlantic salmon</span> to cool water? <br><br>1. Temperature governs most physiological processes in animals. Ectotherms behaviourally thermoregulate by selecting habitats with temperatures regulating their body temperature for optimal physiological functioning. However, ectotherms can experience temperature extremes forcing the organisms to seek temperature refuge. 2. Fish actively avoid potentially lethal temperatures by moving to cool-water sites created by inflowing tributaries and groundwater seeps. Juvenile <span class="match annotated ">Atlantic salmon</span> (<span class="annotated ">Salmo salar</span>) of different age classes exhibit different behavioural responses to elevated temperatures (>23 ^0C). Yearling (1+) and 2-year-old (2+) <span class="match annotated ">Atlantic salmon</span> often cease feeding, abandon territorial behaviour and swim continuously in aggregations in cool-water sites; whereas young-of-the-year (0+) fish continue defending territories and foraging. 3. This study determined whether the behavioural shift in older individuals (2+) occurred when basal metabolic rate, driven by increasing water temperature, reached the maximum metabolic rate such that anaerobic pathways were recruited to provide energy to support vital processes. Behaviour (feeding and stress responses), oxygen consumption, muscle lactate and glycogen, and circulating blood lactate and glucose concentrations were measured in wild 0+ and 2+ <span class="match annotated ">Atlantic salmon</span> acclimated to water temperatures between 16 and 28 ^0C. 4. Results indicate that oxygen consumption of the 2+ fish increased with temperature and reached a plateau at 24 ^0C, a temperature that corresponded to cessation of feeding and a significant increase in muscle and blood lactate levels. By contrast, oxygen consumption in 0+ fish did not reach a plateau, feeding continued and muscle lactate did not increase, even at the highest temperatures tested (28 ^0C). 5. To conclude, the experiment demonstrated that the 0+ and 2+ fish had different physiological responses to the elevated water temperatures. The results suggest that wild 2+ <span class="match annotated ">Atlantic salmon</span> employ behavioural responses (e.g. movement to cool-water sites) at elevated temperatures in an effort to mitigate physiological imbalances associated with an inability to support basal metabolism through aerobic metabolic processes. 
<h3>21466553</h3>Adaptive trade-offs in juvenile salmonid metabolism associated with habitat partitioning between <span class="annotated ">coho salmon</span> and <span class="annotated ">steelhead trout</span> in coastal streams. <br><br>1. Adaptive trade-offs are fundamental to the evolution of diversity and the coexistence of similar taxa and occur when complimentary combinations of traits maximize efficiency of resource exploitation or survival at different points on environmental gradients. 2. Standard metabolic rate (SMR) is a key physiological trait that reflects adaptations to baseline metabolic performance, whereas active metabolism reflects adaptations to variable metabolic output associated with performance related to foraging, predator avoidance, aggressive interactions or migratory movements. Benefits of high SMR and active metabolism may change along a resource (productivity) gradient, indicating that a trade-off exists among active metabolism, resting metabolism and energy intake. 3. We measured and compared SMR, maximal metabolic rate (MMR), aerobic scope (AS), swim performance (UCrit) and growth of juvenile hatchery and wild <span class="annotated ">steelhead</span> and <span class="annotated ">coho salmon</span> held on high- and low-food rations in order to better understand the potential significance of variation in SMR to growth, differentiation between species, and patterns of habitat use along a productivity gradient. 4. We found that differences in SMR, MMR, AS, swim performance and growth rate between <span class="annotated ">steelhead trout</span> and <span class="annotated ">coho salmon</span> were reduced in hatchery-reared fish compared with wild fish. Wild <span class="annotated ">steelhead</span> had a higher MMR, AS, swim performance and growth rate than wild <span class="annotated ">coho</span>, but adaptations between species do not appear to involve differences in SMR or to trade-off increased growth rate against lower swim performance, as commonly observed for high-growth strains. Instead, we hypothesize that wild <span class="annotated ">steelhead</span> may be trading off higher growth rate for lower food consumption efficiency, similar to strategies adopted by anadromous vs. resident <span class="annotated ">brook trout</span> and <span class="match annotated ">Atlantic salmon</span> vs. <span class="annotated ">brook trout</span>. This highlights potential differences in food consumption and digestion strategies as cryptic adaptations ecologically differentiating salmonid species. 5. We hypothesize that divergent digestive strategies, which are common and well documented among terrestrial vertebrates, may be an important but overlooked aspect of adaptive strategies of juvenile salmonids, and fish in general.
