<h2>B. tabaci</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21521136</h3>Host plant effects on alkaline phosphatase activity in the whiteflies, <span class="annotated ">Bemisia tabaci</span> Biotype B and <span class="annotated ">Trialeurodes vaporariorum</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Bemisia tabaci</span> (Gennadius) B-biotype and <span class="annotated ">Trialeurodes vaporariorum</span> (Westwood) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) often coexist on greenhouse-grown vegetable crops in northern China. The recent spread of <span class="match annotated ">B. tabaci</span> B-biotype has largely replaced <span class="annotated ">T. vaporariorum</span>, and B-biotype now overlaps with <span class="annotated ">T. vaporariorum</span> where common hosts occur in most invaded areas. The impact of the B-biotype on the agro eco system appears to be widespread, and involves the ability to compete with and perhaps replace other phytophages like <span class="annotated ">T. vaporariorum</span>. An emerging hypothesis is that the B-biotype is physiologically superior due at least in part to an improved ability to metabolically utilize the alkaline phosphatase pathway. To test this hypothesis, alkaline phosphatase activity was studied in the B-biotype and <span class="annotated ">T. vaporariorum</span> after feeding on a number of different hosts for a range of durations, with and without host switching. Alkaline phosphatase activity in <span class="annotated ">T. vaporariorum</span> was 1.45 to 2.53-fold higher than that of the B-biotype when fed on <span class="annotated ">tomato</span> for 4 and 24 h, or switched from <span class="annotated ">tomato</span> to <span class="annotated ">cotton</span> and <span class="annotated ">cabbage</span> for the same durations. However, alkaline phosphatase activity in the B-biotype was 1.40 to 3.35-fold higher than that of <span class="annotated ">T. vaporariorum</span> when the host switching time was -72 and -120 h on the same plant. Both short-term (4 h) and long-term (72 h) switching of plant hosts can significantly affect the alkaline phosphatase activity in the two species. After -120 h, feeding on <span class="annotated ">tomato</span> and <span class="annotated ">cotton</span> alkaline phosphatase activity in the B-biotype was significantly higher than that of <span class="annotated ">T. vaporariorum</span>. It was shown that alkaline phosphatase aids the species feeding on different plant species, and that the B-biotype is physiologically superior to <span class="annotated ">T. vaporariorum</span> in utilizing the enzyme compared to <span class="annotated ">T. vaporariorum</span> over longer periods of feeding. 
<h3>22182622</h3>Rapid Cold Hardening and Expression of Heat Shock Protein Genes in the B-Biotype <span class="annotated ">Bemisia tabaci</span>. <br><br>This paper describes the rapid cold hardening processes of the <span class="annotated ">sweetpotato whitefly</span>, <span class="annotated ">Bemisia tabaci</span> (Gennadius). It was found that all developmental stages of <span class="match annotated ">B. tabaci</span> have the capacity of rapid cold hardening and the length of time required to induce maximal cold hardiness at 0^0C varies with stage. There was only 18.3% survival when adult whiteflies were transferred directly from 26^0C to -8.5^0C for 2 h. However, exposure to 0^0C for 1 h before transfer to -8.5^0C increased the survival to 81.2%. The whiteflies show "prefreeze" mortality when they were exposed to temperatures above the supercooling point (SCP), although the range of SCP of whiteflies is -26^0C to -29^0C. The rapid cold hardening had no effect on SCP and reduced the lower lethal temperature of adults from -9^0C to -11^0C. Rapid cold-hardened adults had a similar lifespan as the control group but deposited fewer eggs than nonhardened individuals. The expression profiles during cold hardening and recovery from this process revealed that HSP90 did not respond to cold stress. However, HSP70 and HSP20 were significantly induced by cold with different temporal expression patterns. These results suggest that the rapid cold hardening response is possibly advantageous to whiteflies that are often exposed to drastic temperature fluctuations in spring or autumn in northern China, and the expression of HSP70 and HSP20 may be associated with the cold tolerance of <span class="match annotated ">B. tabaci</span>. 
<h3>22182623</h3>Interspecific Interactions Between <span class="annotated ">Bemisia tabaci</span> Biotype B and <span class="annotated ">Trialeurodes vaporariorum</span> (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae). <br><br><span class="annotated ">Bemisia tabaci</span> (Gennadius) biotype B and <span class="annotated ">Trialeurodes vaporariorum</span> (Westwood) are invasive whitefly species that often co-occur on greenhouse-grown vegetables in northern China. Although <span class="match annotated ">B. tabaci</span> biotype B has been present in China for a relatively short period of time, it has become dominant over <span class="annotated ">T. vaporariorum</span>. We studied the interspecific competitive interactions between the two species in single or mixed cultures at 24 +/- 1^0C, 40 +/- 5% RH, and L14:D10 h photoperiod. Female longevity on <span class="annotated ">tomato</span> was not significantly different between species, but <span class="match annotated ">B. tabaci</span> reproduced 4.3 to 4.9 fold more progeny. The ratio of female to male progeny in both instances was greater for <span class="match annotated ">B. tabaci</span>. When cultured on <span class="annotated ">tomato</span>, <span class="annotated ">cotton</span>, and <span class="annotated ">tobacco</span>, <span class="match annotated ">B. tabaci</span> developed 0.8, 3.3, and 4.7 d earlier in single culture, and 1.8, 3.9, and 4.3 d earlier in mixed culture. <span class="match annotated ">B. tabaci</span> displaced <span class="annotated ">T. vaporariorum</span> in four, five and six generations when the initial ratios of <span class="match annotated ">B. tabaci</span> to <span class="annotated ">T. vaporariorum</span> were 15:15, 20:10, or 10:20 on <span class="annotated ">tomato</span>. Populations of <span class="match annotated ">B. tabaci</span> were 2.3 fold higher than that of <span class="annotated ">T. vaporariorum</span> on <span class="annotated ">tomato</span> plants for seven consecutive generations in single culture. <span class="match annotated ">B. tabaci</span> performed better in development, survival, fecundity, and female ratio. We conclude that <span class="match annotated ">B. tabaci</span> could displace <span class="annotated ">T. vaporariorum</span> in as short as four generations in a controlled greenhouse environment when they start at equal proportions. Warmer greenhouse conditions and an increase in total greenhouse area could be contributing factors in the recent dominance of <span class="match annotated ">B. tabaci</span>.
