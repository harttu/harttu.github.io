<h2>A. niger</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEAUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21176790</h3>Characterization of a polyketide synthase in <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus niger</span> whose product is a precursor for both dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) melanin and naphtho-gamma-pyrone. <br><br>The genome sequencing of the fungus <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus niger</span> uncovered a large cache of genes encoding enzymes thought to be involved in the production of secondary metabolites yet to be identified. Identification and structural characterization of many of these predicted secondary metabolites are hampered by their low concentration relative to the known <span class="match annotated ">A. niger</span> metabolites such as the naphtho-gamma-pyrone family of polyketides. We deleted a non-reducing PKS gene in <span class="annotated ">A. niger strain</span> ATCC 11414, a daughter strain of <span class="annotated ">A. niger ATCC strain 1015</span> whose genome was sequenced by the DOE Joint Genome Institute. This PKS encoding gene we name albA is a predicted ortholog of alb1 from <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus fumigatus</span> which is responsible for production of the naphtho-gamma-pyrone precursor for the 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) melanin/spore pigment. Our results show that the <span class="annotated ">A. nigeralbA</span> PKS is responsible for both the production of the spore pigment precursor and a family of naphtho-gamma-pyrones commonly found in significant quantity in <span class="match annotated ">A. niger</span> culture extracts. The generation of an <span class="match annotated ">A. niger</span> strain devoid of naphtho-gamma-pyrones will greatly facilitate the elucidation of cryptic biosynthetic pathways in this organism. 
<h3>21277986</h3>The molecular and genetic basis of conidial pigmentation in <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus niger</span>.<br><br>A characteristic hallmark of <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus niger</span> is the formation of <span class="unannotated ">black</span> conidiospores. We have identified four loci involved in spore pigmentation of <span class="match annotated ">A. niger</span> by using a combined genomic and classical complementation approach. First, we characterized a newly isolated color mutant, colA, which lacked pigmentation resulting in white or colorless conidia. Pigmentation of the colA mutant was restored by a gene (An12g03950) which encodes a putative 4'phosphopantetheinyl transferase protein (PptA). 4'Phosphopantetheinyl transferase activity is required for the activation of Polyketide Synthases (PKSs) and/or Non-Ribosomal Peptide Synthases (NRPSs). The loci whose mutation resulted in fawn, olive, and brown color phenotypes were identified by complementation. The fawn phenotype was complemented by a PKS protein (FwnA, An09g05730), the ovlA mutant by An14g05350 (OlvA) and the brnA mutant by An14g05370 (BrnA), the respective homologs of alb1/pksP, ayg1 and abr1 in <span class="annotated ">A. fumigatus</span>. Targeted disruption of the pptA, fwnA, olvA and brnA genes confirmed the complementation results. Disruption of the pptA gene abolished synthesis of all polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides, while the naphtho-gamma-pyrone subclass of polyketides were specifically dependent on fwnA, and funalenone on fwnA, olvA and brnA. Thus, secondary metabolite profiling of the color mutants revealed a close relationship between polyketide synthesis and conidial pigmentation in <span class="match annotated ">A. niger</span>.
