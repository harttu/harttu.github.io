<h2>influenza A virus</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20962098</h3>PB2 residue 158 is a pathogenic determinant of pandemic <span class="annotated ">H1N1</span> and <span class="annotated ">H5 influenza a viruses</span> in <span class="annotated ">mice</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Influenza A viruses</span> are <span class="annotated ">human</span> and animal pathogens that cause morbidity and mortality, which range from mild to severe. The 2009 <span class="annotated ">H1N1</span> pandemic was caused by the emergence of a reassortant <span class="annotated ">H1N1</span> subtype (<span class="annotated ">H1N1pdm</span>) <span class="match annotated ">influenza A virus</span> containing gene segments that originally circulated in <span class="annotated ">human</span>, avian, and <span class="annotated ">swine</span> virus reservoirs. The molecular determinants of replication and pathogenesis of <span class="annotated ">H1N1pdm viruses</span> in <span class="annotated ">humans</span> and other mammals are poorly understood. Therefore, we set out to elucidate <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> determinants critical to the pathogenesis of this novel reassortant using a <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> model. We found that a glutamate-to-glycine substitution at residue 158 of the PB2 gene (PB2-E158G) increased the morbidity and mortality of the parental <span class="annotated ">H1N1pdm virus</span>. Results from mini-genome replication assays in <span class="annotated ">human</span> cells and virus titration in <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> tissues demonstrated that PB2-E158G is a pathogenic determinant, because it significantly increases <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> replication rates. The virus load in PB2-E158G-infected <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> lungs was 1,300-fold higher than that of the wild-type virus. Our data also show that PB2-E158G had a much stronger influence on the RNA replication and pathogenesis of <span class="annotated ">H1N1pdm viruses</span> than PB2-E627K, which is a known pathogenic determinant. Remarkably, PB2-E158G substitutions also altered the pathotypes of two avian <span class="annotated ">H5 viruses</span> in <span class="annotated ">mice</span>, indicating that this residue impacts genetically divergent <span class="annotated ">influenza A viruses</span> and suggesting that this region of PB2 could be a new antiviral target. Collectively, the data presented in this study demonstrate that PB2-E158G is a novel pathogenic determinant of <span class="annotated ">influenza A viruses</span> in the <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> model. We speculate that PB2-E158G may be important in the adaptation of avian PB2 genes to other mammals, and BLAST sequence analysis identified a naturally occurring <span class="annotated ">human</span> <span class="annotated ">H1N1pdm</span> isolate that has this substitution. Therefore, future surveillance efforts should include scrutiny of this region of PB2 because of its potential impact on pathogenesis. 
<h3>21047957</h3>Modification of nonstructural protein 1 of <span class="match annotated ">influenza A virus</span> by SUMO1.<br><br>Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is one of the major factors resulting in the efficient infection rate and high level of virulence of <span class="match annotated ">influenza A virus</span>. Although consisting of only approximately 230 amino acids, NS1 has the ability to interfere with several systems of the host <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> defense. In the present study, we demonstrate that NS1 of the highly pathogenic avian <span class="annotated ">influenza A/Duck/Hubei/L-1/2004 (H5N1) virus</span> interacts with <span class="annotated ">human</span> Ubc9, which is the E2 conjugating enzyme for sumoylation, and we show that SUMO1 is conjugated to <span class="annotated ">H5N1</span> NS1 in both transfected and infected cells. Furthermore, two lysine residues in the C terminus of NS1 were identified as SUMO1 acceptor sites. When the SUMO1 acceptor sites were removed by mutation, NS1 underwent rapid degradation. Studies of different <span class="match annotated ">influenza A virus</span> strains of <span class="annotated ">human</span> and avian origin showed that the majority of <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span> possess an NS1 protein that is modified by SUMO1, except for the recently emerged <span class="annotated ">swine-origin influenza A virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">S-OIV</span>) (H1N1). Interestingly, growth of a sumoylation-deficient WSN virus mutant was retarded compared to that of wild-type virus. Together, these results indicate that sumoylation enhances NS1 stability and thus promotes rapid growth of <span class="match annotated ">influenza A virus</span>.
