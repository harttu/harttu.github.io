<h2>Manihot glaziovii</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20923689</h3>Simultaneous virus-specific detection of the two <span class="annotated ">cassava</span> brown streak-associated viruses by RT-PCR reveals wide distribution in East Africa, mixed infections, and infections in <span class="match annotated ">Manihot glaziovii</span>. <br><br>The expanding <span class="annotated ">cassava</span> brown streak disease (CBSD) epidemic in East Africa is caused by two ipomoviruses (genus Ipomovirus; Potyviridae), namely, <span class="annotated ">Cassava brown streak virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">CBSV</span>), and <span class="annotated ">Ugandan cassava brown streak virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">UCBSV</span>) that was described recently. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based diagnostic method was developed in this study for simultaneous virus-specific detection of the two viruses. Results showed that <span class="annotated ">CBSV</span> and <span class="annotated ">UCBSV</span> are distributed widely in the highlands (> 1000 m above the sea level) of the Lake Victoria zone in Uganda and Tanzania and also in the Indian Ocean costal lowlands of Tanzania. Isolates of <span class="annotated ">UCBSV</span> from the Lake Victoria zone were placed to two phylogenetic clusters in accordance with their origin in Uganda or Tanzania, respectively. Mixed infections with <span class="annotated ">CBSV</span> and <span class="annotated ">UCBSV</span> were detected in many <span class="annotated ">cassava</span> plants in the areas surveyed. <span class="annotated ">CBSV</span> was also detected in the perennial species <span class="match annotated ">Manihot glaziovii</span> (DNA-barcoded in this study) in Tanzania, which revealed the first <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> reservoir other than <span class="annotated ">cassava</span>. The method for detection of <span class="annotated ">CBSV</span> and <span class="annotated ">UCBSV</span> described in this study has important applications for plant quarantine, resistance breeding of <span class="annotated ">cassava</span>, and studies on epidemiology and control of CBSD in East Africa.
