<h2>F. oxysporum</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20887797</h3>The FvMK1 mitogen-activated protein kinase gene regulates conidiation, pathogenesis, and fumonisin production in <span class="annotated ">Fusarium verticillioides</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Fusarium verticillioides</span> is one of the most important fungal pathogens to cause destructive diseases of <span class="annotated ">maize</span> worldwide. Fumonisins produced by the fungus are harmful to <span class="annotated ">human</span> and animal health. To date, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with pathogenicity and fumonisin biosynthesis in <span class="annotated ">F. verticillioides</span> is limited. Because MAP kinase pathways have been implicated in regulating diverse processes important for plant infection in phytopathogenic fungi, in this study we identified and functionally characterized the FvMK1 gene in <span class="annotated ">F. verticillioides</span>. FvMK1 is orthologous to FMK1 in <span class="match annotated ">F. oxysporum</span> and GPMK1 in <span class="annotated ">F. graminearum</span>. The Fvmk1 deletion mutant was reduced in vegetative growth and production of microconidia. However, it was normal in sexual reproduction and increased in the production of macroconidia. In infection assays with developing <span class="annotated ">corn</span> kernels, the Fvmk1 mutant was non-pathogenic and failed to colonize through wounding sites. It also failed to cause stalk rot symptoms beyond the inoculation sites on <span class="annotated ">corn</span> stalks, indicating that FvMK1 is essential for plant infection. Furthermore, the Fvmk1 mutant was significantly reduced in fumonisin production and expression levels of FUM1 and FUM8, two genes involved in fumonisin biosynthesis. The defects of the Fvmk1 mutant were fully complemented by re-introducing the wild type FvMK1 allele. These results demonstrate that FvMK1 plays critical roles in the regulation of vegetative growth, asexual reproduction, fumonisin biosynthesis, and pathogenicity. 
<h3>21907298</h3><span class="annotated ">Galleria mellonella</span> as model host for the trans-kingdom pathogen <span class="annotated ">Fusarium oxysporum</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Fusarium oxysporum</span>, the causal agent of vascular wilt disease, affects a wide range of plant species and can produce disseminated infections in <span class="annotated ">humans</span>. <span class="annotated ">F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici isolate FGSC 9935</span> causes disease both on <span class="annotated ">tomato</span> plants and immunodepressed <span class="annotated ">mice</span>, making it an ideal model for the comparative analysis of fungal virulence on plant and animal hosts. Here we tested the ability of <span class="annotated ">FGSC 9935</span> to cause disease in the <span class="annotated ">greater wax moth</span> <span class="annotated ">Galleria mellonella</span>, an invertebrate model host that is widely used for the study of microbial <span class="annotated ">human</span> pathogens. Injection of living but not of heat-killed microconidia into the hemocoel of <span class="annotated ">G. mellonella</span> larvae resulted in dose-dependent killing both at 30^0C and at 37^0C. Fluorescence microscopy of larvae inoculated with a <span class="match annotated ">F. oxysporum</span> transformant expressing GFP revealed hyphal proliferation within the hemocoel, interaction with <span class="annotated ">G. mellonella</span> hemocytes, and colonization of the killed insects by the fungus. Fungal gene knockout mutants previously tested in the <span class="annotated ">tomato</span> and immunodepressed <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> systems displayed a good correlation in virulence between the Galleria and the <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> model. Thus, Galleria represents a useful non-vertebrate infection model for studying virulence mechanisms of <span class="match annotated ">F. oxysporum</span> on animal hosts.
