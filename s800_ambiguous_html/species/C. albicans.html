<h2>C. albicans</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEAUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20637818</h3>The <span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span> Rgd1 is a RhoGAP protein involved in the control of filamentous growth. <br><br>Rho proteins are essential regulators of polarized growth in eukaryotic cells. These proteins are down-regulated in vivo by specific Rho GTPase Activating Proteins (RhoGAP). We investigated the role of Rgd1 RhoGAP, encoded by the <span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span> RGD1 gene. We demonstrated that CaCdc42, CaRho3 and CaRho4 proteins had an intrinsic GTPase activity and that CaRgd1 stimulates in vitro GTP hydrolysis of these GTPases. Deletion of RGD1 in <span class="match annotated ">C. albicans</span> results in sensitivity to low pH as already described for rgd1Delta in <span class="annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>. The role of Rgd1 in survival at low pH is conserved in the two <span class="unannotated ">yeast</span> species as the CaRGD1 gene complements the Scrgd1Delta sensitivity. By tagging the RhoGAP with GFP, we found that CaRgd1 is localized at the tip and cortex of growing cells and during cytokinesis at the septation sites in <span class="unannotated ">yeast</span> and filamentous forms. We investigated the effect of CaRgd1 on the control of the polarized growth. Removing CaRGD1 alleles increased filamentous growth and cells lacking CaRgd1 presented longer germ tubes. Conversely, RGD1 overexpression restricted hyphae growth. Our results demonstrate that Rgd1 is critical for filamentous formation in <span class="match annotated ">C. albicans</span> especially for filamentous elongation. 
<h3>21511047</h3>Milestones in <span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span> gene manipulation.<br><br>In the United States, candidemia is one of the most common hospital-acquired infections and is estimated to cause 10,000 deaths per year. The species <span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span> is responsible for the majority of these cases. As <span class="match annotated ">C. albicans</span> is capable of developing resistance against the currently available drugs, understanding the molecular basis of drug resistance, finding new cellular targets, and further understanding the overall mechanism of <span class="match annotated ">C. albicans</span> pathogenesis are important goals. To study this pathogen it is advantageous to manipulate its genome. Numerous strategies of <span class="match annotated ">C. albicans</span> gene manipulation have been introduced. This review evaluates a majority of these strategies and should be a helpful guide for researchers to identify gene targeting strategies to suit their requirements. 
<h3>21820070</h3>Application of the systematic "DAmP" approach to create a partially defective <span class="match annotated ">C. albicans</span> mutant. <br><br>An understanding of gene function often relies upon creating multiple kinds of alleles. Functional analysis in <span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span>, a major <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> pathogen, has generally included characterization of mutant strains with insertion or deletion alleles and over-expression alleles. Here we use in <span class="match annotated ">C. albicans</span> another type of allele that has been employed effectively in the model <span class="annotated ">yeast</span> <span class="annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, a "Decreased Abundance by mRNA Perturbation" (DAmP) allele (Yan et al., 2008). DAmP alleles are created systematically through replacement of 30 noncoding regions with nonfunctional heterologous sequences, and thus are broadly applicable. We used a DAmP allele to probe the function of Sun41, a surface protein with roles in cell wall integrity, cell-cell adherence, hyphal formation, and biofilm formation that has been suggested as a possible therapeutic target (Firon et al., 2007; Hiller et al., 2007; Norice et al., 2007). <span class="unannotated ">A</span> SUN41-DAmP allele results in approximately 10-fold reduced levels of SUN41 RNA, and yields intermediate phenotypes in most assays. We report that a sun41Delta/Delta mutant is defective in biofilm formation in vivo, and that the SUN41-DAmP allele complements that defect. This finding argues that Sun41 may not be an ideal therapeutic target for biofilm inhibition, since a 90% decrease in activity has little effect on biofilm formation in vivo. We anticipate that DAmP alleles of <span class="match unannotated ">C. albicans</span> genes will be informative for analysis of other prospective drug targets, including essential genes. 
<h3>22056521</h3>Accumulation of P-bodies in <span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span> under different stress and filamentous growth conditions. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span> is an opportunistic <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> pathogen that grows as budding <span class="unannotated ">yeast</span>, pseudohyphal, and hyphal forms. In response to external signals, <span class="match annotated ">C. albicans</span> switches rapidly among these forms. mRNA-containing cytoplasmic granules, termed processing bodies (P-bodies), have been reported to accumulate under various environmental stress conditions in diverse species from <span class="annotated ">yeast</span> to mammals. Here, we provide the first microscopic and genetic characterization of P-bodies in <span class="match annotated ">C. albicans</span>. The core components of P-bodies, including the decapping machinery (Dcp2 and Dhh1), 5'-3' exoribonuclease (Kem1/Xrn1), and the P-body scaffolding protein (Edc3), were identified and their localizations with respect to P-bodies were demonstrated. Various growth conditions, including glucose deprivation, hyperosmotic stress, and heat stress, stimulated the accumulation of P-bodies. In addition, we observed P-body aggregation during hyphal development. The deletion mutant strain edc3/edc3 had a defect in filamentation and exhibited a dramatic reduction in the number of P-bodies. These results suggest that Edc3 plays an essential role in the assembly and maintenance of P-bodies in <span class="match annotated ">C. albicans</span>, and that the switch to filamentous growth appears to accompany P-body accumulation. 
<h3>20817114</h3>Activation of the heat shock transcription factor Hsf1 is essential for the full virulence of the <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> pathogen <span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span>. <br><br>The evolutionarily conserved heat shock transcription factor Hsf1 plays a central role in thermal adaptation in the major <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> pathogen of <span class="annotated ">humans</span>, <span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span>. Hsf1 becomes hyperphosphorylated in response to heat shock and activates the transcription of genes with heat shock elements (HSEs) in their promoters, these genes contributing to thermal adaptation. However, the relevance of Hsf1 activation to <span class="match annotated ">C. albicans</span> virulence is not clear as this pathogen is thought to be obligately associated with warm blooded animals, and this issue has not been tested because HSF1 is essential for viability in <span class="match annotated ">C. albicans</span>. In this study, we demonstrate that the HSE regulon is active in <span class="match annotated ">C. albicans</span> cells infecting the kidney. We also show the CE2 region of Hsf1 is required for activation and that the phosphorylation of specific residues in this domain contributes to Hsf1 activation. <span class="match annotated ">C. albicans</span> HSF1 mutants that lack this CE2 region are viable. However, they are unable to activate HSE-containing genes in response to heat shock, and they are thermosensitive. Using this HSF1 CE2 deletion mutant we demonstrate that Hsf1 activation, and hence thermal adaptation, contributes significantly to the virulence of <span class="match annotated ">C. albicans</span>. 
<h3>21511048</h3>The contribution of the S-phase checkpoint genes MEC1 and SGS1 to genome stability maintenance in <span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span>. <br><br>Genome rearrangements, a common feature of <span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span> isolates, are often associated with the acquisition of antifungal drug resistance. In <span class="annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, perturbations in the S-phase checkpoints result in the same sort of Gross Chromosomal Rearrangements (GCRs) observed in <span class="match annotated ">C. albicans</span>. Several proteins are involved in the <span class="annotated ">S. cerevisiae</span> cell cycle checkpoints, including Mec1p, a protein kinase of the PIKK (phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase-like kinase) family and the central player in the DNA damage checkpoint. Sgs1p, the ortholog of BLM, the Bloom's syndrome gene, is a RecQ-related DNA helicase; cells from BLM <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span> are characterized by an increase in genome instability. <span class="annotated ">Yeast</span> strains bearing deletions in MEC1 or SGS1 are viable (in contrast to the inviability seen with loss of MEC1 in <span class="annotated ">S. cerevisiae</span>) but the different deletion mutants have significantly different phenotypes. The mec1Delta/Delta colonies have a wild-type colony morphology, while the sgs1Delta/Delta mutants are slow-growing, producing wrinkled colonies with pseudohyphal-like cells. The mec1Delta/Delta mutants are only sensitive to ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS), methylmethane sulfonate (MMS), and hydroxyurea (HU) but the sgs1Delta/Delta mutants exhibit a high sensitivity to all DNA-damaging agents tested. In an assay for chromosome 1 integrity, the mec1Delta/Delta mutants exhibit an increase in genome instability; no change was observed in the sgs1Delta/Delta mutants. Finally, loss of MEC1 does not affect sensitivity to the antifungal drug fluconazole, while loss of SGS1 leads to an increased susceptibility to fluconazole. Neither deletion elevated the level of antifungal drug resistance acquisition.
