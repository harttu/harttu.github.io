<h2>swine-origin influenza A virus</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21047957</h3>Modification of nonstructural protein 1 of <span class="annotated ">influenza A virus</span> by SUMO1.<br><br>Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is one of the major factors resulting in the efficient infection rate and high level of virulence of <span class="annotated ">influenza A virus</span>. Although consisting of only approximately 230 amino acids, NS1 has the ability to interfere with several systems of the host <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> defense. In the present study, we demonstrate that NS1 of the highly pathogenic avian <span class="annotated ">influenza A/Duck/Hubei/L-1/2004 (H5N1) virus</span> interacts with <span class="annotated ">human</span> Ubc9, which is the E2 conjugating enzyme for sumoylation, and we show that SUMO1 is conjugated to <span class="annotated ">H5N1</span> NS1 in both transfected and infected cells. Furthermore, two lysine residues in the C terminus of NS1 were identified as SUMO1 acceptor sites. When the SUMO1 acceptor sites were removed by mutation, NS1 underwent rapid degradation. Studies of different <span class="annotated ">influenza A virus</span> strains of <span class="annotated ">human</span> and avian origin showed that the majority of <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span> possess an NS1 protein that is modified by SUMO1, except for the recently emerged <span class="match annotated ">swine-origin influenza A virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">S-OIV</span>) (H1N1). Interestingly, growth of a sumoylation-deficient WSN virus mutant was retarded compared to that of wild-type virus. Together, these results indicate that sumoylation enhances NS1 stability and thus promotes rapid growth of <span class="annotated ">influenza A virus</span>.
