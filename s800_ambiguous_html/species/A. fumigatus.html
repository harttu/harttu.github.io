<h2>A. fumigatus</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEAUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20817115</h3>Characterization of the developmental regulator FlbE in <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus fumigatus</span> and <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus nidulans</span>. <br><br>Several upstream developmental activators control asexual development (conidiation) in Aspergillus. In this study, we characterize one of such activators called flbE in <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus fumigatus</span> and <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus nidulans</span>. The predicted FlbE protein is composed of 222 and 201 aa in <span class="match annotated ">A. fumigatus</span> and <span class="annotated ">A. nidulans</span>, respectively. While flbE is transiently expressed during early phase of growth in <span class="annotated ">A. nidulans</span>, it is somewhat constitutively expressed during the lifecycle of <span class="match annotated ">A. fumigatus</span>. The deletion of flbE causes reduced conidiation and delayed expression of brlA and vosA in both species. Moreover, FlbE is necessary for salt-induced development in liquid submerged culture in <span class="match annotated ">A. fumigatus</span>. The <span class="annotated ">A. nidulans</span> flbE null mutation is fully complemented by <span class="match annotated ">A. fumigatus</span> flbE, indicating a functional conservancy of FlbE in Aspergillus. Both the deletion and overexpression of flbE in <span class="annotated ">A. nidulans</span> result in developmental defects, enhanced autolysis, precocious cell death, and delayed expression of brlA/vosA, suggesting that balanced activity of FlbE is crucial for proper growth and development. Importantly, the N-terminal portion of FlbE exhibits the trans-activation ability in <span class="annotated ">yeast</span>, whereas the C-terminal half negatively affects its activity. Site-directed mutagenesis of certain conserved N-terminal amino acids abolishes the ability of trans-activation, overexpression-induced autolysis, and complementing the null mutation. Finally, overexpression of flbD, but not flbB or flbC, restores conidiation in <span class="annotated ">A. nidulans</span> DeltaflbE, generally supporting the current genetic model for developmental regulation. 
<h3>21184840</h3>Functional analysis of the fungal/plant class chitinase family in <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus fumigatus</span>. <br><br>A quintuple mutant was constructed to delete the entire family of the fungal/plant (class III) chitinases of <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus fumigatus</span>. Only a limited reduction in the total chitinolytic activity was seen for the different chitinase mutants including the quintuple mutant. In spite of this reduction in chitinolytic activity, no growth or germination defects were observed in these chitinase mutants. This result demonstrated that the fungal/plant chitinases do not have an essential role in the morphogenesis of <span class="match annotated ">A. fumigatus</span>. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> slight diminution of the growth during autolysis was seen for the quintuple mutant suggesting that class III chitinases may play only a nutritional role during this phase of the cycle, retarding <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> death. 
<h3>21277986</h3>The molecular and genetic basis of conidial pigmentation in <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus niger</span>.<br><br>A characteristic hallmark of <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus niger</span> is the formation of <span class="unannotated ">black</span> conidiospores. We have identified four loci involved in spore pigmentation of <span class="annotated ">A. niger</span> by using a combined genomic and classical complementation approach. First, we characterized a newly isolated color mutant, colA, which lacked pigmentation resulting in white or colorless conidia. Pigmentation of the colA mutant was restored by a gene (An12g03950) which encodes a putative 4'phosphopantetheinyl transferase protein (PptA). 4'Phosphopantetheinyl transferase activity is required for the activation of Polyketide Synthases (PKSs) and/or Non-Ribosomal Peptide Synthases (NRPSs). The loci whose mutation resulted in fawn, olive, and brown color phenotypes were identified by complementation. The fawn phenotype was complemented by a PKS protein (FwnA, An09g05730), the ovlA mutant by An14g05350 (OlvA) and the brnA mutant by An14g05370 (BrnA), the respective homologs of alb1/pksP, ayg1 and abr1 in <span class="match annotated ">A. fumigatus</span>. Targeted disruption of the pptA, fwnA, olvA and brnA genes confirmed the complementation results. Disruption of the pptA gene abolished synthesis of all polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides, while the naphtho-gamma-pyrone subclass of polyketides were specifically dependent on fwnA, and funalenone on fwnA, olvA and brnA. Thus, secondary metabolite profiling of the color mutants revealed a close relationship between polyketide synthesis and conidial pigmentation in <span class="annotated ">A. niger</span>. 
<h3>21840411</h3>The metalloreductase FreB is involved in adaptation of <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus fumigatus</span> to iron starvation. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Aspergillus fumigatus</span> employs two high affinity iron uptake mechanisms, siderophore mediated iron uptake and reductive iron assimilation (RIA). The <span class="match annotated ">A. fumigatus</span> genome encodes 15 putative metalloreductases (MR) but the ferrireductasesinvolved in RIA remained elusive so far. Expression of the MR FreB was found to be transcriptionally repressed by iron via SreA, a repressor of iron acquisition during iron sufficiency, indicating a role in iron metabolism. FreB-inactivation by gene deletion was phenotypically largely inconspicuous unless combined with inactivation of the siderophore system, which then decreased growth rate, surface ferrireductase activity and oxidative stress resistance during iron starvation. This study also revealed that loss of copper-independent siderophore-mediated iron uptake increases sensitivity of <span class="match annotated ">A. fumigatus</span> to copper starvation due to copper-dependence of RIA. 
<h3>21840413</h3>The effects of dsRNA mycoviruses on growth and <span class="linneaus_only ">murine</span> virulence of <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus fumigatus</span>. <br><br>Some isolates of the opportunistic <span class="annotated ">human</span> pathogenic fungus <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus fumigatus</span> are known to be infected with mycoviruses. The dsRNA genomes of two of these mycoviruses, which include a chrysovirus and a partitivirus, have been completely sequenced and an RT-PCR assay for the viruses has been developed. Through curing virus-infected <span class="match annotated ">A. fumigatus</span> isolates by cycloheximide treatment and transfecting virus-free isolates with purified <span class="unannotated ">virus</span>, as checked by RT-PCR, isogenic virus-free and virus-infected lines of the fungus were generated whose phenotypes and growth have been directly compared. Mycovirus infection of <span class="match annotated ">A. fumigatus</span> with either the chrysovirus or the partitivirus resulted in significant aberrant phenotypic alterations and attenuation of growth of the fungus but had no effect on susceptibility to common antifungals. Chrysovirus infection of <span class="match annotated ">A. fumigatus</span> caused no significant alterations to <span class="linneaus_only ">murine</span> pathogenicity. 
<h3>21907818</h3>The structure-function relationship of the <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus fumigatuscyp51A</span> L98H conversion by site-directed mutagenesis: the mechanism of L98H azole resistance. <br><br>Since 1998, the rapid emergence of multi-azole-resistance (MAR) was observed in <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus fumigatus</span> in the Netherlands. Two dominant mutations were found in the cyp51A gene, a 34bp tandem repeat (TR) in the promoter region combined with a leucine to histidine substitution at codon 98 (L98H). In this study, we show that molecular dynamics simulations combined with site-directed mutagenesis of amino acid substitutions in the cyp51A gene, correlate to the structure-function relationship of the L98H substitution conferring to MAR in <span class="match annotated ">A. fumigatus</span>. Because of a L98H directed change in the flexibility of the loops, that comprise a gate-like structure in the protein, the capacity of the two ligand entry channels is modified by narrowing the diameter and thereby binding of azoles is obstructed. Moreover, the L98H induced relocation of tyrosine 121 and tyrosine 107 seems to be related to the MAR phenotype, without affecting the biological activity of the CYP51A protein. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that both the 34bp TR and the L98H mutation are required to obtain the MAR phenotype. Furthermore, the amino acid leucine in codon 98 in <span class="match annotated ">A. fumigatus</span> is highly conserved and important for maintaining the structure of the CYP51A protein that is essential for azole docking.
