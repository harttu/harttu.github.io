<h2>Candida krusei</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21272794</h3>Emerging opportunistic <span class="unannotated ">yeast</span> infections.<br><br>A growing population of immunosuppressed <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> has resulted in increasingly frequent diagnoses of invasive <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> infections, including those caused by unusual <span class="unannotated ">yeasts</span>. The incidence of non-albicans species of Candida is increasing compared with that of <span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span>, and several species, such as <span class="annotated ">Candida glabrata</span> and <span class="match annotated ">Candida krusei</span>, may be resistant to azole antifungal therapy. Trichosporon species are the second most common cause of fungaemia in <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> with haematological malignant disease and are characterised by resistance to amphotericin and echinocandins and poor prognosis. Rhodotorula species belong to the family Cryptococcaceae, and are a cause of catheter-related fungaemia, sepsis, and invasive disease in severely immunosuppressed <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span>. An increasing number of sporadic cases of invasive <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> infections by non-neoformans cryptococci have been reported in immunocompromised hosts, especially for <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> with advanced <span class="annotated ">HIV</span> infection or cancer who are undergoing transplant. Other uncommon <span class="unannotated ">yeasts</span> that can cause invasive disease in severely immunosuppressed <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> include Geotrichum, Hansenula, Malassezia, and Saccharomyces. Host immune status is a crucial determinant of the type of invasive <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> infection a <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patient</span> is at risk for. Diagnosis can be challenging and relies heavily on traditional cultures of blood and other sterile sites, although serum (1,3)-Beta-D-glucan testing might have an adjunctive role. Although rare <span class="unannotated ">yeasts</span> are emerging as opportunistic <span class="annotated ">human</span> pathogens, diagnosis remains challenging and treatment suboptimal.
