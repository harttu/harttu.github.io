<h2>child</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21227494</h3>Reproductive health, and <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">child</span> health and nutrition in India: meeting the challenge. <br><br>India, with a population of more than 1 billion <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">people</span>, has many challenges in improving the health and nutrition of its citizens. Steady declines have been noted in fertility, maternal, <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">infant</span> and <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">child</span> mortalities, and the prevalence of severe manifestations of nutritional deficiencies, but the pace has been slow and falls short of national and Millennium Development Goal targets. The likely explanations include social inequities, disparities in health systems between and within states, and consequences of urbanisation and demographic transition. In 2005, India embarked on the National Rural Health Mission, an extraordinary effort to strengthen the health systems. However, coverage of priority interventions remains insufficient, and the content and quality of existing interventions are suboptimum. Substantial unmet need for contraception remains, adolescent pregnancies are common, and access to safe abortion is inadequate. Increases in the numbers of deliveries in institutions have not been matched by improvements in the quality of intrapartum and neonatal care. Infants and young <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">children</span> do not get the health care they need; access to effective treatment for neonatal illness, diarrhoea, and pneumonia shows little improvement; and the coverage of nutrition programmes is inadequate. Absence of well functioning health systems is indicated by the inadequacies related to planning, financing, <span class="annotated ">human</span> resources, infrastructure, supply systems, governance, information, and monitoring. We provide a case for transformation of health systems through effective stewardship, decentralised planning in districts, a reasoned approach to financing that affects demand for health care, a campaign to create awareness and change health and nutrition behaviour, and revision of programmes for <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">child</span> nutrition on the basis of evidence. This agenda needs political commitment of the highest order and the development of a people's movement. 
<h3>21496911</h3>Stillbirths: Where? When? Why? How to make the data count?<br><br>Despite increasing attention and investment for maternal, neonatal, and <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">child</span> health, stillbirths remain invisible-not counted in the Millennium Development Goals, nor tracked by the UN, nor in the Global Burden of Disease metrics. At least 2*65 million stillbirths (uncertainty range 2*08 million to 3*79 million) were estimated worldwide in 2008 (>=1000 g birthweight or >=28 weeks of gestation). 98% of stillbirths occur in low-income and middle-income countries, and numbers vary from 2*0 per 1000 total births in Finland to more than 40 per 1000 total births in Nigeria and Pakistan. Worldwide, 67% of stillbirths occur in rural families, 55% in rural sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, where skilled birth attendance and caesarean sections are much lower than that for urban births. In total, an estimated 1*19 million (range 0*82 million to 1*97 million) intrapartum stillbirths occur yearly. Most intrapartum stillbirths are associated with obstetric emergencies, whereas antepartum stillbirths are associated with maternal infections and fetal growth restriction. National estimates of causes of stillbirths are scarce, and multiple (>35) classification systems impede international comparison. Immediate data improvements are feasible through household surveys and facility audit, and improvements in vital registration, including specific perinatal certificates and revised International Classification of Disease codes, are needed. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> simple, programme-relevant stillbirth classification that can be used with verbal autopsy would provide a basis for comparable national estimates. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> new focus on all deaths around the time of birth is crucial to inform programmatic investment. 
<h3>21269675</h3>Maternal, neonatal, and <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">child</span> health in southeast Asia: towards greater regional collaboration. <br><br>Although maternal and <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">child</span> mortality are on the decline in southeast Asia, there are still major disparities, and greater equity is key to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. We used comparable cross-national data sources to document mortality trends from 1990 to 2008 and to assess major causes of maternal and <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">child</span> deaths. We present inequalities in intervention coverage by two common measures of wealth quintiles and rural or urban status. Case studies of reduction in mortality in Thailand and Indonesia indicate the varying extents of success and point to some factors that accelerate progress. We developed a Lives Saved Tool analysis for the region and for country subgroups to estimate deaths averted by cause and intervention. We identified three major patterns of maternal and <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">child</span> mortality reduction: early, rapid downward trends (Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand); initially high declines (sustained by Vietnam but faltering in the Philippines and Indonesia); and high initial rates with a downward trend (Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar). Economic development seems to provide an important context that should be coupled with broader health-system interventions. Increasing coverage and consideration of the health-system context is needed, and regional support from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations can provide increased policy support to achieve maternal, neonatal, and <span class="match LINNAEUS_only ">child</span> health goals.
