<h2>S. cerevisiae</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEAUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21281727</h3>Identification and characterization of putative osmosensors, HwSho1A and HwSho1B, from the extremely halotolerant <span class="unannotated ">black</span> <span class="unannotated ">yeast</span> <span class="annotated ">Hortaea werneckii</span>. <br><br>In <span class="annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, the Sho1 protein is one of two potential osmosensors that can activate the kinase cascade of the HOG pathway in response to increased extracellular osmolarity. Two novel SHO1-like genes, HwSHO1A and HwSHO1B, have been cloned from the saltern-inhabiting, extremely halotolerant <span class="unannotated ">black</span> <span class="unannotated ">yeast</span> <span class="annotated ">Hortaea werneckii</span>. The HwSho1 protein isoforms are 93.8% identical in their amino-acid sequences, and have a conserved SH3 domain. When the HwSHO1 genes were transferred into <span class="annotated ">S. cerevisae</span> cells lacking the SHO1 gene, both of the HwSho1 isoforms fully complemented the function of the native <span class="match annotated ">S. cerevisiae</span> Sho1 protein. Through microscopic and biochemical validation, we demonstrate that in <span class="match annotated ">S. cerevisiae</span>, both of the HwSho1 proteins have characteristic subcellular localizations similar to the <span class="match annotated ">S. cerevisiae</span> Sho1 protein, and they can both activate the HOG pathway under conditions of osmotic stress. To a lower extent, crosstalk to the mating pathway expressing HwSho1 proteins is conserved in the PBS2 deleted <span class="match annotated ">S. cerevisiae</span> strain. These data show that the HwSho1 proteins from <span class="annotated ">H. werneckii</span> are true functional homologs of the Sho1 protein of <span class="match annotated ">S. cerevisiae</span>. 
<h3>21362491</h3>Fluorescent proteins illuminate the structure and function of the hyphal tip apparatus. <br><br>Fungal hyphae show extreme polarized growth at the tip. Electron microscope studies have revealed a apical body called the Spitzenkorper that is thought to drive polarized growth. Studies of polarized growth in <span class="match annotated ">S. cerevisiae</span> have identified the protein components of the polarized growth machinery, that are conserved in other fungi. Fusion of these proteins to GFP and its variants has for the first time allowed the localization of these proteins in real time to the hyphal tip without the need for drastic fixation procedures. Such studies showed that vesicle-associated proteins localize to the Spitzenkorper and identified a second compartment located at the tip surface composed of exocyst and other proteins that mediate the fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane. 
<h3>21801845</h3>The transcriptional response of <span class="annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> to proapoptotic concentrations of <span class="annotated ">Pichia membranifaciens</span> killer toxin. <br><br>PMKT (<span class="annotated ">Pichia membranifaciens</span> killer toxin) reportedly has antimicrobial activity against <span class="annotated ">yeasts</span> and filamentous fungi. In previous research we posited that high PMKT concentrations pose a serious challenge for cell survival by disrupting plasma membrane electrochemical gradients, inducing a transcriptional response similar to that of certain stimuli such as hyperosmotic shock. This response was related to the HOG-pathway with Hog1p phosphorylation and a transitional increase in intracellular glycerol accumulation. Such a response was consistent with the notion that the effect induced by high PMKT concentrations lies in an alteration to the ionic homeostasis of the sensitive cell. By contrast, the evidence presented here shows that low PMKT doses lead to a cell death process in <span class="annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> accompanied by cytological and biochemical indicators of apoptotic programmed cell death, namely, the production of reactive oxygen species, DNA strand breaks, metacaspase activation and cytochrome c release. Furthermore, dying cells progressed from an apoptotic state to a secondary necrotic state, and the rate at which this change occurred was proportional to the intensity of the stimulus. We have explored the global gene expression response of <span class="match annotated ">S. cerevisiae</span> during that stimulus. The results obtained from DNA microarrays indicate that genes related with an oxidative stress response were induced in response to proapoptotic concentrations of PMKT, showing that the coordinated transcriptional response is not coincident with that obtained when ionophoric concentrations of PMKT are used. By contrast, cwp2Delta mutants showed no signs of apoptosis, indicating that the initial steps of the killer mechanism coincide when proapoptotic (low) or ionophoric (high) PMKT concentrations are used. Additionally, low dosages of PMKT promoted Hog1p phosphorylation and glycerol accumulation. 
<h3>20817000</h3>Amino acid divergence between the CHS domain contributes to the different intracellular behaviour of Family II <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> chitin synthases in <span class="annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>. <br><br>Family II chitin synthases (CS), including classes IV and V enzymes, share conserved catalytic domains flanked by transmembrane regions. Here we addressed the characterization of Family II <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> CSs by heterologous expression in <span class="annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>. Full-length CSs from classes V or IV were not functional when expressed in <span class="match annotated ">S. cerevisiae</span> and accumulated in different intracellular compartments. However, the exchange between different class IV, but not of class V, CHS domains resulted in functional proteins both in vivo and in vitro. The different domains afford the chimeric proteins distinct intracellular behaviours, ranging from endoplasmic reticulum retention to reduced endocytic turnover at the plasma membrane. These results allow a role in chitin synthesis to be assigned to all class IV enzymes, but they also highlight the involvement of the intracellular globular domain of these CSs, not only in enzymatic activity but also in the regulation of their intracellular turnover. 
<h3>21511048</h3>The contribution of the S-phase checkpoint genes MEC1 and SGS1 to genome stability maintenance in <span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span>. <br><br>Genome rearrangements, a common feature of <span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span> isolates, are often associated with the acquisition of antifungal drug resistance. In <span class="annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, perturbations in the S-phase checkpoints result in the same sort of Gross Chromosomal Rearrangements (GCRs) observed in <span class="annotated ">C. albicans</span>. Several proteins are involved in the <span class="match annotated ">S. cerevisiae</span> cell cycle checkpoints, including Mec1p, a protein kinase of the PIKK (phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase-like kinase) family and the central player in the DNA damage checkpoint. Sgs1p, the ortholog of BLM, the Bloom's syndrome gene, is a RecQ-related DNA helicase; cells from BLM <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span> are characterized by an increase in genome instability. <span class="annotated ">Yeast</span> strains bearing deletions in MEC1 or SGS1 are viable (in contrast to the inviability seen with loss of MEC1 in <span class="match annotated ">S. cerevisiae</span>) but the different deletion mutants have significantly different phenotypes. The mec1Delta/Delta colonies have a wild-type colony morphology, while the sgs1Delta/Delta mutants are slow-growing, producing wrinkled colonies with pseudohyphal-like cells. The mec1Delta/Delta mutants are only sensitive to ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS), methylmethane sulfonate (MMS), and hydroxyurea (HU) but the sgs1Delta/Delta mutants exhibit a high sensitivity to all DNA-damaging agents tested. In an assay for chromosome 1 integrity, the mec1Delta/Delta mutants exhibit an increase in genome instability; no change was observed in the sgs1Delta/Delta mutants. Finally, loss of MEC1 does not affect sensitivity to the antifungal drug fluconazole, while loss of SGS1 leads to an increased susceptibility to fluconazole. Neither deletion elevated the level of antifungal drug resistance acquisition.
