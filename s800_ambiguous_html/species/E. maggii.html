<h2>E. maggii</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21641778</h3>Suitability of different media for in vitro cultivation of the ruminal protozoa species <span class="annotated ">Entodinium caudatum</span>, <span class="annotated ">Eudiplodinium maggii</span>, and <span class="annotated ">Epidinium ecaudatum</span>. <br><br>Three protozoal cultivation media were tested to determine the medium which best facilitated growth and viability of key B-type ciliates isolated from the <span class="unannotated ">sheep</span> rumen. <span class="annotated ">Entodinium caudatum</span> and <span class="annotated ">Eudiplodinium maggii</span> were grown anaerobically in 50-ml flasks for 32 days in Caudatum-type (C), Kisidayova (K) or Dehority (M) medium. On day 32, in media K and M, <span class="annotated ">E. caudatum</span> cell counts were high with 5.6x10(3) and 7.8x10(3) mL(-1), respectively, and the proportion of dead cells was low with 0.6 and 1.4%, respectively. <span class="match annotated ">E. maggii</span> concentrations when grown in medium M and C were 2.7x10(3) and 2.4x10(3) mL(-1), respectively, with 3.9 and 14.1% dead cells. Medium M, which favoured growth of both protozoa species, was tested again and <span class="annotated ">Epidinium ecaudatum</span> was included. Protozoa were grown for a 4-month period and samples were taken in the last two months on days 1, 7, 35 and 57. Average cell concentrations were 10.0, 0.8 and 0.5x10(3) mL(-1) for <span class="annotated ">E. caudatum</span>, <span class="match annotated ">E. maggii</span>, and <span class="annotated ">E. ecaudatum</span>, respectively. In conclusion, medium M would appear to be the best choice for cultivating these three species in one medium.
