<h2>mice</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20943971</h3>Roles of <span class="annotated ">vaccinia virus</span> genes E3L and K3L and host genes PKR and RNase L during intratracheal infection of C57BL/6 <span class="match annotated ">mice</span>. <br><br>The importance of the 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/RNase L and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR) pathways in host interferon induction resulting from virus infection in response to dsRNA has been well documented. In poxvirus infections, the interactions between the <span class="annotated ">vaccinia virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">VV</span>) genes E3L and K3L, which target RNase L and PKR, respectively, serve to prevent the induction of the dsRNA-dependent induced interferon response in cell culture. To determine the importance of these host genes in controlling <span class="annotated ">VV</span> infections, <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> single-gene knockouts of RNase L and PKR and double-knockout <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> were studied following intratracheal infection with <span class="annotated ">VV</span>, VVDeltaK3L, or VVDeltaE3L. <span class="annotated ">VV</span> caused lethal disease in all <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> strains. The single-knockout animals were more susceptible than wild-type animals, while the RNase L(-/-) PKR(-/-) <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> were the most susceptible. VVDeltaE3L infections of wild-type <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> were asymptomatic, demonstrating that E3L plays a critical role in controlling the host immune response. RNase L(-/-) <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> showed no disease, whereas 20% of the PKR(-/-) <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> succumbed at a dose of 10(8) PFU. Lethal disease was routinely observed in RNase L(-/-) PKR(-/-) <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> inoculated with 10(8) PFU of VVDeltaE3L, with a distinct pathology. VVDeltaK3L infections exhibited no differences in virulence among any of the <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> constructs, suggesting that PKR is not the exclusive target of K3L. Surprisingly, VVDeltaK3L did not disseminate to other tissues from the lung. Hence, the cause of death in this model is respiratory disease. These results also suggest that an unanticipated role of the K3L gene is to facilitate virus dissemination. 
<h3>20962084</h3>Modifications in the polymerase genes of a swine-like triple-reassortant <span class="unannotated ">influenza virus</span> to generate live attenuated vaccines against 2009 pandemic <span class="annotated ">H1N1 viruses</span>. <br><br>On 11 June 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the outbreaks caused by novel <span class="annotated ">swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus</span> had reached pandemic proportions. The pandemic <span class="annotated ">H1N1 (H1N1pdm) virus</span> is the predominant <span class="unannotated ">influenza virus</span> strain in the <span class="annotated ">human</span> population. It has also crossed the species barriers and infected <span class="annotated ">turkeys</span> and <span class="annotated ">swine</span> in several countries. Thus, the development of a vaccine that is effective in multiple animal species is urgently needed. We have previously demonstrated that the introduction of temperature-sensitive mutations into the PB2 and PB1 genes of an avian <span class="annotated ">H9N2 virus</span>, combined with the insertion of a hemagglutinin (HA) tag in PB1, resulted in an attenuated (att) vaccine backbone for both <span class="annotated ">chickens</span> and <span class="match annotated ">mice</span>. Because the new pandemic strain is a triple-reassortant (TR) virus, we chose to introduce the double attenuating modifications into a <span class="annotated ">swine</span>-like TR virus isolate, <span class="annotated ">A/turkey/OH/313053/04 (H3N2)</span> (ty/04), with the goal of producing live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV). This genetically modified backbone had impaired polymerase activity and restricted virus growth at elevated temperatures. In vivo characterization of two <span class="annotated ">H1N1</span> vaccine candidates generated using the ty/04 att backbone demonstrated that this vaccine is highly attenuated in <span class="match annotated ">mice</span>, as indicated by the absence of signs of disease, limited replication, and minimum histopathological alterations in the respiratory tract. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> single immunization with the ty/04 att-based vaccines conferred complete protection against a lethal <span class="annotated ">H1N1pdm virus</span> infection in <span class="match annotated ">mice</span>. More importantly, vaccination of <span class="annotated ">pigs</span> with a ty/04 att-<span class="annotated ">H1N1</span> vaccine candidate resulted in sterilizing immunity upon an aggressive intratracheal challenge with the 2009 <span class="annotated ">H1N1</span> pandemic virus. Our studies highlight the safety of the ty/04 att vaccine platform and its potential as a master donor strain for the generation of live attenuated vaccines for <span class="annotated ">humans</span> and livestock. 
<h3>20962087</h3>The magnitude of local immunity in the lungs of <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> induced by live attenuated influenza vaccines is determined by local <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> replication and induction of cytokines. <br><br>While live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) have been shown to be efficacious and have been licensed for <span class="annotated ">human</span> use, the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) have to be updated for optimal protective efficacy. Little is known about the effect of different HA and NA proteins on the immunogenicity of LAIVs developed using the same backbone. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> panel of LAIVs that share the internal protein genes, with unique HA and NA gene segments from different influenza subtypes, was rescued by reverse genetics, and a comparative study of immune responses induced by these vaccines was conducted in <span class="match annotated ">mice</span>. The results suggest that the magnitude of lung immunity, including pulmonary IgA antibody and memory CD8(+) T lymphocytes, induced by the vaccines depends on the replication efficiency of the LAIVs, as well as the induction of cytokines/chemokines in the lungs. However, these factors are not important in determining systemic immunity such as serum antibody titers and memory CD8(+) T cells in the spleen. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> qualitative analysis of immune responses induced by a single dose of an <span class="annotated ">H5N1</span> LAIV revealed that the vaccine induced robust systemic and mucosal immunity in <span class="match annotated ">mice</span>. In addition, antibodies and memory lymphocytes established in the lungs following vaccination were required for protection against lethal challenge with homologous and heterologous <span class="annotated ">H5N1 viruses</span>. Our results highlight the different requirements for inducing systemic and lung immunity that can be explored for the development of pulmonary immunity for protection against respiratory pathogens. 
<h3>20962088</h3>Multiple innate immune pathways contribute to the immunogenicity of recombinant <span class="unannotated ">adenovirus</span> vaccine vectors. <br><br>The innate immune pathways that contribute to the potent immunogenicity of recombinant <span class="unannotated ">adenovirus</span> (rAd) vaccine vectors remain largely undefined. Previous studies assessing innate immunity triggered by vaccine vectors have largely focused on in vitro studies involving antigen-presenting cells and on early in vivo inflammatory responses. Here, we systematically explore the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling requirements for the generation of cellular immune responses by intramuscular immunization with common and alternative <span class="unannotated ">serotype</span> rAd vectors in <span class="match annotated ">mice</span>. Antigen-specific CD8(+) T-lymphocyte responses elicited by these rAd vectors were significantly diminished in MyD88(-/-) <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> but not in TRIF(-/-) or TLR3(-/-) <span class="match annotated ">mice</span>, suggesting the importance of MyD88-dependent TLR signaling. However, the absence of each individual TLR resulted in minimal to no effect on vaccine-elicited cellular immune responses. Moreover, responses were not diminished in IL-1R(-/-) or IL-18R(-/-) <span class="match annotated ">mice</span>. These data suggest that rAd vectors engage multiple MyD88-dependent signaling pathways, none of which are individually critical; rather, they are integrated to contribute to the potent immunogenicity of rAd vectors. Stimulation of multiple innate immune mechanisms may prove a generalizable property of potent vaccines, and this strategy could be harnessed in the development of next-generation vaccine vectors and adjuvants. 
<h3>20980504</h3>Function of the small hydrophobic protein of J paramyxovirus.<br><br>At 18,954 nucleotides, the J paramyxovirus (JPV) genome is one of the largest in the family Paramyxoviridae, consisting of eight genes in the order 3'-N-P/V/C-M-F-SH-TM-G-L-5'. To study the function of novel paramyxovirus genes in JPV, a plasmid containing a full-length cDNA clone of the genome of JPV was constructed. In this study, the function of the small hydrophobic (SH) protein of JPV was examined by generating a recombinant JPV lacking the coding sequence of the SH protein (rJPVDeltaSH). rJPVDeltaSH was viable and had no growth defect in tissue culture cells. However, more tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) was produced during rJPVDeltaSH infection, suggesting that SH plays a role in inhibiting TNF-alpha production. rJPVDeltaSH induced more apoptosis in tissue culture cells than rJPV. Virus-induced apoptosis was inhibited by neutralizing antibody against TNF-alpha, suggesting that TNF-alpha contributes to JPV-induced apoptosis in vitro. The expression of JPV SH protein inhibited TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation in a reporter gene assay, suggesting that JPV SH protein can inhibit TNF-alpha signaling in vitro. Furthermore, infection of <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> with rJPVDeltaSH induced more TNF-alpha expression, indicating that SH plays a role in blocking TNF-alpha expression in vivo. 
<h3>20980507</h3>Successful vaccination strategies that protect aged <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> from lethal challenge from <span class="annotated ">influenza virus</span> and heterologous <span class="annotated ">severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus</span>. <br><br>Newly emerging <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span> often circulate as a heterogeneous swarm in wild animal reservoirs prior to their emergence in <span class="annotated ">humans</span>, and their antigenic identities are often unknown until an outbreak situation. The newly emerging <span class="annotated ">severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus</span> (<span class="annotated ">SARS-CoV</span>) and reemerging <span class="annotated ">influenza virus</span> cause disproportionate disease in the aged, who are also notoriously difficult to successfully vaccinate, likely due to immunosenescence. To protect against future emerging strains, vaccine platforms should induce broad cross-reactive immunity that is sufficient to protect from homologous and heterologous challenge in all ages. From initial studies, we hypothesized that attenuated <span class="annotated ">Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">VEE</span>) replicon particle (VRP) vaccine glycoproteins mediated vaccine failure in the aged. We then compared the efficacies of vaccines bearing attenuated (VRP(3014)) or wild-type <span class="annotated ">VEE</span> glycoproteins (VRP(3000)) in young and aged <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> within novel models of severe <span class="annotated ">SARS-CoV</span> pathogenesis. Aged animals receiving VRP(3000)-based vaccines were protected from <span class="annotated ">SARS-CoV</span> disease, while animals receiving the VRP(3014)-based vaccines were not. The superior protection for the aged observed with VRP(3000)-based vaccines was confirmed in a lethal <span class="annotated ">influenza virus</span> challenge model. While the VRP(3000) vaccine's immune responses in the aged were sufficient to protect against lethal homologous and heterologous challenge, our data suggest that innate defects within the VRP(3014) platform mediate vaccine failure. Exploration into the mechanism(s) of successful vaccination in the immunosenescent should aid in the development of successful vaccine strategies for other <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> diseases disproportionately affecting the elderly, like <span class="annotated ">West Nile virus</span>, <span class="annotated ">influenza virus</span>, norovirus, or other emerging <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span> of the future. 
<h3>20980510</h3>Assembly and immunological properties of <span class="annotated ">Newcastle disease virus</span>-like particles containing the <span class="annotated ">respiratory syncytial virus</span> F and G proteins. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Human respiratory syncytial virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">RSV</span>) is a serious respiratory pathogen in <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">infants</span> and young <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">children</span> as well as elderly and immunocompromised populations. However, no <span class="annotated ">RSV</span> vaccines are available. We have explored the potential of virus-like particles (VLPs) as an <span class="annotated ">RSV</span> vaccine candidate. VLPs composed entirely of <span class="annotated ">RSV</span> proteins were produced at levels inadequate for their preparation as immunogens. However, VLPs composed of the <span class="annotated ">Newcastle disease virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">NDV</span>) nucleocapsid and membrane proteins and chimera proteins containing the ectodomains of <span class="annotated ">RSV</span> F and G proteins fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of <span class="annotated ">NDV</span> F and HN proteins, respectively, were quantitatively prepared from avian cells. Immunization of <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> with these VLPs, without adjuvant, stimulated robust, anti-RSV F and G protein antibody responses. IgG2a/IgG1 ratios were very high, suggesting predominantly T(H)1 responses. In contrast to infectious <span class="annotated ">RSV</span> immunization, neutralization antibody titers were robust and stable for 4 months. Immunization with a single dose of VLPs resulted in the complete protection of <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> from <span class="annotated ">RSV</span> replication in lungs. Upon <span class="annotated ">RSV</span> intranasal challenge of VLP-immunized <span class="match annotated ">mice</span>, no enhanced lung pathology was observed, in contrast to the pathology observed in <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> immunized with formalin-inactivated <span class="annotated ">RSV</span>. These results suggest that these VLPs are effective <span class="annotated ">RSV</span> vaccines in <span class="match annotated ">mice</span>, in contrast to other nonreplicating <span class="annotated ">RSV</span> vaccine candidates. 
<h3>20980520</h3>Persistent <span class="annotated ">Friend virus</span> replication and disease in Apobec3-deficient <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> expressing functional B-cell-activating factor receptor. <br><br>Rfv3 is an autosomal dominant gene that influences the recovery of resistant <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> from <span class="annotated ">Friend retrovirus</span> (<span class="annotated ">FV</span>) infection by limiting viremia and promoting a more potent neutralizing antibody response. We previously reported that Rfv3 is encoded by Apobec3, an innate retrovirus restriction factor. However, it was recently suggested that the Rfv3 susceptible phenotype of high viremia at 28 days postinfection (dpi) was more dominantly controlled by the B-cell-activating factor receptor (BAFF-R), a gene that is linked to but located outside the genetically mapped region containing Rfv3. Although one prototypical Rfv3 susceptible <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> strain, A/WySn, indeed contains a dysfunctional BAFF-R, two other Rfv3 susceptible strains, BALB/c and <span class="unannotated ">A</span>.BY, express functional BAFF-R genes, determined on the basis of genotyping and B-cell immunophenotyping. Furthermore, transcomplementation studies in (C57BL/6 [B6] x BALB/c)F(1) and (B6 x <span class="unannotated ">A</span>.BY)F(1) <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> revealed that the B6 Apobec3 gene significantly influences recovery from <span class="annotated ">FV</span> viremia, cellular infection, and disease at 28 dpi. Finally, the Rfv3 phenotypes of prototypic B6, <span class="unannotated ">A</span>.BY, A/WySn, and BALB/c <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> strains correlate with reported Apobec3 mRNA expression levels. Overall, these findings argue against the generality of BAFF-R polymorphisms as a dominant mechanism to explain the Rfv3 recovery phenotype and further strengthen the evidence that Apobec3 encodes Rfv3. 
<h3>20980523</h3>T cell-mediated protection against lethal 2009 pandemic <span class="annotated ">H1N1 influenza virus</span> infection in a <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> model. <br><br>Genetic mutation and reassortment of <span class="annotated ">influenza virus</span> gene segments, in particular those of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), that lead to antigenic drift and shift are the major strategies for <span class="annotated ">influenza virus</span> to escape preexisting immunity. The most recent example of such phenomena is the first pandemic of <span class="annotated ">H1N1 influenza</span> of the 21st century, which started in 2009. Cross-reactive antibodies raised against <span class="annotated ">H1N1 viruses</span> circulating before 1930 show protective activity against the 2009 pandemic virus. Cross-reactive T-cell responses can also contribute to protection, but in vivo support of this view is lacking. To explore the protection mechanisms in vivo, we primed <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> with <span class="annotated ">H1</span> and <span class="annotated ">H3 influenza virus</span> isolates and rechallenged them with a virus derived from the 2009 <span class="annotated ">H1N1 A/CA/04/09 virus</span>, named CA/E3/09. We found that priming with <span class="annotated ">influenza viruses</span> of both <span class="annotated ">H1</span> and <span class="annotated ">H3</span> homo- and heterosubtypes protected against lethal CA/E3/09 virus challenge. Convalescent-phase sera from these primed <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> conferred no neutralization activity in vitro and no protection in vivo. However, T-cell depletion studies suggested that both CD4 and CD8 T cells contributed to the protection. Taken together, these results indicate that cross-reactive T cells established after initial priming with distally related <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span> can be a vital component for prevention of disease and control of pandemic <span class="annotated ">H1N1 influenza virus</span> infection. Our results highlight the importance of establishing cross-reactive T-cell responses for protecting against existing or newly emerging pandemic <span class="annotated ">influenza viruses</span>. 
<h3>21907298</h3><span class="annotated ">Galleria mellonella</span> as model host for the trans-kingdom pathogen <span class="annotated ">Fusarium oxysporum</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Fusarium oxysporum</span>, the causal agent of vascular wilt disease, affects a wide range of plant species and can produce disseminated infections in <span class="annotated ">humans</span>. <span class="annotated ">F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici isolate FGSC 9935</span> causes disease both on <span class="annotated ">tomato</span> plants and immunodepressed <span class="match annotated ">mice</span>, making it an ideal model for the comparative analysis of fungal virulence on plant and animal hosts. Here we tested the ability of <span class="annotated ">FGSC 9935</span> to cause disease in the <span class="annotated ">greater wax moth</span> <span class="annotated ">Galleria mellonella</span>, an invertebrate model host that is widely used for the study of microbial <span class="annotated ">human</span> pathogens. Injection of living but not of heat-killed microconidia into the hemocoel of <span class="annotated ">G. mellonella</span> larvae resulted in dose-dependent killing both at 30^0C and at 37^0C. Fluorescence microscopy of larvae inoculated with a <span class="annotated ">F. oxysporum</span> transformant expressing GFP revealed hyphal proliferation within the hemocoel, interaction with <span class="annotated ">G. mellonella</span> hemocytes, and colonization of the killed insects by the fungus. Fungal gene knockout mutants previously tested in the <span class="annotated ">tomato</span> and immunodepressed <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> systems displayed a good correlation in virulence between the Galleria and the <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> model. Thus, Galleria represents a useful non-vertebrate infection model for studying virulence mechanisms of <span class="annotated ">F. oxysporum</span> on animal hosts. 
<h3>20796206</h3>Linking disease and community ecology through behavioural indicators: immunochallenge of <span class="annotated ">white-footed mice</span> and its ecological impacts. <br><br>1. Pathogens and immune challenges can induce changes in host phenotype in ways that indirectly impact important community interactions, including those that affect host-pathogen interactions. 2. To explore host behavioural response to immune challenge, we exposed wild <span class="annotated ">white-footed mice</span> (<span class="annotated ">Peromyscus leucopus</span>) to an immunogen from an endemic, zoonotic pathogen, the spirochete <span class="annotated ">Borrelia burgdorferi</span>. <span class="annotated ">White-footed mice</span> are a major reservoir host of Lyme disease (LD) spirochetes in northeastern USA and an abundant member of forest communities. The activity patterns, foraging behaviour, and space use of <span class="annotated ">white-footed mice</span> have implications for population growth rates of community members upon which <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> incidentally prey (i.e. <span class="annotated ">gypsy moths</span> and native thrushes), as well as potentially determining host-vector encounter rates and <span class="annotated ">human</span> risk of LD. 3. Immunochallenge led to specific humoral (antibody) and cellular (i.e. elevated neutrophils and eosinophils) immune responses, supporting use of the immunogen as a surrogate for pathogenic infection. 4. Immunochallenged <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> had reduced wheel-running activity early in the night when measured in the lab. However, <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> activity, as measured by track plates in natural field experiments, did not differ between <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> exposed to the immunogen and unexposed <span class="match annotated ">mice</span>. 5. Foraging behaviour of wild <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> in the field - assessed with giving-up densities of seed at artificial feeding stations - was affected by exposure to the immunogen. Whereas immunochallenge did not influence whether foraging <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> gained information on patch quality while foraging, it led to reductions in predator avoidance during foraging, suggesting that the proportion of space used by foraging <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> may be greater as a result of immunochallenge. This increased space use is predicted to increase encounter rates with patchily distributed LD vectors (ticks) and with incidental prey items. 6. Thus, immunochallenge in <span class="annotated ">white-footed mice</span>, and potentially pathogenic infection, have the potential to indirectly impact community interactions, including those important for pathogen transmission. 
<h3>20962098</h3>PB2 residue 158 is a pathogenic determinant of pandemic <span class="annotated ">H1N1</span> and <span class="annotated ">H5 influenza a viruses</span> in <span class="match annotated ">mice</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Influenza A viruses</span> are <span class="annotated ">human</span> and animal pathogens that cause morbidity and mortality, which range from mild to severe. The 2009 <span class="annotated ">H1N1</span> pandemic was caused by the emergence of a reassortant <span class="annotated ">H1N1</span> subtype (<span class="annotated ">H1N1pdm</span>) <span class="annotated ">influenza A virus</span> containing gene segments that originally circulated in <span class="annotated ">human</span>, avian, and <span class="annotated ">swine</span> virus reservoirs. The molecular determinants of replication and pathogenesis of <span class="annotated ">H1N1pdm viruses</span> in <span class="annotated ">humans</span> and other mammals are poorly understood. Therefore, we set out to elucidate <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> determinants critical to the pathogenesis of this novel reassortant using a <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> model. We found that a glutamate-to-glycine substitution at residue 158 of the PB2 gene (PB2-E158G) increased the morbidity and mortality of the parental <span class="annotated ">H1N1pdm virus</span>. Results from mini-genome replication assays in <span class="annotated ">human</span> cells and virus titration in <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> tissues demonstrated that PB2-E158G is a pathogenic determinant, because it significantly increases <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> replication rates. The virus load in PB2-E158G-infected <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> lungs was 1,300-fold higher than that of the wild-type virus. Our data also show that PB2-E158G had a much stronger influence on the RNA replication and pathogenesis of <span class="annotated ">H1N1pdm viruses</span> than PB2-E627K, which is a known pathogenic determinant. Remarkably, PB2-E158G substitutions also altered the pathotypes of two avian <span class="annotated ">H5 viruses</span> in <span class="match annotated ">mice</span>, indicating that this residue impacts genetically divergent <span class="annotated ">influenza A viruses</span> and suggesting that this region of PB2 could be a new antiviral target. Collectively, the data presented in this study demonstrate that PB2-E158G is a novel pathogenic determinant of <span class="annotated ">influenza A viruses</span> in the <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> model. We speculate that PB2-E158G may be important in the adaptation of avian PB2 genes to other mammals, and BLAST sequence analysis identified a naturally occurring <span class="annotated ">human</span> <span class="annotated ">H1N1pdm</span> isolate that has this substitution. Therefore, future surveillance efforts should include scrutiny of this region of PB2 because of its potential impact on pathogenesis. 
<h3>20980508</h3>Norovirus GII.4 strain antigenic variation.<br><br>Noroviruses are the principal cause of epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide. Multiple reports have concluded that the major capsid proteins of GII.4 strains, which cause 80% of norovirus infections worldwide, are evolving rapidly, resulting in new epidemic strains. Surrogate neutralization assays using sera from outbreaks and from immunized <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> suggest that, as with <span class="annotated ">influenza virus</span>, antigenic variation maintains GII.4 persistence in the face of <span class="annotated ">human</span> population herd immunity. To test this hypothesis, <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> were hyperimmunized with virus-like particles (VLPs) representing an early (GII.4-1987) and a contemporary (GII.4-2006) GII.4 strain. Anti-GII.4-1987 IgG monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) strongly reacted with GII.4 VLPs derived between only 1987 and 2002. Ligand binding blockade was more efficient with GII.4-1987 and GII.4-1997 VLPs than with GII.4-2002. Anti-GII.4-2006 IgG MAbs recognized either a broad panel of GII.4 VLPs (1987 to 2006) or a subset of contemporary (2004 to 2006) VLPs. Most 2006 antibodies did not recognize or only poorly recognized GII.4 VLPs of 2007 or 2008, documenting rapid antigenic evolution of GII.4 capsids. Generally, 2006 MAbs blocked homotypic VLP-ligand binding but were unable to block VLPs representing strains primarily circulating during or earlier than 2002. These analyses demonstrate that both subtle and significant evolutionary change has occurred within antibody epitopes between epidemic strains, providing direct evidence that the GII.4 noroviruses are undergoing antigenic variation, likely in response to herd immunity. As with <span class="annotated ">influenza virus</span>, <span class="annotated ">HIV</span>, and <span class="annotated ">hepatitis C virus</span>, norovirus antigenic variation will significantly influence the design of efficacious vaccines and immunotherapeutics against these important <span class="annotated ">human</span> pathogens. 
<h3>21401592</h3>Negotiating a noisy, information-rich environment in search of cryptic prey: olfactory predators need patchiness in prey cues. <br><br>1. Olfactory predator search processes differ fundamentally to those based on vision, particularly when odour cues are deposited rather than airborne or emanating from a point source. When searching for visually cryptic prey that may have moved some distance from a deposited odour cue, cue context and spatial variability are the most likely sources of information about prey location available to an olfactory predator. 2. We tested whether the <span class="annotated ">house mouse</span> (<span class="annotated ">Mus domesticus</span>), a model olfactory predator, would use cue context and spatial variability when searching for buried food items; specifically, we tested the effect of varying cue patchiness, odour strength, and cue-prey association on <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> foraging success. 3. Within <span class="annotated ">mouse</span>- and predator-proof enclosures, we created grids of 100 sand-filled Petri dishes and buried <span class="annotated ">peanut</span> pieces in a set number of these patches to represent visually cryptic 'prey'. By adding <span class="annotated ">peanut</span> oil to selected dishes, we varied the spatial distribution of prey odour relative to the distribution of prey patches in each grid, to reflect different levels of cue patchiness (Experiment 1), odour strength (Experiment 2) and cue-prey association (Experiment 3). We measured the overnight foraging success of individual <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> (percentage of searched patches containing prey), as well as their foraging activity (percentage of patches searched), and prey survival (percentage of unsearched prey patches). 4. <span class="annotated ">Mouse</span> foraging success was highest where odour cues were patchy rather than uniform (Experiment 1), and where cues were tightly associated with prey location, rather than randomly or uniformly distributed (Experiment 3). However, when cues at prey patches were ten times stronger than a uniformly distributed weak background odour, <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> did not improve their foraging success over that experienced when cues were of uniform strength and distribution (Experiment 2). 5. These results suggest that spatial variability and cue context are important means by which olfactory predators can use deposited odour cues to locate visually cryptic prey. They also indicate that chemical crypsis can disrupt these search processes as effectively as background matching in visually based predator-prey systems. 
<h3>20962081</h3><span class="annotated ">Varicella-zoster virus</span> glycoprotein E is a critical determinant of virulence in the SCID <span class="annotated ">mouse</span>-<span class="annotated ">human</span> model of neuropathogenesis. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Varicella-zoster virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">VZV</span>) is a neurotropic alphaherpesvirus. <span class="annotated ">VZV</span> infection of <span class="annotated ">human</span> dorsal root ganglion (DRG) xenografts in immunodeficient <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> models the infection of sensory ganglia. We examined DRG infection with recombinant <span class="annotated ">VZV</span> (recombinant Oka [rOka]) and the following gE mutants: gEDelta27-90, gEDeltaCys, gE-AYRV, and gE-SSTT. gEDelta27-90, which lacks the gE domain that interacts with a putative receptor insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), replicated as extensively as rOka, producing infectious virions and significant cytopathic effects within 14 days of inoculation. Since neural cells express IDE, the gE/IDE interaction was dispensable for <span class="annotated ">VZV</span> neurotropism. In contrast, gEDeltaCys, which lacks gE/gI heterodimer formation, was significantly impaired at early times postinfection; <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> genome copy numbers increased slowly, and infectious virus production was not detected until day 28. Delayed replication was associated with impaired cell-cell spread in ganglia, similar to the phenotype of a gI deletion mutant (rOkaDeltagI). However, at later time points, infection of satellite cells and other supportive nonneuronal cells resulted in extensive DRG tissue damage and cell loss such that cytopathic changes observed at day 70 were more severe than those for rOka-infected DRG. The replication of gE-AYRV, which is impaired for trans-Golgi network (TGN) localization, and the replication of gE-SSTT, which contains mutations in an acidic cluster, were equivalent to that of rOka, causing significant cytopathic effects and infectious virus production by day 14; genome copy numbers were equivalent to those of rOka. These experiments suggest that the gE interaction with cellular IDE, gE targeting to TGN sites of virion envelopment, and phosphorylation at SSTT are dispensable for <span class="annotated ">VZV</span> DRG infection, whereas the gE/gI interaction is critical for <span class="annotated ">VZV</span> neurovirulence. 
<h3>20962089</h3>Antiviral effects of a transgenic RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.<br><br>Transgenic expression of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3D(pol) inhibited infection of <span class="annotated ">Theiler's murine encephalitis virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">TMEV</span>), a picornavirus from which it was derived. Here, we infected 3D(pol) transgenic <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> with another picornavirus, as well as an alphaherpesvirus and a rhabdovirus. 3D(pol) transgenic FVB <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> had significantly lower <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> loads and survived longer after infection with all three types of <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span> than nontransgenic FVB <span class="match annotated ">mice</span>. Viral inhibition among three different types of virus by transgenic 3D(pol) suggests that the mechanism of action is not the direct interference with picornaviral 3D(pol) but instead may be the changing of host cells to an antiviral state before or after <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> infection occurs, as basal interferon levels were higher in 3D(pol) transgenic <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> before infection. Further study of this mechanism may open new possibilities for future antiviral therapy. 
<h3>20980506</h3>A new model of <span class="annotated ">Epstein-Barr virus</span> infection reveals an important role for earlylytic <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> protein expression in the development of lymphomas.<br><br><span class="annotated ">Epstein-Barr virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">EBV</span>) infects cells in latent or lytic forms, but the roleof lytic infection in <span class="annotated ">EBV</span>-induced lymphomas is unclear. Here, we have used anew humanized <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> model, in which both <span class="annotated ">human</span> fetal CD34(+) hematopoietic stemcells and thymus/liver tissue are transplanted, to compare <span class="annotated ">EBV</span> pathogenesis andlymphoma formation following infection with a lytic replication-defectiveBZLF1-deleted (Z-KO) virus or a lytically active BZLF1(+) control. Both thecontrol and Z-KO <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span> established long-term <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> latency in all infectedanimals. The infection appeared well controlled in some animals, but otherseventually developed CD20(+) diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL). Animalsinfected with the control virus developed tumors more frequently than Z-KOvirus-infected animals. Specific immune responses against <span class="annotated ">EBV</span>-infected B cellswere generated in <span class="match annotated ">mice</span> infected with either the control virus or the Z-KOvirus. In both cases, forms of <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> latency (type I and type IIB) wereobserved that are less immunogenic than the highly transforming form (type III)commonly found in tumors of immunocompromised hosts, suggesting that immunepressure contributed to the outcome of the infection. These results point to animportant role for lytic <span class="annotated ">EBV</span> infection in the development of B cell lymphomasin the context of an active host immune response.
<h3>21498113</h3>New insights into the excystation process and oocyst morphology of <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">rodent</span> Eimeria species. <br><br>In this study, the mechanism of excystation of the <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">rodent</span> parasites <span class="annotated ">Eimeria nieschulzi</span>, from <span class="annotated ">rats</span>, and <span class="annotated ">Eimeria falciformis</span>, from <span class="match annotated ">mice</span>, was investigated. In vitro, oocysts of both species are susceptible to the protease pepsin, and sporocysts and sporozoites can be excysted in a similar way. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed a collapse of the oocysts wall at both polar ends after pepsin treatment. This occurs without any visible damage of the outer wall. Using fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) we observed that pepsin enters sporulated oocysts at both polar ends and causes degradation of the inner oocyst wall. Using scanning electron microscopy we could identify two polar caps in both investigated <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">rodent</span> Eimeria species, but only one is harbouring the micropyle. Thus the polar caps are the entry site for the pepsin. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the oocyst cap and micropyle are functionally different structures. This study complements the morphological description of both Eimeria species and is of relevance for other coccidian species.
