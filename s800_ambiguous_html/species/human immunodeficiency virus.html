<h2>human immunodeficiency virus</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20980521</h3>Characterization of cross-reactive CD8+ T-cell recognition of HLA-A2-restricted <span class="annotated ">HIV</span>-Gag (SLYNTVATL) and <span class="annotated ">HCV</span>-NS5b (ALYDVVSKL) epitopes in individuals infected with <span class="annotated ">human immunodeficiency</span> and <span class="annotated ">hepatitis C viruses</span>. <br><br>The immunologic mechanisms underlying the faster progression of <span class="annotated ">hepatitis C virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">HCV</span>) disease in the presence of <span class="match annotated ">human immunodeficiency virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">HIV</span>) coinfection are not clearly understood. T-cell cross-reactivity between <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> and <span class="annotated ">influenza virus</span>-specific epitopes has been associated with rapid progression of <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> disease (S. Urbani, B. Amadei, P. Fisicaro, M. Pilli, G. Missale, <span class="unannotated ">A</span>. Bertoletti, and C. Ferrari, J. Exp. Med. 201:675-680, 2005). We asked whether T-cell cross-reactivity between <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> and <span class="annotated ">HIV</span> could exist during <span class="annotated ">HCV</span>/<span class="annotated ">HIV</span> coinfection and affect pathogenesis. Our search for amino acid sequence homology between the <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> and <span class="annotated ">HIV</span> proteomes revealed two similar HLA-A2-restricted epitopes, <span class="annotated ">HIV</span>-Gag (SLYNTVATL [HIV-SL9]) and <span class="annotated ">HCV</span>-NS5b (ALYDVVSKL [<span class="annotated ">HCV</span>-AL9]). We found that 4 out of 20 HLA-A2-positive (HLA-A2(+)) <span class="annotated ">HIV</span>-infected individuals had CD8(+) T cells that recognized both the <span class="annotated ">HIV</span>-SL9 and <span class="annotated ">HCV</span>-AL9 epitopes. However, the AL9 epitope was generally shown to be a weak agonist. Although <span class="annotated ">HCV</span>-monoinfected individuals in our study did not show AL9-specific responses, we found that about half of <span class="annotated ">HCV</span>/<span class="annotated ">HIV</span>-coinfected individuals had dual responses to both epitopes. High dual T-cell recognition among coinfected subjects was usually due to separate T-cell populations targeting each epitope, as determined by pentamer staining. The one individual demonstrating cross-reactive T cells to both epitopes showed the most advanced degree of liver disease. In coinfected individuals, we observed a positive correlation between the magnitudes of T-cell responses to both the SL9 and the AL9 epitopes, which was also positively associated with the clinical parameter of liver damage. Thus, we find that <span class="annotated ">HIV</span> infection induces T cells that can cross-react to heterologous <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span> or prime for T cells that are closely related in sequence. However, the induction of cross-reactive T cells may not be associated with control of disease caused by the heterologous virus. This demonstrates that degeneracy of <span class="annotated ">HIV</span>-specific T cells may play a role in the immunopathology of <span class="annotated ">HCV</span>/<span class="annotated ">HIV</span> coinfection.
