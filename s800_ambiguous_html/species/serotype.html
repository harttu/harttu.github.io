<h2>serotype</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20719250</h3>Regulation of virulence factors, carbon utilization and virulence by SNF1 in <span class="annotated ">Cryptococcus neoformans JEC21</span> and divergent actions of SNF1 between cryptococcal strains. <br><br>We describe here the functions of a Snf1/AMPK homolog in the <span class="annotated ">human</span> pathogenic <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">yeast</span> <span class="annotated ">Cryptococcus neoformans</span>, strain <span class="annotated ">JEC21</span>. We found that <span class="annotated ">JEC21</span> SNF1 is a key regulator for the biosynthesis of the major virulence factors, stress resistance and alternative carbon source utilization. Disruption of <span class="annotated ">JEC21</span> SNF1 results in defects of laccase activity and capsule production, sensitivity to cation stress. Especially, we found that <span class="annotated ">JEC21</span> SNF1 is essential for growth at elevated temperature and for thermotolerance. To our knowledge, a role for Snf1 proteins in thermotolerance has not been reported. Furthermore, we observed a functional divergence between <span class="annotated ">JEC21</span> SNF1 and its equivalent from <span class="match unannotated ">serotype</span> <span class="unannotated ">A</span> strain <span class="annotated ">H99</span>. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> high temperature is needed for <span class="annotated ">H99</span> SNF1 to function in stress response and carbon source preference, but not for the <span class="annotated ">JEC21</span> SNF1. Our results confirmed a critical role of <span class="annotated ">JEC21</span> SNF1 in regulation of stress response and virulence. Revelation of divergent actions of SNF1 may help to understand the evolution of cryptococcal pathogenesis and provides insights into the strain-associated biosynthesis of virulence factors. 
<h3>20962088</h3>Multiple innate immune pathways contribute to the immunogenicity of recombinant <span class="unannotated ">adenovirus</span> vaccine vectors. <br><br>The innate immune pathways that contribute to the potent immunogenicity of recombinant <span class="unannotated ">adenovirus</span> (rAd) vaccine vectors remain largely undefined. Previous studies assessing innate immunity triggered by vaccine vectors have largely focused on in vitro studies involving antigen-presenting cells and on early in vivo inflammatory responses. Here, we systematically explore the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling requirements for the generation of cellular immune responses by intramuscular immunization with common and alternative <span class="match unannotated ">serotype</span> rAd vectors in <span class="annotated ">mice</span>. Antigen-specific CD8(+) T-lymphocyte responses elicited by these rAd vectors were significantly diminished in MyD88(-/-) <span class="annotated ">mice</span> but not in TRIF(-/-) or TLR3(-/-) <span class="annotated ">mice</span>, suggesting the importance of MyD88-dependent TLR signaling. However, the absence of each individual TLR resulted in minimal to no effect on vaccine-elicited cellular immune responses. Moreover, responses were not diminished in IL-1R(-/-) or IL-18R(-/-) <span class="annotated ">mice</span>. These data suggest that rAd vectors engage multiple MyD88-dependent signaling pathways, none of which are individually critical; rather, they are integrated to contribute to the potent immunogenicity of rAd vectors. Stimulation of multiple innate immune mechanisms may prove a generalizable property of potent vaccines, and this strategy could be harnessed in the development of next-generation vaccine vectors and adjuvants. 
<h3>21029752</h3>Multiplex PCR for rapid detection of <span class="annotated ">serotype A foot-and-mouth disease virus</span> variants with amino acid deletion at position 59 of the capsid protein VP3. <br><br>In India, there has been co-circulation, extinction and emergence of genotypes/lineages within <span class="match unannotated ">serotype</span> <span class="unannotated ">A</span> foot-and-mouth disease (<span class="annotated ">FMD</span>) virus. At present an antigenically heterogeneous, unique lineage within genotype VII dominates the field outbreaks. This genetic cluster has amino acid deletion at position 59 of VP3 (VP3(59)-deletion group), considered to be critical antigenically. The emergence of this group warrants rapid and accurate detection to facilitate early planning and implementation of an effective control policy. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> rapid multiplex PCR assay was developed for detection of the dominating VP3(59)-deletion group with 100% sensitivity and specificity, even before generating sequence data and confirmatory phylogenetic analysis. This development is important for surveillance of <span class="annotated ">FMD</span> in India. 
<h3>20980526</h3>An in-depth analysis of original antigenic sin in <span class="annotated ">dengue virus</span> infection.<br><br>The evolution of <span class="annotated ">dengue viruses</span> has resulted in four antigenically similar yet distinct serotypes. Infection with one <span class="match unannotated ">serotype</span> likely elicits lifelong immunity to that <span class="match unannotated ">serotype</span>, but generally not against the other three. Secondary or sequential infections are common, as multiple <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> serotypes frequently cocirculate. <span class="annotated ">Dengue</span> infection, although frequently mild, can lead to <span class="annotated ">dengue</span> hemorrhagic fever (DHF) which can be life threatening. DHF is more common in secondary <span class="annotated ">dengue</span> infections, implying a role for the adaptive immune response in the disease. There is currently much effort toward the design and implementation of a <span class="annotated ">dengue</span> vaccine but these efforts are made more difficult by the challenge of inducing durable neutralizing immunity to all four <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span>. Domain 3 of the <span class="annotated ">dengue virus</span> envelope protein (ED3) has been suggested as one such candidate because it contains neutralizing epitopes and it was originally thought that relatively few cross-reactive antibodies are directed to this domain. In this study, we performed a detailed analysis of the anti-ED3 response in a cohort of <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> suffering either primary or secondary <span class="annotated ">dengue</span> infections. The results show dramatic evidence of original antigenic sin in secondary infections both in terms of binding and enhancement activity. This has important implications for <span class="annotated ">dengue</span> vaccine design because heterologous boosting is likely to maintain the immunological footprint of the first vaccination. On the basis of these findings, we propose a simple in vitro enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to diagnose the original <span class="annotated ">dengue</span> infection in secondary <span class="annotated ">dengue</span> cases. 
<h3>21067947</h3>Characterizing the role of RNA silencing components in <span class="annotated ">Cryptococcus neoformans</span>. <br><br>The RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by homology-dependent degradation of the target mRNA with small RNA molecules plays a key role in controlling transcription and translation processes in a number of eukaryotic organisms. The RNAi machinery is also evolutionarily conserved in a wide variety of fungal species, including pathogenic fungi. To elucidate the physiological functions of the RNAi pathway in <span class="annotated ">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> that causes fungal meningitis, here we performed genetic analyses for genes encoding Argonaute (AGO1 and AGO2), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDP1), and Dicers (DCR1 and DCR2) in both <span class="annotated ">serotype A</span><span class="match annotated ">serotype</span> A and D <span class="unannotated ">C. neoformans</span>. The present study shows that Ago1, Rdp1, and Dcr2 are the major components of the RNAi process occurring in <span class="annotated ">C. neoformans</span>. However, the RNAi machinery is not involved in regulation of production of two virulence factors (capsule and melanin), sexual differentiation, and diverse stress response. Comparative transcriptome analysis of the <span class="match unannotated ">serotype</span> <span class="unannotated ">A</span> and D RNAi mutants revealed that only modest changes occur in the genome-wide transcriptome profiles when the RNAi process was perturbed. Notably, the <span class="match unannotated ">serotype</span> D rdp1Delta mutants showed an increase in transcript abundance of active retrotransposons and transposons, such as T2 and T3, the latter of which is a novel <span class="match unannotated ">serotype</span> D-specific transposon of <span class="annotated ">C. neoformans</span>. In a wild type background both T2 and T3 were found to be weakly active mobile elements, although we found no evidence of Cnl1 retrotransposon mobility. In contrast, all three transposable elements exhibited enhanced mobility in the rdp1Delta mutant strain. In conclusion, the RNAi pathway plays an important role in controlling transposon activity and genome integrity of <span class="annotated ">C. neoformans</span>. 
<h3>21492929</h3>Serotype replacement in disease after <span class="unannotated ">pneumococcal</span> vaccination.<br><br>Vaccination with heptavalent <span class="unannotated ">pneumococcal</span> conjugate vaccine (PCV7) has significantly reduced the burden of <span class="unannotated ">pneumococcal</span> disease and has had an important public health benefit. Because this vaccine targets only seven of the more than 92 <span class="unannotated ">pneumococcal</span> serotypes, concerns have been raised that non-vaccine serotypes (NVTs) could increase in prevalence and reduce the benefits of vaccination. Indeed, among asymptomatic carriers, the prevalence of NVTs has increased substantially, and consequently, there has been little or no net change in the bacterial carriage prevalence. In many populations, <span class="unannotated ">pneumococcal</span> disease caused by NVT has increased, but in most cases this increase has been less than the increase in NVT carriage. We review the evidence for <span class="match unannotated ">serotype</span> replacement in carriage and disease, and address the surveillance biases that might affect these findings. We then discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy between near-complete replacement in carriage and partial replacement for disease, including differences in invasiveness between vaccine serotypes. We contend that the magnitude of <span class="match unannotated ">serotype</span> replacement in disease can be attributed, in part, to a combination of lower invasiveness of the replacing serotypes, biases in the pre-vaccine carriage data (unmasking), and biases in the disease surveillance systems that could underestimate the true amount of replacement. We conclude by discussing the future potential for <span class="match unannotated ">serotype</span> replacement in disease and the need for continuing surveillance.
