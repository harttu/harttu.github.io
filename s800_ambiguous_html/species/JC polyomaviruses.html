<h2>JC polyomaviruses</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20863853</h3>Detection and quantitation of infectious <span class="unannotated ">human</span> adenoviruses and <span class="match annotated ">JC polyomaviruses</span> in water by immunofluorescence assay. <br><br>Human adenoviruses (HAdV) and <span class="match annotated ">JC polyomaviruses</span> (<span class="annotated ">JCPyV</span>) have been proposed as markers of fecal/urine contamination of <span class="annotated ">human</span> origin. An indirect immunofluorescence assay has been developed to quantify infectious <span class="annotated ">human adenoviruses types 2</span><span class="annotated ">human adenoviruses types</span> 2 and 41 and <span class="annotated ">JC polyomaviruses strain Mad-4</span> in water samples. The immunofluorescence assay was compared with other quantitative techniques used commonly such as plaque assay, tissue culture infectious dose-50 and quantitative PCR (qPCR). The immunofluorescence assays showed to be specific for the detection of infectious <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span>, obtaining negative results when UV or heat-inactivated <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span> were analyzed. The assays required less time and showed higher sensitivity for the detection of infectious <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> particles than other cell culture techniques (1 log(10) more) evaluated. River water samples spiked previously with <span class="unannotated ">human</span> adenoviruses and raw sewage samples were also analyzed using the proposed immunofluorescence assay as well as by qPCR. The results show quantitations with 2 log(10) reduction in the numbers of infectious <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span> compared with the number of genome copies detected by qPCR. The immunofluorescence assay developed is fast, sensitive, specific, and a standardizable technique for the quantitation and detection of infectious <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span> in water samples.
