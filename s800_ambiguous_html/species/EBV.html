<h2>EBV</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20980506</h3>A new model of <span class="annotated ">Epstein-Barr virus</span> infection reveals an important role for earlylytic <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> protein expression in the development of lymphomas.<br><br><span class="annotated ">Epstein-Barr virus</span> (<span class="match annotated ">EBV</span>) infects cells in latent or lytic forms, but the roleof lytic infection in <span class="match annotated ">EBV</span>-induced lymphomas is unclear. Here, we have used anew humanized <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> model, in which both <span class="annotated ">human</span> fetal CD34(+) hematopoietic stemcells and thymus/liver tissue are transplanted, to compare <span class="match annotated ">EBV</span> pathogenesis andlymphoma formation following infection with a lytic replication-defectiveBZLF1-deleted (Z-KO) virus or a lytically active BZLF1(+) control. Both thecontrol and Z-KO <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span> established long-term <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> latency in all infectedanimals. The infection appeared well controlled in some animals, but otherseventually developed CD20(+) diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL). Animalsinfected with the control virus developed tumors more frequently than Z-KOvirus-infected animals. Specific immune responses against <span class="match annotated ">EBV</span>-infected B cellswere generated in <span class="annotated ">mice</span> infected with either the control virus or the Z-KOvirus. In both cases, forms of <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> latency (type I and type IIB) wereobserved that are less immunogenic than the highly transforming form (type III)commonly found in tumors of immunocompromised hosts, suggesting that immunepressure contributed to the outcome of the infection. These results point to animportant role for lytic <span class="match annotated ">EBV</span> infection in the development of B cell lymphomasin the context of an active host immune response.
