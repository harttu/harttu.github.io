<h2>honey bees</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21410804</h3>Genome-wide analysis of brain transcriptional changes in <span class="annotated ">honey bee</span> (<span class="annotated ">Apis mellifera</span> L.) queens exposed to carbon dioxide and physical manipulation. <br><br>Mating is a complex process causing many behavioural and physiological changes, but the factors triggering them and the underlying molecular processes are not well characterized. In the present study we examine the effects of CO(2) (a commonly used anaesthetic in instrumental insemination that causes changes similar to those occurring after mating) and physical manipulation (which may mimic certain aspects of copulation) on the behavioural, physiological and brain transcriptional changes in <span class="annotated ">honey bee</span> queens. We show that while CO(2) causes cessation of mating flights and ovary activation, physical manipulation has additional effects on ovary activation and brain transcriptional changes. Comparisons with previous studies of <span class="match annotated ">honey bees</span> and female <span class="annotated ">Drosophila</span> indicate that common molecular mechanisms may be responsible for regulating reproductive changes across different mating regimes and insect orders. 
<h3>21797944</h3>Insect insulin receptors: insights from sequence and caste expression analyses of two cloned hymenopteran insulin receptor cDNAs from the <span class="annotated ">fire ant</span>. <br><br>The insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signalling (IIS) pathway in the <span class="annotated ">honey bee</span> (<span class="annotated ">Apis mellifera</span>) is linked to reproductive division of labour and foraging behaviour. Two insulin receptor genes are present in the released genomes of other social hymenopterans. Limited information is available on the IIS pathway role in ants. The predicted insulin receptor sequences from the recently released draft genome of the <span class="annotated ">fire ant</span> <span class="annotated ">Solenopsis invicta</span> (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) are incomplete and biologically significant data are also lacking. To elucidate the role of the IIS pathway in the <span class="unannotated ">fire ant</span>, two putative insulin receptors (SiInR-1 and SiInR-2) were cloned; the first InR cDNAs cloned from social insects. Analyses of putative post-translational modification sites in SiInRs revealed the potential for differential regulation. We investigated the transcriptional expression of both receptors at different developmental stages, castes and queen tissues. In last instar larvae and pharate pupae of workers and reproductive, transcriptional abundance of both receptors was negatively correlated with body size and nutritional status. The expression level of both receptors in different queen tissues appears to correlate with requirements for queen reproductive physiology and behaviours. This study contributes new information to the understanding of social insects because in <span class="annotated ">fire ants</span> juvenile hormone acts as a gonadotropin and workers are fully sterile, contrary to <span class="match annotated ">honey bees</span>. 
<h3>21349120</h3>Neuropeptide Y-like signalling and nutritionally mediated gene expression and behaviour in the <span class="unannotated ">honey bee</span>. <br><br>Previous research has led to the idea that derived traits can arise through the evolution of novel roles for conserved genes. We explored whether neuropeptide Y (NPY)-like signalling, a conserved pathway that regulates food-related behaviour, is involved in a derived, nutritionally-related trait, the division of labour in worker <span class="match unannotated ">honey bees</span>. Transcripts encoding two NPY-like peptides were expressed in separate populations of brain neurosecretory cells, consistent with endocrine functions. NPY-related genes were upregulated in the brains of older foragers compared with younger bees performing brood care ('nurses'). <span class="unannotated ">A</span> subset of these changes can be attributed to nutrition, but neuropeptide F peptide treatments did not influence sugar intake. These results contrast with recent reports of more robust associations between division of labour and the related insulin-signalling pathway and suggest that some elements of molecular pathways associated with feeding behaviour may be more evolutionarily labile than others.
