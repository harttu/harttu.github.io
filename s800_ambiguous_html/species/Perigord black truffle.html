<h2>Perigord black truffle</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEAUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20965267</h3>Distribution and localization of microsatellites in the <span class="match annotated ">Perigord black truffle</span> genome and identification of new molecular markers. <br><br>The level of genetic diversity and genetic structure in the <span class="match annotated ">Perigord black truffle</span> (<span class="annotated ">Tuber melanosporum Vittad.</span>) has been debated for several years, mainly due to the lack of appropriate genetic markers. Microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are important for the genome organisation, phenotypic diversity and are one of the most popular molecular markers. In this study, we surveyed the <span class="annotated ">T. melanosporum</span> genome (1) to characterise its SSR pattern; (2) to compare it with SSR patterns found in 48 other <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> and three oomycetes genomes and (3) to identify new polymorphic SSR markers for population genetics. The <span class="annotated ">T. melanosporum</span> genome is rich in SSRs with 22,425 SSRs with mono-nucleotides being the most frequent motifs. SSRs were found in all genomic regions although they are more frequent in non-coding regions (introns and intergenic regions). Sixty out of 135 PCR-amplified mono-, di-, tri-, tetra, penta, and hexa-nucleotides were polymorphic (44%) within <span class="annotated ">black truffle</span> populations and 27 were randomly selected and analysed on 139 <span class="annotated ">T. melanosporum</span> isolates from France, Italy and Spain. The number of alleles varied from 2 to 18 and the expected heterozygosity from 0.124 to 0.815. One hundred and thirty-two different multilocus genotypes out of the 139 <span class="annotated ">T. melanosporum</span> isolates were identified and the genotypic diversity was high (0.999). Polymorphic SSRs were found in UTR regulatory regions of fruiting bodies and ectomycorrhiza regulated genes, suggesting that they may play a role in phenotypic variation. In conclusion, SSRs developed in this study were highly polymorphic and our results showed that <span class="annotated ">T. melanosporum</span> is a species with an important genetic diversity, which is in agreement with its recently uncovered heterothallic mating system. 
<h3>20884368</h3>The <span class="match annotated ">Perigord black truffle</span> responds to cold temperature with an extensive reprogramming of its transcriptional activity. <br><br>The <span class="annotated ">Tuber melanosporum</span> genome has been analysed with the aim of identifying and characterizing the genes involved in the environmental stress response. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> whole genome array (7496 genes/probe) was used to verify the <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> transcriptional profiling upon a cold temperature period (7 days at 4 ^0C). <span class="unannotated ">A</span> total of 423 genes resulted to be differentially expressed in a significant manner (>2.5-fold; p-value&lt;0.05) in the mycelia exposed to cold, compared to the control ones: 187 of these genes were up-regulated, while 236 were down-regulated. Sixty-six and fifty-one percent, respectively, of the up- or down-regulated transcripts had no KOG classification and were clustered as unclassified proteins, which was the most abundant category in the both up- and down-regulated genes. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> gene subset, containing a range of biological functions, was chosen to validate the microarray experiment through quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). The analysis confirmed the array data for 16 out of 22 of the considered genes, confirming that a cold temperature period influences the <span class="unannotated ">truffle</span> global gene expression. The expressed genes, which mostly resulted to be genes for heat shock proteins (HSPs) and genes involved in cell wall and lipid metabolism, could be involved in mechanisms, which are responsible for <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> adaptation. Since <span class="unannotated ">truffle</span> ascomata develop during the winter period, we hypothesize that these differentially expressed genes may help the <span class="unannotated ">truffle</span> to adapt to low temperatures and/or perceive environmental signals that regulate the fructification.
