<h2>mouse</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20943971</h3>Roles of <span class="annotated ">vaccinia virus</span> genes E3L and K3L and host genes PKR and RNase L during intratracheal infection of C57BL/6 <span class="annotated ">mice</span>. <br><br>The importance of the 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/RNase L and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR) pathways in host interferon induction resulting from virus infection in response to dsRNA has been well documented. In poxvirus infections, the interactions between the <span class="annotated ">vaccinia virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">VV</span>) genes E3L and K3L, which target RNase L and PKR, respectively, serve to prevent the induction of the dsRNA-dependent induced interferon response in cell culture. To determine the importance of these host genes in controlling <span class="annotated ">VV</span> infections, <span class="match annotated ">mouse</span> single-gene knockouts of RNase L and PKR and double-knockout <span class="annotated ">mice</span> were studied following intratracheal infection with <span class="annotated ">VV</span>, VVDeltaK3L, or VVDeltaE3L. <span class="annotated ">VV</span> caused lethal disease in all <span class="match annotated ">mouse</span> strains. The single-knockout animals were more susceptible than wild-type animals, while the RNase L(-/-) PKR(-/-) <span class="annotated ">mice</span> were the most susceptible. VVDeltaE3L infections of wild-type <span class="annotated ">mice</span> were asymptomatic, demonstrating that E3L plays a critical role in controlling the host immune response. RNase L(-/-) <span class="annotated ">mice</span> showed no disease, whereas 20% of the PKR(-/-) <span class="annotated ">mice</span> succumbed at a dose of 10(8) PFU. Lethal disease was routinely observed in RNase L(-/-) PKR(-/-) <span class="annotated ">mice</span> inoculated with 10(8) PFU of VVDeltaE3L, with a distinct pathology. VVDeltaK3L infections exhibited no differences in virulence among any of the <span class="match annotated ">mouse</span> constructs, suggesting that PKR is not the exclusive target of K3L. Surprisingly, VVDeltaK3L did not disseminate to other tissues from the lung. Hence, the cause of death in this model is respiratory disease. These results also suggest that an unanticipated role of the K3L gene is to facilitate virus dissemination. 
<h3>20951743</h3>Development and validation of a lateral flow immunoassay using colloidal gold for the identification of serotype-specific <span class="annotated ">foot-and-mouth disease virus O</span>, <span class="annotated ">A</span> and <span class="annotated ">Asia 1</span>. <br><br>A lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) was developed to identify and diagnose <span class="annotated ">foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) serotypes O</span><span class="annotated ">foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) serotypes</span><span class="annotated ">foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) serotypes</span> O, <span class="unannotated ">A</span> and <span class="unannotated ">Asia 1</span>. Antibodies obtained from <span class="annotated ">rabbits</span> and <span class="annotated ">guinea pigs</span> immunized with cell-culture-adapted virus strains (<span class="annotated ">O/CHA/99</span>, <span class="annotated ">A/GS/LX/66</span>, <span class="annotated ">Asia 1/CHN/05</span>) and suckling-<span class="match annotated ">mouse</span> adapted virus strains (<span class="annotated ">O/AV99(L)</span>, <span class="annotated ">A/AV88(L)</span>, <span class="annotated ">Asia 1/YNBS/58</span>) were used as capture antibodies. The diagnostic kit included three immunochromatographic strips of types <span class="annotated ">O</span>, <span class="annotated ">A</span> and <span class="annotated ">Asia 1</span>, and the type-specific results were confirmed by color on the test lines of the three strips. The LFI was evaluated using epithelial and vesicular samples (n=396) prepared from current and historical field samples (provide by the National Foot-and-Mouth Disease Reference Laboratory of China at Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute). Negative samples (n=95) were collected from healthy animals. The diagnostic sensitivity of the LFI for <span class="annotated ">FMDV serotypes O</span><span class="annotated ">FMDV serotypes</span><span class="annotated ">FMDV serotypes</span> O, <span class="unannotated ">A</span> and <span class="unannotated ">Asia 1</span> was 88.3% compared to 89.7% obtained by the reference method of indirect-sandwich ELISA. The sensitivity of the LFI for <span class="annotated ">FMDV type Asia 1</span> was higher at 92.1% compared to 90.5% for the ELISA. The specificity of the LFI was 97.1% compared with 97.4%. 
<h3>20962097</h3><span class="annotated ">Variola</span> and <span class="annotated ">monkeypox viruses</span> utilize conserved mechanisms of virion motility and release that depend on abl and SRC family tyrosine kinases. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Vaccinia virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">VacV</span>) enters mammalian cells, replicates extranuclearly, and produces virions that move to the cell surface along microtubules, fuse with the plasma membrane, and move from infected cells toward apposing cells on actin-filled membranous protrusions or actin tails. To form actin tails, cell-associated enveloped virions (CEV) require Abl and Src family tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, release of CEV from the cell requires Abl but not Src family tyrosine kinases and is blocked by imatinib mesylate (STI-571; Gleevec), an Abl family kinase inhibitor used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia in <span class="annotated ">humans</span>. Here we demonstrate that the Poxviridae family members <span class="annotated ">monkeypox virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">MPX</span>) and <span class="annotated ">variola virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">VarV</span>) use conserved mechanisms for actin motility and extracellular enveloped virion (EEV) release. Furthermore, we show that imatinib mesylate is effective in a <span class="match annotated ">mouse</span> model of infection with <span class="annotated ">VacV</span>, whether delivered prophylactically or postinfection, and restricts spread of virions from the site of inoculation. While inhibitors of both Src and Abl family kinases, such as dasatinib (BMS-354825; Sprycel), are effective in limiting dissemination of <span class="annotated ">VacV</span>, <span class="annotated ">VarV</span>, and <span class="annotated ">MPX</span> in vitro, members of this class of drugs appear to have immunosuppressive effects in vivo that preclude their use as anti-infectives. Together, these data suggest a possible utility for imatinib mesylate in treating <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">smallpox</span> or <span class="annotated ">MPX</span> infections or complications associated with vaccination. 
<h3>20971911</h3>Glucose-dependent activation of <span class="annotated ">Bacillus anthracis</span> toxin gene expression and virulence requires the carbon catabolite protein CcpA. <br><br>Sensing environmental conditions is an essential aspect of bacterial physiology and virulence. In <span class="annotated ">Bacillus anthracis</span>, the causative agent of <span class="annotated ">anthrax</span>, transcription of the two major virulence factors, toxin and capsule, is triggered by bicarbonate, a major compound in the mammalian body. Here it is shown that glucose is an additional signaling molecule recognized by <span class="annotated ">B. anthracis</span> for toxin synthesis. The presence of glucose increased the expression of the protective antigen toxin component-encoding gene (pagA) by stimulating induction of transcription of the AtxA virulence transcription factor. Induction of atxA transcription by glucose required the carbon catabolite protein CcpA via an indirect mechanism. CcpA did not bind specifically to any region of the extended atxA promoter. The virulence of a <span class="annotated ">B. anthracis strain</span> from which the ccpA gene was deleted was significantly attenuated in a <span class="match annotated ">mouse</span> model of infection. The data demonstrated that glucose is an important host environment-derived signaling molecule and that CcpA is a molecular link between environmental sensing and <span class="annotated ">B. anthracis</span> pathogenesis. 
<h3>20980503</h3><span class="annotated ">Adenovirus</span> membrane penetration activates the NLRP3 inflammasome.<br><br><span class="annotated ">Adenovirus type 5</span> (<span class="annotated ">Ad5</span>) infection of macrophages results in rapid secretion of interleukin-1Beta (IL-1Beta) and is dependent on the inflammasome components NLRP3 and ASC and the catalytic activity of caspase-1. Using lentivirus-expressed short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and competitive inhibitors, we show that Ad-induced IL-1Beta release is dependent upon Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) sensing of the <span class="annotated ">Ad5</span> double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome in <span class="annotated ">human</span> cell lines and primary monocyte-derived macrophages but not in <span class="match annotated ">mouse</span> macrophages. Additionally, a temperature-sensitive mutant of <span class="annotated ">Ad5</span> unable to penetrate endosomal membranes, ts1, is unable to induce IL-1Beta release in TLR2-primed THP-1 cells, suggesting that penetration of endosomal membranes is required for IL-1Beta release. Disruption of lysosomal membranes and the release of cathepsin B into the cytoplasm are required for <span class="annotated ">Ad</span>-induced NLRP3 activation. <span class="annotated ">Ad5</span> cell entry also induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and inhibitors of ROS prevent <span class="annotated ">Ad</span>-induced IL-1Beta release. <span class="annotated ">Ad5</span> activation of NLRP3 also induces necrotic cell death, resulting in the release of the proinflammatory molecule HMGB1. This work further defines the mechanisms of virally induced inflammasome activation. 
<h3>20980509</h3>Reovirus infection or ectopic expression of outer capsid protein micro1 induces apoptosis independently of the cellular proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Mammalian orthoreoviruses</span> induce apoptosis in vivo and in vitro; however, the specific mechanism by which apoptosis is induced is not fully understood. Recent studies have indicated that the reovirus outer capsid protein mu1 is the primary determinant of reovirus-induced apoptosis. Ectopically expressed mu1 induces apoptosis and localizes to intracellular membranes. Here we report that ectopic expression of mu1 activated both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways with activation of initiator caspases-8 and -9 and downstream effector caspase-3. Activation of both pathways was required for mu1-induced apoptosis, as specific inhibition of either caspase-8 or caspase-9 abolished downstream effector caspase-3 activation. Similar to reovirus infection, ectopic expression of mu1 caused release into the cytosol of cytochrome c and smac/DIABLO from the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Pancaspase inhibitors did not prevent cytochrome c release from cells expressing mu1, indicating that caspases were not required. Additionally, mu1- or reovirus-induced release of cytochrome c occurred efficiently in Bax(-/-)Bak(-/-) <span class="match annotated ">mouse</span> embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Finally, we found that reovirus-induced apoptosis occurred in Bax(-/-)Bak(-/-) MEFs, indicating that reovirus-induced apoptosis occurs independently of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bax and Bak. 
<h3>20980515</h3>Reverse genetics generation of chimeric infectious Junin/Lassa virus is dependent on interaction of homologous glycoprotein stable signal peptide and G2 cytoplasmic domains. <br><br>The Arenaviridae are a diverse and globally distributed collection of <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span> that are maintained primarily by <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">rodent</span> reservoirs. <span class="annotated ">Junin virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">JUNV</span>) and <span class="annotated ">Lassa virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">LASV</span>) can both cause significant outbreaks of severe and often fatal <span class="annotated ">human</span> disease throughout their respective areas of endemicity. In an effort to improve upon the existing live attenuated <span class="annotated ">JUNV</span> Candid1 vaccine, we generated a genetically homogenous stock of this virus from cDNA copies of the virus S and L segments by using a reverse genetics system. Further, these cDNAs were used in combination with <span class="annotated ">LASV</span> cDNAs to successfully generate two recombinant Candid1 <span class="annotated ">JUNV</span>/<span class="annotated ">LASV</span> chimeric <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span> (via envelope glycoprotein [GPC] exchange). It was found that while the GPC extravirion domains were readily exchangeable, homologous stable signal peptide (SSP) and G2 transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail domains were essential for correct GPC maturation and production of infectious chimeric <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span>. The switching of the <span class="annotated ">JUNV</span> and <span class="annotated ">LASV</span> G1/G2 ectodomains within the Candid1 vaccine background did not alter the attenuated phenotype of the vaccine strain in a lethal <span class="match annotated ">mouse</span> model. These recombinant chimeric <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span> shed light on the fundamental requirements of arenavirus GPC maturation and may serve as a strategy for the development of bivalent <span class="annotated ">JUNV</span> and <span class="annotated ">LASV</span> vaccine candidates. 
<h3>20980520</h3>Persistent <span class="annotated ">Friend virus</span> replication and disease in Apobec3-deficient <span class="annotated ">mice</span> expressing functional B-cell-activating factor receptor. <br><br>Rfv3 is an autosomal dominant gene that influences the recovery of resistant <span class="annotated ">mice</span> from <span class="annotated ">Friend retrovirus</span> (<span class="annotated ">FV</span>) infection by limiting viremia and promoting a more potent neutralizing antibody response. We previously reported that Rfv3 is encoded by Apobec3, an innate retrovirus restriction factor. However, it was recently suggested that the Rfv3 susceptible phenotype of high viremia at 28 days postinfection (dpi) was more dominantly controlled by the B-cell-activating factor receptor (BAFF-R), a gene that is linked to but located outside the genetically mapped region containing Rfv3. Although one prototypical Rfv3 susceptible <span class="match annotated ">mouse</span> strain, A/WySn, indeed contains a dysfunctional BAFF-R, two other Rfv3 susceptible strains, BALB/c and <span class="unannotated ">A</span>.BY, express functional BAFF-R genes, determined on the basis of genotyping and B-cell immunophenotyping. Furthermore, transcomplementation studies in (C57BL/6 [B6] x BALB/c)F(1) and (B6 x <span class="unannotated ">A</span>.BY)F(1) <span class="annotated ">mice</span> revealed that the B6 Apobec3 gene significantly influences recovery from <span class="annotated ">FV</span> viremia, cellular infection, and disease at 28 dpi. Finally, the Rfv3 phenotypes of prototypic B6, <span class="unannotated ">A</span>.BY, A/WySn, and BALB/c <span class="match annotated ">mouse</span> strains correlate with reported Apobec3 mRNA expression levels. Overall, these findings argue against the generality of BAFF-R polymorphisms as a dominant mechanism to explain the Rfv3 recovery phenotype and further strengthen the evidence that Apobec3 encodes Rfv3. 
<h3>20980523</h3>T cell-mediated protection against lethal 2009 pandemic <span class="annotated ">H1N1 influenza virus</span> infection in a <span class="match annotated ">mouse</span> model. <br><br>Genetic mutation and reassortment of <span class="annotated ">influenza virus</span> gene segments, in particular those of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), that lead to antigenic drift and shift are the major strategies for <span class="annotated ">influenza virus</span> to escape preexisting immunity. The most recent example of such phenomena is the first pandemic of <span class="annotated ">H1N1 influenza</span> of the 21st century, which started in 2009. Cross-reactive antibodies raised against <span class="annotated ">H1N1 viruses</span> circulating before 1930 show protective activity against the 2009 pandemic virus. Cross-reactive T-cell responses can also contribute to protection, but in vivo support of this view is lacking. To explore the protection mechanisms in vivo, we primed <span class="annotated ">mice</span> with <span class="annotated ">H1</span> and <span class="annotated ">H3 influenza virus</span> isolates and rechallenged them with a virus derived from the 2009 <span class="annotated ">H1N1 A/CA/04/09 virus</span>, named CA/E3/09. We found that priming with <span class="annotated ">influenza viruses</span> of both <span class="annotated ">H1</span> and <span class="annotated ">H3</span> homo- and heterosubtypes protected against lethal CA/E3/09 virus challenge. Convalescent-phase sera from these primed <span class="annotated ">mice</span> conferred no neutralization activity in vitro and no protection in vivo. However, T-cell depletion studies suggested that both CD4 and CD8 T cells contributed to the protection. Taken together, these results indicate that cross-reactive T cells established after initial priming with distally related <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span> can be a vital component for prevention of disease and control of pandemic <span class="annotated ">H1N1 influenza virus</span> infection. Our results highlight the importance of establishing cross-reactive T-cell responses for protecting against existing or newly emerging pandemic <span class="annotated ">influenza viruses</span>. 
<h3>21047954</h3>Complement opsonization enhances <span class="annotated ">friend virus</span> infection of B cells and thereby amplifies the virus-specific CD8+ T cell response. <br><br>B cells are one of the targets of <span class="annotated ">Friend virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">FV</span>) infection, a well-established <span class="match annotated ">mouse</span> model often used to study <span class="annotated ">retroviral</span> infections in vivo. Although B cells may be effective in stimulating cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, studies involving their role in <span class="annotated ">FV</span> infection have mainly focused on neutralizing antibody production. Here we show that polyclonal activation of B cells promotes their infection with <span class="annotated ">FV</span> both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that complement opsonization of Friend <span class="annotated ">murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV)</span> enhances infection of B cells, which correlates with increased potency of B cells to activate FV-specific CD8(+) T cells. 
<h3>21349442</h3>The sirtuin pathway in ageing and Alzheimer disease: mechanistic and therapeutic considerations. <br><br>BACKGROUND: Advances in gerontology have yielded crucial insights into the molecular and biochemical aspects of the ageing process. The sirtuin pathway, which is most notable for its association with the anti-ageing effects of calorie restriction, has received particular attention, and pharmacological or transgenic upregulation of the sirtuin pathway has shown promising results in laboratory models of ageing. Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that is imposing an increasing burden on society, and is the leading cause of senile dementia worldwide. The lack of therapies for Alzheimer's disease provides a strong incentive for the development of an effective treatment strategy and, interestingly, research has uncovered a mechanism of action of the sirtuin pathway that might have therapeutic potential for Alzheimer's disease. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: SIRT1, one of the seven mammalian proteins of the sirtuin family of NAD(+)-dependent deacetylases, has recently been shown to attenuate amyloidogenic processing of amyloid-Beta protein precursor (APP) in cell culture studies in vitro and in transgenic <span class="match annotated ">mouse</span> models of Alzheimer's disease. Mechanistically, SIRT1 increases alpha-secretase production and activity through activation of the alpha-secretase gene ADAM10. Because alpha-secretase is the enzyme responsible for the non-amyloidogenic cleavage of APP, upregulation of alpha-secretase shifts APP processing to reduce the pathological accumulation of the presumptive toxic ABeta species that results from Beta-secretase and gamma-secretase activity. Interestingly, the spatial patterns of ABeta deposition in the brain might correlate with increased aerobic glycolysis in those regions. Because aerobic glycolysis depletes cellular levels of NAD(+) (through a decreased NAD(+)/NADH ratio), it is possible that a corresponding downregulation of the NAD(+)-dependent sirtuin pathway contributes to the amyloidogenic processing of APP. WHERE NEXT?: The specific inhibition of ABeta generation by SIRT1 coupled with the potential link between aerobic glycolysis, NAD(+) depletion, and amyloidogenesis through the sirtuin pathway has translational implications. On the one hand, the possible underlying role of the sirtuin pathway in Alzheimer's disease onset and development might increase our understanding of this devastating condition. On the other hand, therapeutic upregulation of SIRT1 might provide opportunities for the amelioration of Alzheimer's-disease-type neuropathology through inhibition of amyloidogenesis. Ultimately, further analysis into both aspects is necessary if any progress is to be made. 
<h3>21907298</h3><span class="annotated ">Galleria mellonella</span> as model host for the trans-kingdom pathogen <span class="annotated ">Fusarium oxysporum</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Fusarium oxysporum</span>, the causal agent of vascular wilt disease, affects a wide range of plant species and can produce disseminated infections in <span class="annotated ">humans</span>. <span class="annotated ">F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici isolate FGSC 9935</span> causes disease both on <span class="annotated ">tomato</span> plants and immunodepressed <span class="annotated ">mice</span>, making it an ideal model for the comparative analysis of fungal virulence on plant and animal hosts. Here we tested the ability of <span class="annotated ">FGSC 9935</span> to cause disease in the <span class="annotated ">greater wax moth</span> <span class="annotated ">Galleria mellonella</span>, an invertebrate model host that is widely used for the study of microbial <span class="annotated ">human</span> pathogens. Injection of living but not of heat-killed microconidia into the hemocoel of <span class="annotated ">G. mellonella</span> larvae resulted in dose-dependent killing both at 30^0C and at 37^0C. Fluorescence microscopy of larvae inoculated with a <span class="annotated ">F. oxysporum</span> transformant expressing GFP revealed hyphal proliferation within the hemocoel, interaction with <span class="annotated ">G. mellonella</span> hemocytes, and colonization of the killed insects by the fungus. Fungal gene knockout mutants previously tested in the <span class="annotated ">tomato</span> and immunodepressed <span class="match annotated ">mouse</span> systems displayed a good correlation in virulence between the Galleria and the <span class="match annotated ">mouse</span> model. Thus, Galleria represents a useful non-vertebrate infection model for studying virulence mechanisms of <span class="annotated ">F. oxysporum</span> on animal hosts. 
<h3>20796206</h3>Linking disease and community ecology through behavioural indicators: immunochallenge of <span class="annotated ">white-footed mice</span> and its ecological impacts. <br><br>1. Pathogens and immune challenges can induce changes in host phenotype in ways that indirectly impact important community interactions, including those that affect host-pathogen interactions. 2. To explore host behavioural response to immune challenge, we exposed wild <span class="annotated ">white-footed mice</span> (<span class="annotated ">Peromyscus leucopus</span>) to an immunogen from an endemic, zoonotic pathogen, the spirochete <span class="annotated ">Borrelia burgdorferi</span>. <span class="annotated ">White-footed mice</span> are a major reservoir host of Lyme disease (LD) spirochetes in northeastern USA and an abundant member of forest communities. The activity patterns, foraging behaviour, and space use of <span class="annotated ">white-footed mice</span> have implications for population growth rates of community members upon which <span class="annotated ">mice</span> incidentally prey (i.e. <span class="annotated ">gypsy moths</span> and native thrushes), as well as potentially determining host-vector encounter rates and <span class="annotated ">human</span> risk of LD. 3. Immunochallenge led to specific humoral (antibody) and cellular (i.e. elevated neutrophils and eosinophils) immune responses, supporting use of the immunogen as a surrogate for pathogenic infection. 4. Immunochallenged <span class="annotated ">mice</span> had reduced wheel-running activity early in the night when measured in the lab. However, <span class="match annotated ">mouse</span> activity, as measured by track plates in natural field experiments, did not differ between <span class="annotated ">mice</span> exposed to the immunogen and unexposed <span class="annotated ">mice</span>. 5. Foraging behaviour of wild <span class="annotated ">mice</span> in the field - assessed with giving-up densities of seed at artificial feeding stations - was affected by exposure to the immunogen. Whereas immunochallenge did not influence whether foraging <span class="annotated ">mice</span> gained information on patch quality while foraging, it led to reductions in predator avoidance during foraging, suggesting that the proportion of space used by foraging <span class="annotated ">mice</span> may be greater as a result of immunochallenge. This increased space use is predicted to increase encounter rates with patchily distributed LD vectors (ticks) and with incidental prey items. 6. Thus, immunochallenge in <span class="annotated ">white-footed mice</span>, and potentially pathogenic infection, have the potential to indirectly impact community interactions, including those important for pathogen transmission. 
<h3>20962098</h3>PB2 residue 158 is a pathogenic determinant of pandemic <span class="annotated ">H1N1</span> and <span class="annotated ">H5 influenza a viruses</span> in <span class="annotated ">mice</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Influenza A viruses</span> are <span class="annotated ">human</span> and animal pathogens that cause morbidity and mortality, which range from mild to severe. The 2009 <span class="annotated ">H1N1</span> pandemic was caused by the emergence of a reassortant <span class="annotated ">H1N1</span> subtype (<span class="annotated ">H1N1pdm</span>) <span class="annotated ">influenza A virus</span> containing gene segments that originally circulated in <span class="annotated ">human</span>, avian, and <span class="annotated ">swine</span> virus reservoirs. The molecular determinants of replication and pathogenesis of <span class="annotated ">H1N1pdm viruses</span> in <span class="annotated ">humans</span> and other mammals are poorly understood. Therefore, we set out to elucidate <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> determinants critical to the pathogenesis of this novel reassortant using a <span class="match annotated ">mouse</span> model. We found that a glutamate-to-glycine substitution at residue 158 of the PB2 gene (PB2-E158G) increased the morbidity and mortality of the parental <span class="annotated ">H1N1pdm virus</span>. Results from mini-genome replication assays in <span class="annotated ">human</span> cells and virus titration in <span class="match annotated ">mouse</span> tissues demonstrated that PB2-E158G is a pathogenic determinant, because it significantly increases <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> replication rates. The virus load in PB2-E158G-infected <span class="match annotated ">mouse</span> lungs was 1,300-fold higher than that of the wild-type virus. Our data also show that PB2-E158G had a much stronger influence on the RNA replication and pathogenesis of <span class="annotated ">H1N1pdm viruses</span> than PB2-E627K, which is a known pathogenic determinant. Remarkably, PB2-E158G substitutions also altered the pathotypes of two avian <span class="annotated ">H5 viruses</span> in <span class="annotated ">mice</span>, indicating that this residue impacts genetically divergent <span class="annotated ">influenza A viruses</span> and suggesting that this region of PB2 could be a new antiviral target. Collectively, the data presented in this study demonstrate that PB2-E158G is a novel pathogenic determinant of <span class="annotated ">influenza A viruses</span> in the <span class="match annotated ">mouse</span> model. We speculate that PB2-E158G may be important in the adaptation of avian PB2 genes to other mammals, and BLAST sequence analysis identified a naturally occurring <span class="annotated ">human</span> <span class="annotated ">H1N1pdm</span> isolate that has this substitution. Therefore, future surveillance efforts should include scrutiny of this region of PB2 because of its potential impact on pathogenesis. 
<h3>21148734</h3>Relating the physical properties of <span class="annotated ">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> lipopolysaccharides to virulence by atomic force microscopy. <br><br>Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are an important class of macromolecules that are components of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria such as <span class="annotated ">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>. <span class="annotated ">P. aeruginosa</span> contains two different sugar chains, the homopolymer common antigen (A band) and the heteropolymer <span class="unannotated ">O</span> antigen (B band), which impart serospecificity. The characteristics of LPS are generally assessed after isolation rather than in the context of whole bacteria. Here we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to probe the physical properties of the LPS of <span class="annotated ">P. aeruginosa strain PA103</span> (serogroup O11) in situ. This strain contains a mixture of long and very long polymers of <span class="unannotated ">O</span> antigen, regulated by two different genes. For this analysis, we studied the wild-type strain and four mutants, DeltaWzz1 (producing only very long LPS), DeltaWzz2 (producing only long LPS), DDeltaM (with both the wzz1 and wzz2 genes deleted), and Wzy::GM (producing an LPS core oligosaccharide plus one unit of <span class="unannotated ">O</span> antigen). Forces of adhesion between the LPS on these strains and the silicon nitride AFM tip were measured, and the Alexander and de Gennes model of steric repulsion between a flat surface and a polymer brush was used to calculate the LPS layer thickness (which we refer to as length), compressibility, and spacing between the individual molecules. LPS chains were longest for the wild-type strain and DeltaWzz1, at 170.6 and 212.4 nm, respectively, and these values were not statistically significantly different from one another. Wzy::GM and DDeltaM have reduced LPS lengths, at 34.6 and 37.7 nm, respectively. Adhesion forces were not correlated with LPS length, but a relationship between adhesion force and bacterial pathogenicity was found in a <span class="match annotated ">mouse</span> acute pneumonia model of infection. The adhesion forces with the AFM probe were lower for strains with LPS mutations, suggesting that the wild-type strain is optimized for maximal adhesion. Our research contributes to further understanding of the role of LPS in the adhesion and virulence of <span class="annotated ">P. aeruginosa</span>. 
<h3>21401592</h3>Negotiating a noisy, information-rich environment in search of cryptic prey: olfactory predators need patchiness in prey cues. <br><br>1. Olfactory predator search processes differ fundamentally to those based on vision, particularly when odour cues are deposited rather than airborne or emanating from a point source. When searching for visually cryptic prey that may have moved some distance from a deposited odour cue, cue context and spatial variability are the most likely sources of information about prey location available to an olfactory predator. 2. We tested whether the <span class="annotated ">house mouse</span> (<span class="annotated ">Mus domesticus</span>), a model olfactory predator, would use cue context and spatial variability when searching for buried food items; specifically, we tested the effect of varying cue patchiness, odour strength, and cue-prey association on <span class="match annotated ">mouse</span> foraging success. 3. Within <span class="match annotated ">mouse</span>- and predator-proof enclosures, we created grids of 100 sand-filled Petri dishes and buried <span class="annotated ">peanut</span> pieces in a set number of these patches to represent visually cryptic 'prey'. By adding <span class="annotated ">peanut</span> oil to selected dishes, we varied the spatial distribution of prey odour relative to the distribution of prey patches in each grid, to reflect different levels of cue patchiness (Experiment 1), odour strength (Experiment 2) and cue-prey association (Experiment 3). We measured the overnight foraging success of individual <span class="annotated ">mice</span> (percentage of searched patches containing prey), as well as their foraging activity (percentage of patches searched), and prey survival (percentage of unsearched prey patches). 4. <span class="annotated ">Mouse</span> foraging success was highest where odour cues were patchy rather than uniform (Experiment 1), and where cues were tightly associated with prey location, rather than randomly or uniformly distributed (Experiment 3). However, when cues at prey patches were ten times stronger than a uniformly distributed weak background odour, <span class="annotated ">mice</span> did not improve their foraging success over that experienced when cues were of uniform strength and distribution (Experiment 2). 5. These results suggest that spatial variability and cue context are important means by which olfactory predators can use deposited odour cues to locate visually cryptic prey. They also indicate that chemical crypsis can disrupt these search processes as effectively as background matching in visually based predator-prey systems. 
<h3>20962081</h3><span class="annotated ">Varicella-zoster virus</span> glycoprotein E is a critical determinant of virulence in the SCID <span class="match annotated ">mouse</span>-<span class="annotated ">human</span> model of neuropathogenesis. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Varicella-zoster virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">VZV</span>) is a neurotropic alphaherpesvirus. <span class="annotated ">VZV</span> infection of <span class="annotated ">human</span> dorsal root ganglion (DRG) xenografts in immunodeficient <span class="annotated ">mice</span> models the infection of sensory ganglia. We examined DRG infection with recombinant <span class="annotated ">VZV</span> (recombinant Oka [rOka]) and the following gE mutants: gEDelta27-90, gEDeltaCys, gE-AYRV, and gE-SSTT. gEDelta27-90, which lacks the gE domain that interacts with a putative receptor insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), replicated as extensively as rOka, producing infectious virions and significant cytopathic effects within 14 days of inoculation. Since neural cells express IDE, the gE/IDE interaction was dispensable for <span class="annotated ">VZV</span> neurotropism. In contrast, gEDeltaCys, which lacks gE/gI heterodimer formation, was significantly impaired at early times postinfection; <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> genome copy numbers increased slowly, and infectious virus production was not detected until day 28. Delayed replication was associated with impaired cell-cell spread in ganglia, similar to the phenotype of a gI deletion mutant (rOkaDeltagI). However, at later time points, infection of satellite cells and other supportive nonneuronal cells resulted in extensive DRG tissue damage and cell loss such that cytopathic changes observed at day 70 were more severe than those for rOka-infected DRG. The replication of gE-AYRV, which is impaired for trans-Golgi network (TGN) localization, and the replication of gE-SSTT, which contains mutations in an acidic cluster, were equivalent to that of rOka, causing significant cytopathic effects and infectious virus production by day 14; genome copy numbers were equivalent to those of rOka. These experiments suggest that the gE interaction with cellular IDE, gE targeting to TGN sites of virion envelopment, and phosphorylation at SSTT are dispensable for <span class="annotated ">VZV</span> DRG infection, whereas the gE/gI interaction is critical for <span class="annotated ">VZV</span> neurovirulence. 
<h3>20980506</h3>A new model of <span class="annotated ">Epstein-Barr virus</span> infection reveals an important role for earlylytic <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> protein expression in the development of lymphomas.<br><br><span class="annotated ">Epstein-Barr virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">EBV</span>) infects cells in latent or lytic forms, but the roleof lytic infection in <span class="annotated ">EBV</span>-induced lymphomas is unclear. Here, we have used anew humanized <span class="match annotated ">mouse</span> model, in which both <span class="annotated ">human</span> fetal CD34(+) hematopoietic stemcells and thymus/liver tissue are transplanted, to compare <span class="annotated ">EBV</span> pathogenesis andlymphoma formation following infection with a lytic replication-defectiveBZLF1-deleted (Z-KO) virus or a lytically active BZLF1(+) control. Both thecontrol and Z-KO <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span> established long-term <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> latency in all infectedanimals. The infection appeared well controlled in some animals, but otherseventually developed CD20(+) diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL). Animalsinfected with the control virus developed tumors more frequently than Z-KOvirus-infected animals. Specific immune responses against <span class="annotated ">EBV</span>-infected B cellswere generated in <span class="annotated ">mice</span> infected with either the control virus or the Z-KOvirus. In both cases, forms of <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> latency (type I and type IIB) wereobserved that are less immunogenic than the highly transforming form (type III)commonly found in tumors of immunocompromised hosts, suggesting that immunepressure contributed to the outcome of the infection. These results point to animportant role for lytic <span class="annotated ">EBV</span> infection in the development of B cell lymphomasin the context of an active host immune response.
<h3>21349440</h3>Neuroinflammation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: role of glial activation in motor neuron disease. <br><br>Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are characterised by the appearance of reactive microglial and astroglial cells, a process referred to as neuroinflammation. In transgenic <span class="match annotated ">mouse</span> models of mutant SOD1-associated familial ALS, reactive microglial cells and astrocytes actively contribute to the death of motor neurons. The biological processes that drive this glial reaction are complex and have both beneficial and deleterious effects on motor neurons. Therapeutic interventions targeting these cells are being explored. An improved understanding of the biological processes that cause neuroinflammation will help to define its medical importance and to identify the therapeutic potential of interfering with this reaction.
