<h2>Human immunodeficiency virus type 1</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20962083</h3>Small-molecule inhibition of <span class="annotated ">human immunodeficiency virus type 1</span> infection by virus capsid destabilization. <br><br><span class="match annotated ">Human immunodeficiency virus type 1</span> (<span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span>) infection is dependent on the proper disassembly of the <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> capsid, or &quot;uncoating,&quot; in target cells. The <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> capsid consists of a conical multimeric complex of the <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> capsid protein (CA) arranged in a hexagonal lattice. Mutations in CA that destabilize the <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> capsid result in impaired infection owing to defects in reverse transcription in target cells. We describe here the mechanism of action of a small molecule <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> inhibitor, PF-3450074 (PF74), which targets CA. PF74 acts at an early stage of <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> infection and inhibits reverse transcription in target cells. We show that PF74 binds specifically to <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> particles, and substitutions in CA that confer resistance to the compound prevent binding. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> single point mutation in CA that stabilizes the <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> core also conferred strong resistance to the virus without inhibiting compound binding. Treatment of <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> particles or purified cores with PF74 destabilized the <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> capsid in vitro. Furthermore, the compound induced the rapid dissolution of the <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> capsid in target cells. PF74 antiviral activity was promoted by binding of the host protein cyclophilin <span class="unannotated ">A</span> to the <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> capsid, and PF74 and cyclosporine exhibited mutual antagonism. Our data suggest that PF74 triggers premature <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> uncoating in target cells, thereby mimicking the activity of the retrovirus restriction factor TRIM5alpha. This study highlights uncoating as a step in the <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> life cycle that is susceptible to small molecule intervention.
