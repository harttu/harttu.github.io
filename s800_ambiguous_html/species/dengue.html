<h2>dengue</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20946918</h3>Evaluation of an immunoglobulin M-specific capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rapid diagnosis of <span class="match annotated ">dengue</span> infection. <br><br>Various assays have been developed to diagnose <span class="annotated ">dengue virus</span> infection, relying on techniques from the fields of serology and molecular biology. Many of these assays have been successful, but there is still an urgent need for accurate, simple and rapid diagnostic assays to diagnose <span class="annotated ">dengue virus</span> infection and to assist in <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patient</span> management. Using a panel of well-characterized sera and a collection of retrospective samples obtained during the <span class="match annotated ">dengue</span> epidemics that occurred in Belem, Brazil, between 2002 and 2009, a modified immunoglobulin M-specific capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Rapid-MAC-ELISA) was evaluated and compared with the &quot;gold standard&quot; MAC-ELISA, in order to assess the specificity, sensitivity, stability, reproducibility and cost-effectiveness of this new assay. These results demonstrated that the Rapid-MAC-ELISA is comparable to the MAC-ELISA in terms of sensitivity and specificity and is highly reproducible; additionally, it is easily performed, less expensive than other available formats and can be completed within three hours. Furthermore, the Rapid-MAC-ELISA can be used for the diagnosis of <span class="annotated ">dengue virus</span> infections in resource-limited areas where <span class="match annotated ">dengue</span> is endemic. 
<h3>20980526</h3>An in-depth analysis of original antigenic sin in <span class="annotated ">dengue virus</span> infection.<br><br>The evolution of <span class="annotated ">dengue viruses</span> has resulted in four antigenically similar yet distinct serotypes. Infection with one <span class="unannotated ">serotype</span> likely elicits lifelong immunity to that <span class="unannotated ">serotype</span>, but generally not against the other three. Secondary or sequential infections are common, as multiple <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> serotypes frequently cocirculate. <span class="annotated ">Dengue</span> infection, although frequently mild, can lead to <span class="match annotated ">dengue</span> hemorrhagic fever (DHF) which can be life threatening. DHF is more common in secondary <span class="match annotated ">dengue</span> infections, implying a role for the adaptive immune response in the disease. There is currently much effort toward the design and implementation of a <span class="match annotated ">dengue</span> vaccine but these efforts are made more difficult by the challenge of inducing durable neutralizing immunity to all four <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span>. Domain 3 of the <span class="annotated ">dengue virus</span> envelope protein (ED3) has been suggested as one such candidate because it contains neutralizing epitopes and it was originally thought that relatively few cross-reactive antibodies are directed to this domain. In this study, we performed a detailed analysis of the anti-ED3 response in a cohort of <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> suffering either primary or secondary <span class="match annotated ">dengue</span> infections. The results show dramatic evidence of original antigenic sin in secondary infections both in terms of binding and enhancement activity. This has important implications for <span class="match annotated ">dengue</span> vaccine design because heterologous boosting is likely to maintain the immunological footprint of the first vaccination. On the basis of these findings, we propose a simple in vitro enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to diagnose the original <span class="match annotated ">dengue</span> infection in secondary <span class="match annotated ">dengue</span> cases. 
<h3>21227500</h3>Continuing challenge of infectious diseases in India.<br><br>In India, the range and burden of infectious diseases are enormous. The administrative responsibilities of the health system are shared between the central (federal) and state governments. Control of diseases and outbreaks is the responsibility of the central Ministry of Health, which lacks a formal public health department for this purpose. Tuberculosis, malaria, filariasis, visceral leishmaniasis, leprosy, <span class="annotated ">HIV</span> infection, and childhood cluster of vaccine-preventable diseases are given priority for control through centrally managed vertical programmes. Control of <span class="annotated ">HIV</span> infection and leprosy, but not of tuberculosis, seems to be on track. Early success of malaria control was not sustained, and visceral leishmaniasis prevalence has increased. Inadequate containment of the vector has resulted in recurrent outbreaks of <span class="match annotated ">dengue</span> fever and re-emergence of <span class="annotated ">Chikungunya virus</span> disease and typhus fever. Other infectious diseases caused by faecally transmitted pathogens (enteric fevers, cholera, <span class="annotated ">hepatitis A</span><span class="annotated ">hepatitis</span> A and E viruses) and zoonoses (rabies, leptospirosis, anthrax) are not in the process of being systematically controlled. Big gaps in the surveillance and response system for infectious diseases need to be addressed. Replication of the model of vertical single-disease control for all infectious diseases will not be efficient or viable. India needs to rethink and revise its health policy to broaden the agenda of disease control. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> comprehensive review and redesign of the health system is needed urgently to ensure equity and quality in health care. We recommend the creation of a functional public health infrastructure that is shared between central and state governments, with professional leadership and a formally trained public health cadre of personnel who manage an integrated control mechanism of diseases in districts that includes infectious and non-infectious diseases, and injuries.
