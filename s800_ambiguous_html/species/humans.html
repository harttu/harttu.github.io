<h2>humans</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20519149</h3>Compartmentalization and molecular traffic in secondary metabolism: a new understanding of established cellular processes. <br><br>Great progress has been made in understanding the regulation of expression of genes involved in secondary metabolism. Less is known about the mechanisms that govern the spatial distribution of the enzymes, cofactors, and substrates that mediate catalysis of secondary metabolites within the cell. Filamentous fungi in the genus Aspergillus synthesize an array of secondary metabolites and provide useful systems to analyze the mechanisms that mediate the temporal and spatial regulation of secondary metabolism in eukaryotes. For example, aflatoxin biosynthesis in <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus parasiticus</span> has been studied intensively because this mycotoxin is highly toxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic in <span class="match annotated ">humans</span> and animals. Using aflatoxin synthesis to illustrate key concepts, this review focuses on the mechanisms by which sub-cellular compartmentalization and intra-cellular molecular traffic contribute to the initiation and completion of secondary metabolism within the cell. We discuss the recent discovery of aflatoxisomes, specialized trafficking vesicles that participate in the compartmentalization of aflatoxin synthesis and export of the toxin to the cell exterior; this work provides a new and clearer understanding of how cells integrate secondary metabolism into basic cellular metabolism via the intra-cellular trafficking machinery. 
<h3>20962084</h3>Modifications in the polymerase genes of a swine-like triple-reassortant <span class="unannotated ">influenza virus</span> to generate live attenuated vaccines against 2009 pandemic <span class="annotated ">H1N1 viruses</span>. <br><br>On 11 June 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the outbreaks caused by novel <span class="annotated ">swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus</span> had reached pandemic proportions. The pandemic <span class="annotated ">H1N1 (H1N1pdm) virus</span> is the predominant <span class="unannotated ">influenza virus</span> strain in the <span class="annotated ">human</span> population. It has also crossed the species barriers and infected <span class="annotated ">turkeys</span> and <span class="annotated ">swine</span> in several countries. Thus, the development of a vaccine that is effective in multiple animal species is urgently needed. We have previously demonstrated that the introduction of temperature-sensitive mutations into the PB2 and PB1 genes of an avian <span class="annotated ">H9N2 virus</span>, combined with the insertion of a hemagglutinin (HA) tag in PB1, resulted in an attenuated (att) vaccine backbone for both <span class="annotated ">chickens</span> and <span class="annotated ">mice</span>. Because the new pandemic strain is a triple-reassortant (TR) virus, we chose to introduce the double attenuating modifications into a <span class="annotated ">swine</span>-like TR virus isolate, <span class="annotated ">A/turkey/OH/313053/04 (H3N2)</span> (ty/04), with the goal of producing live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV). This genetically modified backbone had impaired polymerase activity and restricted virus growth at elevated temperatures. In vivo characterization of two <span class="annotated ">H1N1</span> vaccine candidates generated using the ty/04 att backbone demonstrated that this vaccine is highly attenuated in <span class="annotated ">mice</span>, as indicated by the absence of signs of disease, limited replication, and minimum histopathological alterations in the respiratory tract. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> single immunization with the ty/04 att-based vaccines conferred complete protection against a lethal <span class="annotated ">H1N1pdm virus</span> infection in <span class="annotated ">mice</span>. More importantly, vaccination of <span class="annotated ">pigs</span> with a ty/04 att-<span class="annotated ">H1N1</span> vaccine candidate resulted in sterilizing immunity upon an aggressive intratracheal challenge with the 2009 <span class="annotated ">H1N1</span> pandemic virus. Our studies highlight the safety of the ty/04 att vaccine platform and its potential as a master donor strain for the generation of live attenuated vaccines for <span class="match annotated ">humans</span> and livestock. 
<h3>20962097</h3><span class="annotated ">Variola</span> and <span class="annotated ">monkeypox viruses</span> utilize conserved mechanisms of virion motility and release that depend on abl and SRC family tyrosine kinases. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Vaccinia virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">VacV</span>) enters mammalian cells, replicates extranuclearly, and produces virions that move to the cell surface along microtubules, fuse with the plasma membrane, and move from infected cells toward apposing cells on actin-filled membranous protrusions or actin tails. To form actin tails, cell-associated enveloped virions (CEV) require Abl and Src family tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, release of CEV from the cell requires Abl but not Src family tyrosine kinases and is blocked by imatinib mesylate (STI-571; Gleevec), an Abl family kinase inhibitor used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia in <span class="match annotated ">humans</span>. Here we demonstrate that the Poxviridae family members <span class="annotated ">monkeypox virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">MPX</span>) and <span class="annotated ">variola virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">VarV</span>) use conserved mechanisms for actin motility and extracellular enveloped virion (EEV) release. Furthermore, we show that imatinib mesylate is effective in a <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> model of infection with <span class="annotated ">VacV</span>, whether delivered prophylactically or postinfection, and restricts spread of virions from the site of inoculation. While inhibitors of both Src and Abl family kinases, such as dasatinib (BMS-354825; Sprycel), are effective in limiting dissemination of <span class="annotated ">VacV</span>, <span class="annotated ">VarV</span>, and <span class="annotated ">MPX</span> in vitro, members of this class of drugs appear to have immunosuppressive effects in vivo that preclude their use as anti-infectives. Together, these data suggest a possible utility for imatinib mesylate in treating <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">smallpox</span> or <span class="annotated ">MPX</span> infections or complications associated with vaccination. 
<h3>20970456</h3>Proteotyping to establish the lineage of <span class="annotated ">type A H1N1</span> and <span class="annotated ">type B human influenza virus</span>. <br><br>The ability to establish the lineage of <span class="annotated ">type A H1N1</span> and <span class="annotated ">type B human influenza virus</span> strains using a new proteotyping approach is demonstrated. Lineage-specific signature peptides have been determined for the hemagglutinin antigen of <span class="annotated ">type A H1N1</span> and <span class="annotated ">type B influenza viruses</span>. The detection of these peptides alone within the high resolution mass spectra of whole antigen digests enables the lineage of the strain to be rapidly and unequivocally assigned. This proteotyping approach complements conventional PCR approaches and should aid in the monitoring of the evolution of the <span class="unannotated ">influenza virus</span> in both <span class="match annotated ">humans</span> and animals. 
<h3>20980507</h3>Successful vaccination strategies that protect aged <span class="annotated ">mice</span> from lethal challenge from <span class="annotated ">influenza virus</span> and heterologous <span class="annotated ">severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus</span>. <br><br>Newly emerging <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span> often circulate as a heterogeneous swarm in wild animal reservoirs prior to their emergence in <span class="match annotated ">humans</span>, and their antigenic identities are often unknown until an outbreak situation. The newly emerging <span class="annotated ">severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus</span> (<span class="annotated ">SARS-CoV</span>) and reemerging <span class="annotated ">influenza virus</span> cause disproportionate disease in the aged, who are also notoriously difficult to successfully vaccinate, likely due to immunosenescence. To protect against future emerging strains, vaccine platforms should induce broad cross-reactive immunity that is sufficient to protect from homologous and heterologous challenge in all ages. From initial studies, we hypothesized that attenuated <span class="annotated ">Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">VEE</span>) replicon particle (VRP) vaccine glycoproteins mediated vaccine failure in the aged. We then compared the efficacies of vaccines bearing attenuated (VRP(3014)) or wild-type <span class="annotated ">VEE</span> glycoproteins (VRP(3000)) in young and aged <span class="annotated ">mice</span> within novel models of severe <span class="annotated ">SARS-CoV</span> pathogenesis. Aged animals receiving VRP(3000)-based vaccines were protected from <span class="annotated ">SARS-CoV</span> disease, while animals receiving the VRP(3014)-based vaccines were not. The superior protection for the aged observed with VRP(3000)-based vaccines was confirmed in a lethal <span class="annotated ">influenza virus</span> challenge model. While the VRP(3000) vaccine's immune responses in the aged were sufficient to protect against lethal homologous and heterologous challenge, our data suggest that innate defects within the VRP(3014) platform mediate vaccine failure. Exploration into the mechanism(s) of successful vaccination in the immunosenescent should aid in the development of successful vaccine strategies for other <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> diseases disproportionately affecting the elderly, like <span class="annotated ">West Nile virus</span>, <span class="annotated ">influenza virus</span>, norovirus, or other emerging <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span> of the future. 
<h3>21057010</h3>Biochemical characterization of UDP-Gal:GlcNAc-pyrophosphate-lipid Beta-1,4-Galactosyltransferase WfeD, a new enzyme from <span class="annotated ">Shigella boydii</span> type 14 that catalyzes the second step in O-antigen repeating-unit synthesis. <br><br>The <span class="unannotated ">O</span> antigen is the outer part of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and contains many repeats of an oligosaccharide unit. It contributes to antigenic variability and is essential to the full function and virulence of bacteria. Shigella is a Gram-negative <span class="annotated ">human</span> pathogen that causes diarrhea in <span class="match annotated ">humans</span>. The <span class="unannotated ">O</span> antigen of <span class="annotated ">Shigella boydii</span> type 14 consists of repeating oligosaccharide units with the structure [->6-d-Galpalpha1->4-d-GlcpABeta1->6-d-GalpBeta1->4-d-GalpBeta1->4-d-GlcpNAcBeta1->]n. The wfeD gene in the O-antigen gene cluster of <span class="annotated ">Shigella boydii</span> type 14 was proposed to encode a galactosyltransferase (GalT) involved in O-antigen synthesis. We confirmed here that the wfeD gene product is a Beta4-GalT that synthesizes the GalBeta1-4GlcNAcalpha-R linkage. WfeD was expressed in <span class="annotated ">Escherichia coli</span>, and the activity was characterized by using UDP-[^3H]Gal as the donor substrate as well as the synthetic acceptor substrate GlcNAcalpha-pyrophosphate-(CH2)11-O-phenyl. The enzyme product was analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and galactosidase digestion. The enzyme was shown to be specific for the UDP-Gal donor substrate and required pyrophosphate in the acceptor substrate. Divalent metal ions such as Mn^2(+), Ni^2(+), and, surprisingly, also Pb^2(+) enhanced the enzyme activity. Mutational analysis showed that the Glu101 residue within a DxD motif is essential for activity, possibly by forming the catalytic nucleophile. The Lys211 residue was also shown to be required for activity and may be involved in the binding of the negatively charged acceptor substrate. Our study revealed that the Beta4-GalT WfeD is a novel enzyme that has virtually no sequence similarity to mammalian Beta4-GalT, although it catalyzes a similar reaction. 
<h3>21147038</h3>Disrupted energy metabolism and neuronal circuit dysfunction in cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. <br><br>Epidemiological, neuropathological, and functional neuroimaging evidence implicates global and regional disruptions in brain metabolism and energetics in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment. Nerve cell microcircuits are modified by excitatory and inhibitory synaptic activity and neurotrophic factors. Ageing and Alzheimer's disease cause perturbations in cellular energy metabolism, level of excitation or inhibition, and neurotrophic factor release, which overwhelm compensatory mechanisms and result in dysfunction of neuronal microcircuits and brain networks. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> prolonged positive energy balance impairs the ability of neurons to adapt to oxidative and metabolic stress. Results from experimental studies in animals show how disruptions caused by chronic positive energy balance, such as diabetes, lead to accelerated cognitive ageing and Alzheimer's disease. Therapeutic interventions to allay cognitive dysfunction that target energy metabolism and adaptive stress responses (such as neurotrophin signalling) have been effective in animal models and in preliminary studies in <span class="match annotated ">humans</span>. 
<h3>21216300</h3>The genetic basis for 3-ADON and 15-ADON trichothecene chemotypes in Fusarium.<br><br>Certain Fusarium species cause head blight of <span class="annotated ">wheat</span> and other small grains worldwide and produce trichothecene mycotoxins. These mycotoxins can induce toxicoses in animals and <span class="match annotated ">humans</span> and can contribute to the ability of some fusaria to cause plant disease. Production of the trichothecene 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-ADON) versus 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-ADON) is an important phenotypic difference within and among some Fusarium species. However, until now, the genetic basis for this difference in chemotype has not been identified. Here, we identified consistent DNA sequence differences in the coding region of the trichothecene biosynthetic gene TRI8 in 3-ADON and 15-ADON strains. Functional analyses of the TRI8 enzyme (Tri8) in <span class="annotated ">F. graminearum</span>, the predominant cause of <span class="annotated ">wheat</span> head blight in North America and Europe, revealed that Tri8 from 3-ADON strains catalyzes deacetylation of the trichothecene biosynthetic intermediate 3,15-diacetyldeoxynivalenol at carbon 15 to yield 3-ADON, whereas Tri8 from 15-ADON strains catalyzes deacetylation of 3,15-diacetyldeoxynivalenol at carbon 3 to yield 15-ADON. Fusarium strains that produce the trichothecene nivalenol have a Tri8 that functions like that in 15-ADON strains. TRI3, which encodes a trichothecene carbon 15 acetyltransferase, was found to be functional in all three chemotypes. Together, our data indicate that differential activity of Tri8 determines the 3-ADON and 15-ADON chemotypes in Fusarium. 
<h3>21496127</h3>A role for endosomal proteins in alphavirus dissemination in mosquitoes.<br><br>Little is known about endosomal pathway proteins involved in arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) assembly and cell-to-cell spread in vector mosquitoes. UNC93A and synaptic vesicle-2 (SV2) proteins are involved in intracellular transport in mammals. They show amino acid sequence conservation from mosquitoes to <span class="match annotated ">humans</span>, and their transcripts are highly enriched in <span class="annotated ">Aedes aegypti</span> during arbovirus infection. Transient gene silencing of SV2 or UNC93A in mosquitoes infected with the recombinant alphavirus <span class="annotated ">Sindbis</span> MRE16-enhanced green fluorescent protein (<span class="annotated ">SINV</span>; family Togaviridae) resulted in the accumulation of <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> positive- and negative-strand RNA, congregation of virus envelope antigen in intracellular networks, and reduced virus dissemination outside of the midgut. Further, UNC93A silencing, but not SV2 silencing, resulted in a 10-fold reduction in <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> titres at 4 days post-infection. Together, these data support a role for UNC93A and SV2 in virus assembly or budding. Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) were identified at the 5'-ends of genes from the original data set in which SV2 and UNC93A were identified. Common CREs at the 5'-end genomic regions of a subset of enriched transcripts support the hypothesis that UNC93A transcription may be co-regulated with that of other ion transport and endosomal trafficking proteins. 
<h3>21907298</h3><span class="annotated ">Galleria mellonella</span> as model host for the trans-kingdom pathogen <span class="annotated ">Fusarium oxysporum</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Fusarium oxysporum</span>, the causal agent of vascular wilt disease, affects a wide range of plant species and can produce disseminated infections in <span class="match annotated ">humans</span>. <span class="annotated ">F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici isolate FGSC 9935</span> causes disease both on <span class="annotated ">tomato</span> plants and immunodepressed <span class="annotated ">mice</span>, making it an ideal model for the comparative analysis of fungal virulence on plant and animal hosts. Here we tested the ability of <span class="annotated ">FGSC 9935</span> to cause disease in the <span class="annotated ">greater wax moth</span> <span class="annotated ">Galleria mellonella</span>, an invertebrate model host that is widely used for the study of microbial <span class="annotated ">human</span> pathogens. Injection of living but not of heat-killed microconidia into the hemocoel of <span class="annotated ">G. mellonella</span> larvae resulted in dose-dependent killing both at 30^0C and at 37^0C. Fluorescence microscopy of larvae inoculated with a <span class="annotated ">F. oxysporum</span> transformant expressing GFP revealed hyphal proliferation within the hemocoel, interaction with <span class="annotated ">G. mellonella</span> hemocytes, and colonization of the killed insects by the fungus. Fungal gene knockout mutants previously tested in the <span class="annotated ">tomato</span> and immunodepressed <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> systems displayed a good correlation in virulence between the Galleria and the <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> model. Thus, Galleria represents a useful non-vertebrate infection model for studying virulence mechanisms of <span class="annotated ">F. oxysporum</span> on animal hosts. 
<h3>20817114</h3>Activation of the heat shock transcription factor Hsf1 is essential for the full virulence of the fungal pathogen <span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span>. <br><br>The evolutionarily conserved heat shock transcription factor Hsf1 plays a central role in thermal adaptation in the major fungal pathogen of <span class="match annotated ">humans</span>, <span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span>. Hsf1 becomes hyperphosphorylated in response to heat shock and activates the transcription of genes with heat shock elements (HSEs) in their promoters, these genes contributing to thermal adaptation. However, the relevance of Hsf1 activation to <span class="annotated ">C. albicans</span> virulence is not clear as this pathogen is thought to be obligately associated with warm blooded animals, and this issue has not been tested because HSF1 is essential for viability in <span class="annotated ">C. albicans</span>. In this study, we demonstrate that the HSE regulon is active in <span class="annotated ">C. albicans</span> cells infecting the kidney. We also show the CE2 region of Hsf1 is required for activation and that the phosphorylation of specific residues in this domain contributes to Hsf1 activation. <span class="annotated ">C. albicans</span> HSF1 mutants that lack this CE2 region are viable. However, they are unable to activate HSE-containing genes in response to heat shock, and they are thermosensitive. Using this HSF1 CE2 deletion mutant we demonstrate that Hsf1 activation, and hence thermal adaptation, contributes significantly to the virulence of <span class="annotated ">C. albicans</span>. 
<h3>20962098</h3>PB2 residue 158 is a pathogenic determinant of pandemic <span class="annotated ">H1N1</span> and <span class="annotated ">H5 influenza a viruses</span> in <span class="annotated ">mice</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Influenza A viruses</span> are <span class="annotated ">human</span> and animal pathogens that cause morbidity and mortality, which range from mild to severe. The 2009 <span class="annotated ">H1N1</span> pandemic was caused by the emergence of a reassortant <span class="annotated ">H1N1</span> subtype (<span class="annotated ">H1N1pdm</span>) <span class="annotated ">influenza A virus</span> containing gene segments that originally circulated in <span class="annotated ">human</span>, avian, and <span class="annotated ">swine</span> virus reservoirs. The molecular determinants of replication and pathogenesis of <span class="annotated ">H1N1pdm viruses</span> in <span class="match annotated ">humans</span> and other mammals are poorly understood. Therefore, we set out to elucidate <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> determinants critical to the pathogenesis of this novel reassortant using a <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> model. We found that a glutamate-to-glycine substitution at residue 158 of the PB2 gene (PB2-E158G) increased the morbidity and mortality of the parental <span class="annotated ">H1N1pdm virus</span>. Results from mini-genome replication assays in <span class="annotated ">human</span> cells and virus titration in <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> tissues demonstrated that PB2-E158G is a pathogenic determinant, because it significantly increases <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> replication rates. The virus load in PB2-E158G-infected <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> lungs was 1,300-fold higher than that of the wild-type virus. Our data also show that PB2-E158G had a much stronger influence on the RNA replication and pathogenesis of <span class="annotated ">H1N1pdm viruses</span> than PB2-E627K, which is a known pathogenic determinant. Remarkably, PB2-E158G substitutions also altered the pathotypes of two avian <span class="annotated ">H5 viruses</span> in <span class="annotated ">mice</span>, indicating that this residue impacts genetically divergent <span class="annotated ">influenza A viruses</span> and suggesting that this region of PB2 could be a new antiviral target. Collectively, the data presented in this study demonstrate that PB2-E158G is a novel pathogenic determinant of <span class="annotated ">influenza A viruses</span> in the <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> model. We speculate that PB2-E158G may be important in the adaptation of avian PB2 genes to other mammals, and BLAST sequence analysis identified a naturally occurring <span class="annotated ">human</span> <span class="annotated ">H1N1pdm</span> isolate that has this substitution. Therefore, future surveillance efforts should include scrutiny of this region of PB2 because of its potential impact on pathogenesis. 
<h3>21029747</h3>A fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based fluorometer assay for screening anti-coxsackievirus B3 compounds. <br><br>In view of the need to develop a simple and rapid method to screen for antiviral therapeutic agents, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based reporter system consisting of engineered mammalian cells expressing a cyan fluorescent protein-yellow fluorescent protein (CFP-YFP) pair linked by a short peptide containing the cleavage site of <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> protease 2A (2A(pro)) was developed. By detecting the 2A(pro) produced early during the virus infection cycle, the CFP-YFP pair effectively identifies infectious <span class="annotated ">coxsackievirus B3</span> (<span class="annotated ">CVB3</span>), a picornavirus that causes <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> myocarditis in <span class="match annotated ">humans</span>. The reporter system was used to screen a library of 2000 drugs and natural products for potential antiviral compounds. The reporter cells were treated with the test compounds, challenged with <span class="annotated ">CVB3</span>, and then examined using a fluorometer at 24h post-infection. Sixty-four compounds, mostly therapeutic drugs, antimicrobial compounds and compounds with unknown functions, caused at least 50% inhibition of 2A(pro) activity. Three known antiviral compounds, cosmosiin, ribavirin and baicalein, were also identified in the screening. The developed method is an effective strategy for rapid screening, and identifies compounds that inhibit <span class="annotated ">CVB3</span> 2A(pro). This method should be a valuable aid in the antiviral drug discovery effort. 
<h3>21295520</h3>Increased sampling reveals novel lineages of Entamoeba: consequences of genetic diversity and host specificity for taxonomy and molecular detection. <br><br>To expand the representation for phylogenetic analysis, ten additional complete Entamoeba small-subunit rRNA gene sequences were obtained from <span class="match annotated ">humans</span>, non-human primates, <span class="annotated ">cattle</span> and a tortoise. For some novel sequences no corresponding morphological data were available, and we suggest that these organisms should be referred to as ribosomal lineages (RL) rather than being assigned species names at present. To investigate genetic diversity and host specificity of selected Entamoeba species, a total of 91 new partial small subunit rRNA gene sequences were obtained, including 49 from <span class="annotated ">Entamoeba coli</span>, 18 from <span class="annotated ">Entamoeba polecki</span>, and 17 from <span class="annotated ">Entamoeba hartmanni</span>. We propose a new nomenclature for significant variants within established Entamoeba species. Based on current data we propose that the uninucleated-cyst-producing Entamoeba infecting <span class="match annotated ">humans</span> is called <span class="annotated ">Entamoeba polecki</span> and divided into four subtypes (ST1-ST4) and that <span class="annotated ">Entamoeba coli</span> is divided into two subtypes (ST1-ST2). New hosts for several species were detected and, while host specificity and genetic diversity of several species remain to be clarified, it is clear that previous reliance on cultivated material has given us a misleading and incomplete picture of variation within the genus Entamoeba.
