<h2>P. maidis</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21199018</h3>Analysis of expressed sequence tags from <span class="annotated ">Maize mosaic rhabdovirus</span>-infected gut tissues of <span class="annotated ">Peregrinus maidis</span> reveals the presence of key components of insect innate immunity. <br><br>The <span class="annotated ">corn planthopper</span>, <span class="annotated ">Peregrinus maidis</span>, causes direct feeding damage to plants and transmits <span class="annotated ">Maize mosaic rhabdovirus (MMV)</span> in a persistent-propagative manner. <span class="annotated ">MMV</span> must cross several insect tissue layers for successful transmission to occur, and the gut serves as an important barrier for rhabdovirus transmission. In order to facilitate the identification of proteins that may interact with <span class="annotated ">MMV</span> either by facilitating acquisition or responding to <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> infection, we generated and analysed the gut transcriptome of <span class="match annotated ">P. maidis</span>. From two normalized cDNA libraries, we generated a <span class="match annotated ">P. maidis</span> gut transcriptome composed of 20,771 expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Assembly of the sequences yielded 1860 contigs and 14,032 singletons, and biological roles were assigned to 5793 (36%). Comparison of <span class="match annotated ">P. maidis</span> ESTs with other insect amino acid sequences revealed that <span class="match annotated ">P. maidis</span> shares greatest sequence similarity with another hemipteran, the <span class="annotated ">brown planthopper</span> <span class="annotated ">Nilaparvata lugens</span>. We identified 202 <span class="match annotated ">P. maidis</span> transcripts with putative homology to proteins associated with insect innate immunity, including those implicated in the Toll, Imd, JAK/STAT, Jnk and the small-interfering RNA-mediated pathways. Sequence comparisons between our <span class="match annotated ">P. maidis</span> gut EST collection and the currently available National Center for Biotechnology Information EST database collection for <span class="annotated ">Ni. lugens</span> revealed that a pathogen recognition receptor in the Imd pathway, peptidoglycan recognition protein-long class (PGRP-LC), is present in these two members of the family Delphacidae; however, these recognition receptors are lacking in the model hemipteran <span class="annotated ">Acyrthosiphon pisum</span>. In addition, we identified sequences in the <span class="match annotated ">P. maidis</span> gut transcriptome that share significant amino acid sequence similarities with the rhabdovirus receptor molecule, acetylcholine receptor (AChR), found in other hosts. This EST analysis sheds new light on immune response pathways in hemipteran guts that will be useful for further dissecting innate defence response pathways to rhabdovirus infection.
