<h2>Sunflower stem weevil</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>22182606</h3><span class="match annotated ">Sunflower stem weevil</span> and its larval parasitoids in native <span class="annotated ">sunflowers</span>: is parasitoid abundance and diversity greater in the u.s. Southwest? <br><br>Classical biological control programs often target a pest's region of origin as a likely source for new biological control agents. Here, we use this approach to search for biological control agents of the <span class="annotated ">sunflower stem weevil</span> (<span class="annotated ">Cylindrocopturus adspersus</span> LeConte), an economically important pest of commercial <span class="annotated ">sunflower</span>. We conducted surveys of weevil natural enemy diversity and abundance across a transect running from the northern Great Plains to the southwestern U.S. (the presumed area of endemism of annual <span class="annotated ">sunflower</span> species in the genus Helianthus). Accordingly, natural enemy diversity and abundance were expected to be greater in the southwestern U.S. <span class="annotated ">C. adspersus</span> and their larval parasitoids were collected from stems of four native <span class="annotated ">sunflower</span> species (<span class="annotated ">Helianthus annuus</span>, <span class="annotated ">H. nuttallii</span>, <span class="annotated ">H. pauciflorus</span>, and <span class="annotated ">H. petiolaris</span>) from 147 sites across eight states. Native <span class="annotated ">H. annuus</span> constituted the majority of the <span class="annotated ">sunflower</span> populations. Mean weevil densities were significantly higher in <span class="annotated ">sunflower</span> stalks that were larger in diameter. Mean weevil densities within sites did not differ across the range of longitudes and latitudes sampled. After accounting for the effects of stalk diameter and location, weevil densities did not differ among the four <span class="annotated ">sunflower</span> species nor did they differ as a function of elevation. <span class="annotated ">C. adspersus</span> in <span class="annotated ">H. annuus</span> and <span class="annotated ">H. petiolaris</span> were attacked by seven species of parasitoids. No parasitoids were found attacking <span class="annotated ">C. adspersus</span> in <span class="annotated ">H. nuttallii</span> or <span class="annotated ">H. pauciflorus</span> stalks. <span class="annotated ">C. adspersus</span> were twice as likely to be attacked by a parasitoid when feeding on <span class="annotated ">H. petiolaris</span> than <span class="annotated ">H. annuus</span>. Furthermore, the likelihood that <span class="annotated ">C. adspersus</span> would be parasitized decreased with increasing elevation and increasing stem diameters. All parasitoid species have been previously reported attacking <span class="annotated ">C. adspersus</span> larvae in cultivated <span class="annotated ">sunflower</span>. Species richness was less diverse in these collections than from previous studies of cultivated <span class="annotated ">sunflower</span>. Our findings suggest that the species of larval parasitoids attacking <span class="annotated ">C. adspersus</span> in native <span class="annotated ">sunflowers</span> have successfully made the transition to cultivated <span class="annotated ">sunflower</span>.
