<h2>F. verticillioides</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20887797</h3>The FvMK1 mitogen-activated protein kinase gene regulates conidiation, pathogenesis, and fumonisin production in <span class="annotated ">Fusarium verticillioides</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Fusarium verticillioides</span> is one of the most important <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> pathogens to cause destructive diseases of <span class="annotated ">maize</span> worldwide. Fumonisins produced by the fungus are harmful to <span class="annotated ">human</span> and animal health. To date, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with pathogenicity and fumonisin biosynthesis in <span class="match annotated ">F. verticillioides</span> is limited. Because MAP kinase pathways have been implicated in regulating diverse processes important for plant infection in phytopathogenic fungi, in this study we identified and functionally characterized the FvMK1 gene in <span class="match annotated ">F. verticillioides</span>. FvMK1 is orthologous to FMK1 in <span class="annotated ">F. oxysporum</span> and GPMK1 in <span class="annotated ">F. graminearum</span>. The Fvmk1 deletion mutant was reduced in vegetative growth and production of microconidia. However, it was normal in sexual reproduction and increased in the production of macroconidia. In infection assays with developing <span class="annotated ">corn</span> kernels, the Fvmk1 mutant was non-pathogenic and failed to colonize through wounding sites. It also failed to cause stalk rot symptoms beyond the inoculation sites on <span class="annotated ">corn</span> stalks, indicating that FvMK1 is essential for plant infection. Furthermore, the Fvmk1 mutant was significantly reduced in fumonisin production and expression levels of FUM1 and FUM8, two genes involved in fumonisin biosynthesis. The defects of the Fvmk1 mutant were fully complemented by re-introducing the wild type FvMK1 allele. These results demonstrate that FvMK1 plays critical roles in the regulation of vegetative growth, asexual reproduction, fumonisin biosynthesis, and pathogenicity.
