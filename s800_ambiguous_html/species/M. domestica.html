<h2>M. domestica</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>22182611</h3>Laboratory and Field Evaluation of Formulated <span class="annotated ">Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis</span> as a Feed Additive and Using Topical Applications for Control of <span class="annotated ">Musca domestica</span> (Diptera: Muscidae) Larvae in Caged-Poultry Manure. <br><br>Infestations of <span class="annotated ">house flies</span>, <span class="annotated ">Musca domestica</span> L., are a continual problem around poultry establishments. Acute toxicity of two commercial <span class="annotated ">Bacillus thuringiensis variety israelensis</span> (<span class="annotated ">Bti</span>) formulations (water-dispersible granules and bran formulation) was evaluated against larvae in the laboratory and against natural populations of <span class="match annotated ">M. domestica</span> larvae in the field applied in feed to <span class="annotated ">chickens</span> and as topical applications in the poultry houses. Bioassay data showed that susceptibility of <span class="match annotated ">M. domestica</span> larvae increased to a given concentration of <span class="annotated ">Bti</span> as the duration of exposure increased. In the laboratory studies, the LC(50) values of <span class="annotated ">Bti</span> for the larvae ranged between 65 and 77.4 mug/ml. In the field, a concentration of 10 g <span class="annotated ">Bti</span>/kg of feed resulted in 90% reduction of larvae at 4 wk after treatment. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> higher concentration (2 g/liter) of <span class="annotated ">Bti</span> in spray applications was not significantly more effective than the lower concentration of 1 g/liter. Adding <span class="annotated ">Bti</span> to <span class="annotated ">chicken</span> feed is potentially an efficient measure for the management and control of <span class="annotated ">house flies</span> in caged-poultry facilities.
