<h2>Human</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20962093</h3><span class="match annotated ">Human</span> pluripotent stem cells produce natural killer cells that mediate anti-<span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> activity by utilizing diverse cellular mechanisms. <br><br>Cell-based therapies against HIV/AIDS have been gaining increased interest. Natural killer (NK) cells are a key component of the innate immune system with the ability to kill diverse tumor cells and virus-infected cells. While NK cells have been shown to play an important role in the control of <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> replication, their functional activities are often compromised in <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span>-infected individuals. We have previously demonstrated the derivation of NK cells from <span class="annotated ">human</span> embryonic stem cells (hESCs) with the ability to potently kill multiple types of tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. We now demonstrate the derivation of functional NK cells from <span class="unannotated ">human</span> induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). More importantly, both hESC- and iPSC-derived NK cells are able to inhibit <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> NL4-3 infection of CEM-GFP cells. Additional studies using <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span>-infected <span class="unannotated ">human</span> primary CD4(+) T cells illustrated that hESC- and iPSC-derived NK cells suppress <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> infection by at least three distinct cellular mechanisms: killing of infected targets through direct lysis, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and production of chemokines and cytokines. Our results establish the potential to utilize hESC- and iPSC-derived NK cells to better understand anti-<span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> immunity and provide a novel cellular immunotherapeutic approach to treat HIV/AIDS. 
<h3>21227499</h3><span class="match annotated ">Human</span> resources for health in India.<br><br>India has a severe shortage of <span class="annotated ">human</span> resources for health. It has a shortage of qualified health workers and the workforce is concentrated in urban areas. Bringing qualified health workers to rural, remote, and underserved areas is very challenging. Many Indians, especially those living in rural areas, receive care from unqualified providers. The migration of qualified allopathic doctors and nurses is substantial and further strains the system. Nurses do not have much authority or say within the health system, and the resources to train them are still inadequate. Little attention is paid during medical education to the medical and public health needs of the population, and the rapid privatisation of medical and nursing education has implications for its quality and governance. Such issues are a result of underinvestment in and poor governance of the health sector--two issues that the government urgently needs to address. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> comprehensive national policy for <span class="annotated ">human</span> resources is needed to achieve universal health care in India. The public sector will need to redesign appropriate packages of monetary and non-monetary incentives to encourage qualified health workers to work in rural and remote areas. Such a policy might also encourage task-shifting and mainstreaming doctors and practitioners who practice traditional Indian medicine (ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy, unani, and siddha) and homoeopathy to work in these areas while adopting other innovative ways of augmenting <span class="annotated ">human</span> resources for health. At the same time, additional investments will be needed to improve the relevance, quantity, and quality of nursing, medical, and public health education in the country. 
<h3>21269674</h3><span class="match annotated ">Human</span> resources for health in southeast Asia: shortages, distributional challenges, and international trade in health services. <br><br>In this paper, we address the issues of shortage and maldistribution of health personnel in southeast Asia in the context of the international trade in health services. Although there is no shortage of health workers in the region overall, when analysed separately, five low-income countries have some deficit. All countries in southeast Asia face problems of maldistribution of health workers, and rural areas are often understaffed. Despite a high capacity for medical and nursing training in both public and private facilities, there is weak coordination between production of health workers and capacity for employment. Regional experiences and policy responses to address these challenges can be used to inform future policy in the region and elsewhere. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> distinctive feature of southeast Asia is its engagement in international trade in health services. Singapore and Malaysia import health workers to meet domestic demand and to provide services to international <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span>. Thailand attracts many foreign <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> for health services. This situation has resulted in the so-called brain drain of highly specialised staff from public medical schools to the private hospitals. The Philippines and Indonesia are the main exporters of doctors and nurses in the region. Agreements about mutual recognition of professional qualifications for three groups of health workers under the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Framework Agreement on Services could result in increased movement within the region in the future. To ensure that vital <span class="annotated ">human</span> resources for health are available to meet the needs of the populations that they serve, migration management and retention strategies need to be integrated into ongoing efforts to strengthen health systems in southeast Asia. There is also a need for improved dialogue between the health and trade sectors on how to balance economic opportunities associated with trade in health services with domestic health needs and equity issues.
