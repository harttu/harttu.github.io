<h2>bee</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20958807</h3>Profile of the mosaic element BTMR1 in the genome of the bumble <span class="match unannotated ">bee</span> <span class="annotated ">Bombus terrestris</span> (Hymenoptera: Apidae). <br><br>Co-evolution involving a mariner transposon, Botmar1 and the other repeats contained in the <span class="annotated ">Bombus terrestris</span> genome was investigated. We found that the 5'-region of Botmar1 forms one of the components of a mosaic element, known as <span class="annotated ">B. terrestris</span> mosaic repeat 1 (BTMR1), which is also composed of inner segments originating from two different retrotransposons and a pseudogene corresponding to an RNA methyltransferase cDNA. The fact that BTMR1 is interspersed within chromosomes and the differences in its abundance in different species indicate that it is very probably a mobile element. Nevertheless, the absences of direct or inverted repeats at its ends and of target site duplication indicate that its mobility is not ensured by a cardinal transposable element, but putatively by a Crypton-like element. 
<h3>20977508</h3>DNA modifications and genome rearrangements during the development and sex differentiation of the bumble <span class="match unannotated ">bee</span> <span class="annotated ">Bombus terrestris</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Bombus terrestris</span> is a bumble <span class="match unannotated ">bee</span> that, like most hymenopteran species, exhibits ploidy-specific sex determination controlled by a single sex gene. Depending on their ploidy and the queen pheromone repression, the imagoes differentiate into three castes: males, workers and queens. Here, we focus on the differences of genome organization that occur during development and sex differentiation. We found that cytosine methylation is a significant epigenetic factor with profiles that can be correlated with both processes. We also showed that two kinds of genomic rearrangement occur. The first consists of important DNA amplifications that have sequence profiles that differ in the different developmental instars and sexes. In the second kind, DNA losses also occur, at least involving the mosaic transposable element <span class="annotated ">B. terrestris</span> mosaic repeat 1 (BTMR1). 
<h3>22182621</h3>The Role of Frass and Cocoon Volatiles in Host Location by <span class="unannotated ">Monodontomerus aeneus</span>, a Parasitoid of Megachilid Solitary <span class="annotated ">Bees</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Monodontomerus aeneus</span> (Fonscolombe) is a parasitic wasp that oviposits on the prepupae and pupae of <span class="annotated ">Osmia cornuta</span> (Latreille) and other solitary <span class="match annotated ">bee</span> species. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> two-armed olfactometer was used to test the olfactory attractiveness of <span class="annotated ">O. cornuta</span> prepupae, cocoon, and larval frass to female <span class="annotated ">M. aeneus</span>. Both cocoon and frass attracted the female parasitoids, but frass alone was more attractive than the cocoon and the cocoon with frass was more attractive than frass alone. Female parasitoids were not attracted by the host prepupa. M33 (methanol) was the organic volatile most emitted by cocoons and m61 (acetic acid) was the compound most emitted by frass. However, cocoons showed higher emission for almost all compounds, including m61 (acetic acid). Although acetic acid alone attracted <span class="annotated ">M. aeneus</span>, a complex volatile signal is probably involved in the attraction process because the ratio of acetic acid and acetaldehyde characteristic of the frass was more attractive than other ratios.
