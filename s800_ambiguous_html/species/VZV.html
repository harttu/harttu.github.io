<h2>VZV</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20980518</h3>Upregulation of CXCL10 in <span class="annotated ">human</span> dorsal root ganglia during experimental and natural <span class="annotated ">varicella-zoster virus</span> infection. <br><br>Varicella-zoster <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> (<span class="match annotated ">VZV</span>) reactivation causes herpes zoster, which is accompanied by an influx of lymphocytes into affected ganglia, but the stimulus for this infiltrate is not known. We report that <span class="match annotated ">VZV</span> infection of ganglia leads to increased CXCL10 production in vitro, in an explant ganglion model and in naturally infected dorsal root ganglia (DRG) during herpes zoster. Lymphocytes expressing the receptor for CXCL10, CXCR3, were also observed throughout naturally infected ganglia during herpes zoster, including immediately adjacent to neurons. This study identifies <span class="annotated ">VZV-induced</span> CXCL10 as a potential driver of T lymphocyte recruitment into DRG during herpes zoster. 
<h3>20962082</h3>The alphaherpesvirus US3/ORF66 protein kinases direct phosphorylation of the nuclear matrix protein matrin 3. <br><br>The protein kinase found in the short region of alphaherpesviruses, termed US3 in <span class="annotated ">herpes simplex virus type 1</span> (<span class="annotated ">HSV-1</span>) and <span class="annotated ">pseudorabies virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">PRV</span>) and ORF66 in <span class="annotated ">varicella-zoster virus</span> (<span class="match annotated ">VZV</span>), affects several <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> and host cell processes, and its specific targets remain an area of active investigation. Reports suggesting that <span class="annotated ">HSV-1</span> US3 substrates overlap with those of cellular protein kinase <span class="unannotated ">A</span> (PKA) prompted the use of an antibody specific for phosphorylated PKA substrates to identify US3/ORF66 targets. <span class="annotated ">HSV-1</span>, <span class="match annotated ">VZV</span>, and <span class="annotated ">PRV</span> induced very different substrate profiles that were US3/ORF66 kinase dependent. The predominant <span class="match annotated ">VZV</span>-phosphorylated 125-kDa species was identified as matrin 3, one of the major nuclear matrix proteins. Matrin 3 was also phosphorylated by <span class="annotated ">HSV-1</span> and <span class="annotated ">PRV</span> in a US3 kinase-dependent manner and by <span class="match annotated ">VZV</span> ORF66 kinase at a novel residue (KRRRT150EE). Since <span class="match annotated ">VZV</span>-directed T150 phosphorylation was not blocked by PKA inhibitors and was not induced by PKA activation, and since PKA predominantly targeted matrin 3 S188, it was concluded that phosphorylation by <span class="match annotated ">VZV</span> was PKA independent. However, purified <span class="match annotated ">VZV</span> ORF66 kinase did not phosphorylate matrin 3 in vitro, suggesting that additional cellular factors were required. In <span class="match annotated ">VZV</span>-infected cells in the absence of the ORF66 kinase, matrin 3 displayed intranuclear changes, while matrin 3 showed a pronounced cytoplasmic distribution in late-stage cells infected with US3-negative <span class="annotated ">HSV-1</span> or <span class="annotated ">PRV</span>. This work identifies phosphorylation of the nuclear matrix protein matrin 3 as a new conserved target of this kinase group. 
<h3>20962081</h3><span class="annotated ">Varicella-zoster virus</span> glycoprotein E is a critical determinant of virulence in the SCID mouse-<span class="annotated ">human</span> model of neuropathogenesis. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Varicella-zoster virus</span> (<span class="match annotated ">VZV</span>) is a neurotropic alphaherpesvirus. <span class="match annotated ">VZV</span> infection of <span class="annotated ">human</span> dorsal root ganglion (DRG) xenografts in immunodeficient <span class="unannotated ">mice</span> models the infection of sensory ganglia. We examined DRG infection with recombinant <span class="match annotated ">VZV</span> (recombinant Oka [rOka]) and the following gE mutants: gEDelta27-90, gEDeltaCys, gE-AYRV, and gE-SSTT. gEDelta27-90, which lacks the gE domain that interacts with a putative receptor insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), replicated as extensively as rOka, producing infectious virions and significant cytopathic effects within 14 days of inoculation. Since neural cells express IDE, the gE/IDE interaction was dispensable for <span class="match annotated ">VZV</span> neurotropism. In contrast, gEDeltaCys, which lacks gE/gI heterodimer formation, was significantly impaired at early times postinfection; <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> genome copy numbers increased slowly, and infectious <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> production was not detected until day 28. Delayed replication was associated with impaired cell-cell spread in ganglia, similar to the phenotype of a gI deletion mutant (rOkaDeltagI). However, at later time points, infection of satellite cells and other supportive nonneuronal cells resulted in extensive DRG tissue damage and cell loss such that cytopathic changes observed at day 70 were more severe than those for rOka-infected DRG. The replication of gE-AYRV, which is impaired for trans-Golgi network (TGN) localization, and the replication of gE-SSTT, which contains mutations in an acidic cluster, were equivalent to that of rOka, causing significant cytopathic effects and infectious <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> production by day 14; genome copy numbers were equivalent to those of rOka. These experiments suggest that the gE interaction with cellular IDE, gE targeting to TGN sites of virion envelopment, and phosphorylation at SSTT are dispensable for <span class="match annotated ">VZV</span> DRG infection, whereas the gE/gI interaction is critical for <span class="match unannotated ">VZV</span> neurovirulence.
