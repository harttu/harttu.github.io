<h2>retroviral</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21047954</h3>Complement opsonization enhances <span class="annotated ">friend virus</span> infection of B cells and thereby amplifies the virus-specific CD8+ T cell response. <br><br>B cells are one of the targets of <span class="annotated ">Friend virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">FV</span>) infection, a well-established <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> model often used to study <span class="match annotated ">retroviral</span> infections in vivo. Although B cells may be effective in stimulating cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, studies involving their role in <span class="annotated ">FV</span> infection have mainly focused on neutralizing antibody production. Here we show that polyclonal activation of B cells promotes their infection with <span class="annotated ">FV</span> both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that complement opsonization of Friend <span class="annotated ">murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV)</span> enhances infection of B cells, which correlates with increased potency of B cells to activate FV-specific CD8(+) T cells. 
<h3>20933542</h3>The rapid production of high-titer <span class="annotated ">porcine endogenous retrovirus(PERV)-B</span> env pseudotype and construction of an EGFP-expressing replication competent <span class="unannotated ">PERV-A</span> vector. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Porcine endogenous retroviruses</span> (<span class="annotated ">PERVs</span>) present a unique concern associated with xenotransplantation because they have been shown to infect certain <span class="annotated ">human</span> cells in vitro and it is also difficult to generate herds of <span class="annotated ">pigs</span> free of <span class="annotated ">PERVs</span>. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> simple system for the production of high-titer MoMLV-PERV pseudotypes is reported; an EGFP-expressing replication-competent molecular clone that allows direct measurement of titer was also constructed. To improve the MLV-based <span class="match annotated ">retroviral</span> vector system, a 2.1-kb <span class="annotated ">PERV-B</span> env product was amplified from PK-15 genomic DNA and cloned into the pCL-Eco <span class="match unannotated ">retroviral</span> vector. The titer of lacZ (<span class="annotated ">PERV-B</span>) from the 293 cells was about 1.0x10(4) CFU/ml. In contrast, the titer of lacZ (<span class="annotated ">PERV-B</span>) from a conventional <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">murine</span> <span class="match annotated ">retroviral</span> vector (split genome) was found to be 1.2x10(2) CFU/ml when the <span class="annotated ">PERV-B</span> env expression vector was transfected into TELCeB6 cells, which harbor MFGnlslacZ and the gag-pol-expressing vector. In addition, an infectious <span class="annotated ">PERV-A</span> clone containing enhanced GFP (EGFP) by using a PCR-based method was developed. This EGFP-expressing PERV-A-IRES-EGFP molecular clone was found to be stable genetically on transfection in 293 cells.
