<h2>BMV</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21039559</h3>Systemic virus-induced gene silencing allows functional characterization of <span class="annotated ">maize</span> genes during biotrophic interaction with <span class="annotated ">Ustilago maydis</span>. <br><br>Infection of <span class="annotated ">maize</span> (<span class="annotated ">Zea mays</span>) plants with the <span class="annotated ">corn smut fungus</span> <span class="annotated ">Ustilago maydis</span> leads to the formation of large tumors on the stem, leaves and inflorescences. In this biotrophic interaction, plant defense responses are actively suppressed by the pathogen, and previous transcriptome analyses of infected <span class="annotated ">maize</span> plants showed massive and stage-specific changes in host gene expression during disease progression. To identify <span class="annotated ">maize</span> genes that are functionally involved in the interaction with <span class="annotated ">U. maydis</span>, we adapted a virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) system based on the <span class="annotated ">brome mosaic virus</span> (<span class="match annotated ">BMV</span>) for <span class="annotated ">maize</span>. Conditions were established that allowed successful <span class="annotated ">U. maydis</span> infection of <span class="match annotated ">BMV</span>-preinfected <span class="annotated ">maize</span> plants. This set-up enabled quantification of VIGS and its impact on <span class="annotated ">U. maydis</span> infection using a quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)-based readout. In proof-of-principle experiments, an <span class="annotated ">U. maydis</span>-induced terpene synthase was shown to negatively regulate disease development while a protein involved in cell death inhibition was required for full virulence of <span class="annotated ">U. maydis</span>. The results suggest that this system is a versatile tool for the rapid identification of <span class="annotated ">maize</span> genes that determine compatibility with <span class="annotated ">U. maydis</span>.
