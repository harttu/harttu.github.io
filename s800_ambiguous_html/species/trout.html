<h2>trout</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21198589</h3>Ice-cover effects on competitive interactions between two fish species.<br><br>1. Variations in the strength of ecological interactions between seasons have received little attention, despite an increased focus on climate alterations on ecosystems. Particularly, the winter situation is often neglected when studying competitive interactions. In northern temperate freshwaters, winter implies low temperatures and reduced food availability, but also strong reduction in ambient light because of ice and snow cover. Here, we study how <span class="annotated ">brown trout</span> [<span class="annotated ">Salmo trutta</span> (L.)] respond to variations in ice-cover duration and competition with <span class="annotated ">Arctic charr</span> [<span class="annotated ">Salvelinus alpinus</span> (L.)], by linking laboratory-derived physiological performance and field data on variation in abundance among and within natural <span class="annotated ">brown trout</span> populations. 2. Both <span class="annotated ">Arctic charr</span> and <span class="annotated ">brown trout</span> reduced resting metabolic rate under simulated ice-cover (darkness) in the laboratory, compared to no ice (6-h daylight). However, in contrast to <span class="annotated ">brown trout</span>, <span class="annotated ">Arctic charr</span> was able to obtain positive growth rate in darkness and had higher food intake in tank experiments than <span class="annotated ">brown trout</span>. <span class="annotated ">Arctic charr</span> also performed better (lower energy loss) under simulated ice-cover in a semi-natural environment with natural food supply. 3. When comparing <span class="annotated ">brown trout</span> biomass across 190 Norwegian lakes along a climate gradient, longer ice-covered duration decreased the biomass only in lakes where <span class="annotated ">brown trout</span> lived together with <span class="annotated ">Arctic charr</span>. We were not able to detect any effect of ice-cover on <span class="annotated ">brown trout</span> biomass in lakes where <span class="annotated ">brown trout</span> was the only fish species. 4. Similarly, a 25-year time series from a lake with both <span class="annotated ">brown trout</span> and <span class="annotated ">Arctic charr</span> showed that <span class="annotated ">brown trout</span> population growth rate depended on the interaction between ice breakup date and <span class="annotated ">Arctic charr</span> abundance. High <span class="annotated ">charr</span> abundance was correlated with low <span class="match unannotated ">trout</span> population growth rate only in combination with long winters. 5. In conclusion, the two species differed in performance under ice, and the observed outcome of competition in natural populations was strongly dependent on duration of the ice-covered period. Our study shows that changes in ice phenology may alter species interactions in Northern aquatic systems. Increased knowledge of how adaptations to winter conditions differ among coexisting species is therefore vital for our understanding of ecological impacts of climate change. 
<h3>21426342</h3>Introduced <span class="annotated ">brown trout</span> alter native acanthocephalan infections in native fish.<br><br>1. Native parasite acquisition provides introduced species with the potential to modify native host-parasite dynamics by acting as parasite reservoirs (with the 'spillback' of infection increasing the parasite burdens of native hosts) or sinks (with the 'dilution' of infection decreasing the parasite burdens of native hosts) of infection. 2. In New Zealand, negative correlations between the presence of introduced <span class="annotated ">brown trout</span> (<span class="annotated ">Salmo trutta</span>) and native parasite burdens of the native <span class="annotated ">roundhead galaxias</span> (<span class="annotated ">Galaxias anomalus</span>) have been observed, suggesting that parasite dilution is occurring. 3. We used a multiple-scale approach combining field observations, experimental infections and dynamic population modelling to investigate whether native Acanthocephalus galaxii acquisition by <span class="annotated ">brown trout</span> alters host-parasite dynamics in native <span class="annotated ">roundhead galaxias</span>. 4. Field observations demonstrated higher infection intensity in introduced <span class="match unannotated ">trout</span> than in <span class="annotated ">native galaxias</span>, but only small, immature <span class="unannotated ">A</span>. galaxii were present in <span class="match annotated ">trout</span>. Experimental infections also demonstrated that <span class="unannotated ">A</span>. galaxii does not mature in <span class="match annotated ">trout</span>, although parasite establishment and initial growth were similar in the two hosts. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that <span class="match annotated ">trout</span> may serve as an infection sink for the native parasite. 5. However, dynamic population modelling predicts that <span class="unannotated ">A</span>. galaxii infections in native <span class="annotated ">galaxias</span> should at most only be slightly reduced by dilution in the presence of <span class="match annotated ">trout</span>. Rather, model exploration indicates parasite densities in <span class="annotated ">galaxias</span> are highly sensitive to <span class="annotated ">galaxias</span> predation on infected amphipods, and to relative abundances of <span class="annotated ">galaxias</span> and <span class="match annotated ">trout</span>. Hence, <span class="match annotated ">trout</span> presence may instead reduce parasite burdens in <span class="annotated ">galaxias</span> by either reducing <span class="annotated ">galaxias</span> density or by altering <span class="annotated ">galaxias</span> foraging behaviour. 
<h3>21463300</h3>Heating up relations between cold fish: competition modifies responses to climate change. <br><br>Most predictions about species responses to climate change ignore species interactions. Helland and colleagues (2011) test whether this assumption is valid by evaluating whether ice cover affects competition between <span class="annotated ">brown trout</span> [<span class="annotated ">Salmo trutta</span> (L.)] and <span class="annotated ">Arctic charr</span> [<span class="annotated ">Salvelinus alpines</span> (L.)]. They show that increasing ice cover correlates with lower <span class="match unannotated ">trout</span> biomass when <span class="annotated ">Arctic charr</span> co-occur, but not in <span class="annotated ">charr's</span> absence. In experiments, <span class="annotated ">charr</span> grew better in the cold, dark environments that typify ice-covered lakes. Decreasing ice cover with warmer winters could mean more <span class="match unannotated ">trout</span> and fewer <span class="annotated ">charr</span>. More generally, their results provide an excellent example, suggesting that species interactions can strongly modify responses to climate change.
