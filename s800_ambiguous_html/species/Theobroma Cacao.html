<h2>Theobroma Cacao</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>22182619</h3>Dispersion Models and Sampling of Cacao Mirid Bug <span class="annotated ">Sahlbergella singularis</span> (Hemiptera: Miridae) on <span class="match annotated ">Theobroma Cacao</span> in Southern Cameroon. <br><br>The spatio-temporal distribution of <span class="annotated ">Sahlbergella singularis</span> Haglung, a major pest of <span class="annotated ">cacao</span> trees (<span class="annotated ">Theobroma cacao</span>) (Malvaceae), was studied for 2 yr in traditional <span class="annotated ">cacao</span> forest gardens in the humid forest area of southern Cameroon. The first objective was to analyze the dispersion of this insect on <span class="annotated ">cacao</span> trees. The second objective was to develop sampling plans based on fixed levels of precision for estimating <span class="annotated ">S. singularis</span> populations. The following models were used to analyze the data: Taylor's power law, Iwao's patchiness regression, the Nachman model, and the negative binomial distribution. Our results document that Taylor's power law was a better fit for the data than the Iwao and Nachman models. Taylor's b and Iwao's Beta were both significantly &gt;1, indicating that <span class="annotated ">S. singularis</span> aggregated on specific trees. This result was further supported by the calculated common k of 1.75444. Iwao's alpha was significantly &lt;0, indicating that the basic distribution component of <span class="annotated ">S. singularis</span> was the individual insect. Comparison of negative binomial (NBD) and Nachman models indicated that the NBD model was appropriate for studying <span class="annotated ">S. singularis</span> distribution. Optimal sample sizes for fixed precision levels of 0.10, 0.15, and 0.25 were estimated with Taylor's regression coefficients. Required sample sizes increased dramatically with increasing levels of precision. This is the first study on <span class="annotated ">S. singularis</span> dispersion in <span class="annotated ">cacao</span> plantations. Sampling plans, presented here, should be a tool for research on population dynamics and pest management decisions of mirid bugs on <span class="annotated ">cacao</span>.
