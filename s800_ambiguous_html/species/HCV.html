<h2>HCV</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20962076</h3>Neutralizing antibody-resistant <span class="annotated ">hepatitis C virus</span> cell-to-cell transmission.<br><br>Hepatitis C <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> (<span class="match annotated ">HCV</span>) can initiate infection by cell-free particle and cell-cell contact-dependent transmission. In this study we use a novel infectious coculture system to examine these alternative modes of infection. Cell-to-cell transmission is relatively resistant to <span class="annotated ">anti-HCV</span> glycoprotein monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal immunoglobulin isolated from infected individuals, providing an effective strategy for escaping host humoral immune responses. Chimeric viruses expressing the structural proteins representing the seven major <span class="match annotated ">HCV</span> genotypes demonstrate neutralizing antibody-resistant cell-to-cell transmission. <span class="match annotated ">HCV</span> entry is a multistep process involving numerous receptors. In this study we demonstrate that, in contrast to earlier reports, CD81 and the tight-junction components claudin-1 and occludin are all essential for both cell-free and cell-to-cell <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> transmission. However, scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) has a more prominent role in cell-to-cell transmission of the <span class="unannotated ">virus</span>, with SR-BI-specific antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors showing preferential inhibition of this infection route. These observations highlight the importance of targeting host cell receptors, in particular SR-BI, to control <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> infection and spread in the liver. 
<h3>20980521</h3>Characterization of cross-reactive CD8+ T-cell recognition of HLA-A2-restricted HIV-Gag (SLYNTVATL) and HCV-NS5b (ALYDVVSKL) epitopes in individuals infected with <span class="annotated ">human immunodeficiency</span> and <span class="annotated ">hepatitis C viruses</span>. <br><br>The immunologic mechanisms underlying the faster progression of <span class="unannotated ">hepatitis C virus</span> (<span class="match annotated ">HCV</span>) disease in the presence of <span class="annotated ">human immunodeficiency virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">HIV</span>) coinfection are not clearly understood. T-cell cross-reactivity between <span class="match annotated ">HCV</span> and <span class="unannotated ">influenza</span> virus-specific epitopes has been associated with rapid progression of <span class="match annotated ">HCV</span> disease (S. Urbani, B. Amadei, P. Fisicaro, M. Pilli, G. Missale, <span class="unannotated ">A</span>. Bertoletti, and C. Ferrari, J. Exp. Med. 201:675-680, 2005). We asked whether T-cell cross-reactivity between <span class="match unannotated ">HCV</span> and <span class="annotated ">HIV</span> could exist during <span class="match annotated ">HCV</span>/<span class="annotated ">HIV</span> coinfection and affect pathogenesis. Our search for amino acid sequence homology between the <span class="match unannotated ">HCV</span> and <span class="annotated ">HIV</span> proteomes revealed two similar HLA-A2-restricted epitopes, HIV-Gag (SLYNTVATL [HIV-SL9]) and <span class="match annotated ">HCV</span>-NS5b (ALYDVVSKL [<span class="match annotated ">HCV</span>-AL9]). We found that 4 out of 20 HLA-A2-positive (HLA-A2(+)) <span class="annotated ">HIV</span>-infected individuals had CD8(+) T cells that recognized both the <span class="annotated ">HIV</span>-SL9 and HCV-AL9 epitopes. However, the AL9 epitope was generally shown to be a weak agonist. Although HCV-monoinfected individuals in our study did not show AL9-specific responses, we found that about half of HCV/<span class="annotated ">HIV</span>-coinfected individuals had dual responses to both epitopes. High dual T-cell recognition among coinfected subjects was usually due to separate T-cell populations targeting each epitope, as determined by pentamer staining. The one individual demonstrating cross-reactive T cells to both epitopes showed the most advanced degree of liver disease. In coinfected individuals, we observed a positive correlation between the magnitudes of T-cell responses to both the SL9 and the AL9 epitopes, which was also positively associated with the clinical parameter of liver damage. Thus, we find that <span class="unannotated ">HIV</span> infection induces T cells that can cross-react to heterologous viruses or prime for T cells that are closely related in sequence. However, the induction of cross-reactive T cells may not be associated with control of disease caused by the heterologous <span class="unannotated ">virus</span>. This demonstrates that degeneracy of HIV-specific T cells may play a role in the immunopathology of <span class="match annotated ">HCV</span>/<span class="annotated ">HIV</span> coinfection. 
<h3>21029749</h3>Double-antigen sandwich ELISA for the detection of anti-<span class="annotated ">hepatitis C virus</span> antibodies. <br><br>A double-antigen sandwich ELISA was developed a detection of <span class="match annotated ">HCV</span> antibodies by a recombinant multi-epitope <span class="match annotated ">HCV</span> antigen and a biotin-streptavidin amplification system. Three plasma specimens from 1708 individuals who were suspected previously to be <span class="match annotated ">HCV</span>-positive using an <span class="match annotated ">HCV</span> antibody diagnostic kit (Chuangxin, Xiamen, China) displayed negative results when using the ELISA. These results were validated by a recombinant immunoblotting assay (two were negative, and one was indeterminate). Among 889 blood specimens donated for clinical evaluation, 246 were positive and 630 were negative using the ELISA. The sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA were 98.7% and 100%, respectively. In 43 donors and 14 <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> with chronic hepatitis C, the detectable rates for <span class="match annotated ">HCV</span> IgM by both ELISA and the <span class="match annotated ">HCV</span> anti-IgM detection reagents (Huimin, Shenyang, China) were 100%, and the detectable rate for <span class="match annotated ">HCV</span> IgG using an indirect <span class="match annotated ">HCV</span>-antibody detection kit (GWK, Beijing, China) was 98.3%. Thus, the double-antigen sandwich ELISA exhibits strong specificity and sensitivity and has been approved by the China State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA). The performance of the double-antigen sandwich ELISA was similar to the Ortho ELISA 3.0. It did not give false-negative results otherwise IgM was undetectable using an indirect <span class="match annotated ">HCV</span>-antibody detection kit. This ELISA provides another method for the detection of <span class="match annotated ">HCV</span> antibodies. 
<h3>21034775</h3>Cross-genotypic polyclonal anti-<span class="match annotated ">HCV</span> antibodies from <span class="annotated ">human</span> ascitic fluid.<br><br>Many anti-<span class="match annotated ">HCV</span> antibodies are available, but more are needed for research and clinical applications. This study examines whether ascitic fluid from cirrhotic <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> could be a source of reagent-grade antibodies. Ascitic fluid from 29 <span class="match annotated ">HCV</span> <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> was screened by ELISA for anti-<span class="match annotated ">HCV</span> antibodies against three <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> proteins: core, NS4B, and NS5A. Significant patient-to-patient variability in anti-<span class="match annotated ">HCV</span> antibody titers was observed. Total ascitic fluid IgG purified by Protein-A chromatography reacted with <span class="match annotated ">HCV</span> proteins in immunoblots, cell extracts, and replicon-expressing cells. Affinity-purification using synthetic peptides as bait allowed the preparation of cross-genotypic antibodies directed against pre-selected regions of <span class="match unannotated ">HCV</span> core, NS4B, and NS5A proteins. The performance of the polyclonal antibodies was comparable to that of monoclonal antibodies. Anti-NS4B antibody preparations reacted with genotype 1a, 1b, and 2a NS4B proteins in immunoblots and allowed NS4B to be localized in replicon-expressing cells. Ascitic fluid is an abundant source of <span class="annotated ">human</span> polyclonal cross-genotypic antibodies that can be used as an alternative to blood. This study shows the utility of selectively purifying <span class="annotated ">human</span> polyclonal antibodies from ascitic fluid. Affinity purification allows antibodies to be selected that are comparable to monoclonal antibodies in their ability to react with targeted regions of <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> proteins. 
<h3>20962101</h3><span class="annotated ">Hepatitis C virus</span> NS2 protein serves as a scaffold for <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> assembly by interacting with both structural and nonstructural proteins. <br><br>Many aspects of the assembly of <span class="annotated ">hepatitis C virus</span> (<span class="match annotated ">HCV</span>) remain incompletely understood. To characterize the role of NS2 in the production of infectious <span class="unannotated ">virus</span>, we determined NS2 interaction partners among other <span class="match annotated ">HCV</span> proteins during productive infection. Pulldown assays showed that NS2 forms complexes with both structural and nonstructural proteins, including E1, E2, p7, NS3, and NS5A. Confocal microscopy also demonstrated that NS2 colocalizes with E1, E2, and NS5A in dot-like structures near lipid droplets. However, NS5A did not coprecipitate with E2 and interacted only weakly with NS3 in pulldown assays. Also, there was no demonstrable interaction between p7 and E2 or NS3 in such assays. Therefore, NS2 is uniquely capable of interacting with both structural and nonstructural proteins. Among mutations in p7, NS2, and NS3 that prevent production of infectious <span class="unannotated ">virus</span>, only p7 mutations significantly reduced NS2-mediated protein interactions. These p7 mutations altered the intracellular distribution of NS2 and E2 and appeared to modulate the membrane topology of the C-terminal domain of NS2. These results suggest that NS2 acts to coordinate <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> assembly by mediating interactions between envelope proteins and NS3 and NS5A within replication complexes adjacent to lipid droplets, where <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> particle assembly is thought to occur. p7 may play an accessory role by regulating NS2 membrane topology, which is important for NS2-mediated protein interactions and therefore NS2 function.
