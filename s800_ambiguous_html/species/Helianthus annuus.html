<h2>Helianthus annuus</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20831646</h3>Floret initiation, tissue expansion and carbon availability at the meristem of the <span class="annotated ">sunflower</span> capitulum as affected by water or light deficits. <br><br>* The co-ordination between floret initiation and meristem expansion, and their relationships with carbon availability, were studied and quantified in <span class="annotated ">sunflower</span> (<span class="match annotated ">Helianthus annuus</span>) plants subjected to light or water shortages. * Meristem size, number of floret primordia, primordium size, rate of plant biomass accumulation, leaf area, photosynthetic rate, and soluble sugar content in the capitulum were measured until completion of floret initiation. * Although treatments differentially affected tissue expansion and biomass acquisition, a common relationship between the final number of florets and the rate and duration of meristem expansion was conserved. In the absence of water deficit, changes in relative expansion rate in the meristem paralleled changes in soluble sugar content. Water deficit reduced tissue expansion both in leaves and in the capitulum, and induced the accumulation of soluble sugars in the meristem. Use of these sugars at re-watering was associated with increased meristem growth and higher floret numbers compared with control plants. * Floret initiation and meristem tissue expansion remained strongly co-ordinated under all studied circumstances, and both depended on local carbon availability when water supply was unlimited. Transient water deficits favoured reproductive meristem growth and floret production. Equations accounting for these results constitute a framework for phenotyping the response to drought. 
<h3>21029117</h3>Dynamic changes of canopy-scale mesophyll conductance to CO2 diffusion of flower as affected by CO2 concentration and abscisic acid. <br><br>Leaf-level measurements have shown that mesophyll conductance (g(m)) can vary rapidly in response to CO2 and other environmental factors, but similar studies at the canopy-scale are missing. Here, we report the effect of short-term variation of CO2 concentration on canopy-scale g(m) and other CO2 exchange parameters of <span class="annotated ">sunflower</span> (<span class="match annotated ">Helianthus annuus</span> L.) stands in the presence and absence of abscisic acid (ABA) in their nutrient solution. g(m) was estimated from gas exchange and on-line carbon isotope discrimination (Delta(obs)) in a ^1^3CO2/^1^2CO2) gas exchange mesocosm. The isotopic contribution of (photo)respiration to stand-scale Delta(obs) was determined with the experimental approach of Tcherkez et al. Without ABA, short-term exposures to different CO2 concentrations (C(a) 100 to 900 mumol mol-^1) had little effect on canopy-scale g(m) . But, addition of ABA strongly altered the CO2-response: g(m) was high (approx. 0.5 mol CO2 m-^2 s-^1) at C(a) &lt;200 mumol mol-^1 and decreased to &lt;0.1 mol CO2 m-^2 s-^1 at C(a) >400 mumol mol-^1. In the absence of ABA, the contribution of (photo)respiration to stand-scale Delta(obs) was high at low C(a) (7.2 %) and decreased to &lt;2 % at C(a) > 400 mumol mol-^1. Treatment with ABA halved this effect at all C(a) . 
<h3>22182606</h3>Sunflower stem weevil and its larval parasitoids in native sunflowers: is parasitoid abundance and diversity greater in the u.s. Southwest? <br><br>Classical biological control programs often target a pest's region of origin as a likely source for new biological control agents. Here, we use this approach to search for biological control agents of the <span class="unannotated ">sunflower</span> stem weevil (Cylindrocopturus adspersus LeConte), an economically important pest of commercial <span class="unannotated ">sunflower</span>. We conducted surveys of weevil natural enemy diversity and abundance across a transect running from the northern Great Plains to the southwestern U.S. (the presumed area of endemism of annual <span class="unannotated ">sunflower</span> species in the genus Helianthus). Accordingly, natural enemy diversity and abundance were expected to be greater in the southwestern U.S. C. adspersus and their larval parasitoids were collected from stems of four native <span class="unannotated ">sunflower</span> species (<span class="match annotated ">Helianthus annuus</span>, <span class="annotated ">H. nuttallii</span>, <span class="annotated ">H. pauciflorus</span>, and <span class="annotated ">H. petiolaris</span>) from 147 sites across eight states. Native <span class="annotated ">H. annuus</span> constituted the majority of the <span class="unannotated ">sunflower</span> populations. Mean weevil densities were significantly higher in <span class="unannotated ">sunflower</span> stalks that were larger in diameter. Mean weevil densities within sites did not differ across the range of longitudes and latitudes sampled. After accounting for the effects of stalk diameter and location, weevil densities did not differ among the four <span class="unannotated ">sunflower</span> species nor did they differ as a function of elevation. C. adspersus in <span class="annotated ">H. annuus</span> and <span class="annotated ">H. petiolaris</span> were attacked by seven species of parasitoids. No parasitoids were found attacking C. adspersus in <span class="annotated ">H. nuttallii</span> or <span class="annotated ">H. pauciflorus</span> stalks. C. adspersus were twice as likely to be attacked by a parasitoid when feeding on <span class="annotated ">H. petiolaris</span> than <span class="annotated ">H. annuus</span>. Furthermore, the likelihood that C. adspersus would be parasitized decreased with increasing elevation and increasing stem diameters. All parasitoid species have been previously reported attacking C. adspersus larvae in cultivated <span class="unannotated ">sunflower</span>. Species richness was less diverse in these collections than from previous studies of cultivated <span class="unannotated ">sunflower</span>. Our findings suggest that the species of larval parasitoids attacking C. adspersus in native sunflowers have successfully made the transition to cultivated <span class="unannotated ">sunflower</span>.
