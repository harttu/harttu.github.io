<h2>human influenza virus A</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21034773</h3>Comparison of commercial systems for extraction of nucleic acids from DNA/RNA respiratory pathogens. <br><br>This study compared six automated nucleic acid extraction systems and one manual kit for their ability to recover nucleic acids from <span class="annotated ">human</span> nasal wash specimens spiked with five respiratory pathogens, representing Gram-positive bacteria (<span class="annotated ">Streptococcus pyogenes</span>), Gram-negative bacteria (<span class="annotated ">Legionella pneumophila</span>), DNA viruses (adenovirus), segmented RNA viruses (<span class="match annotated ">human influenza virus A</span>), and non-segmented RNA viruses (<span class="annotated ">respiratory syncytial virus</span>). The robots and kit evaluated represent major commercially available methods that are capable of simultaneous extraction of DNA and RNA from respiratory specimens, and included platforms based on magnetic-bead technology (KingFisher mL, Biorobot EZ1, easyMAG, KingFisher Flex, and MagNA Pure Compact) or glass fiber filter technology (Biorobot MDX and the manual kit Allprep). All methods yielded extracts free of cross-contamination and RT-PCR inhibition. All automated systems recovered <span class="annotated ">L. pneumophila</span> and <span class="unannotated ">adenovirus</span> DNA equivalently. However, the MagNA Pure protocol demonstrated more than 4-fold higher DNA recovery from the <span class="annotated ">S. pyogenes</span> than other methods. The KingFisher mL and easyMAG protocols provided 1- to 3-log wider linearity and extracted 3- to 4-fold more RNA from the <span class="annotated ">human influenza virus</span> and <span class="annotated ">respiratory syncytial virus</span>. These findings suggest that systems differed in nucleic acid recovery, reproducibility, and linearity in a pathogen specific manner.
