SI__tricuspis and SB__P SI__. SI__curvatus , rapidly expand across imported <b>fire ant</b> populations in the southeastern United States . 
</br>
Natural enemies of the imported fire ants , SB__Solenopsis SI__invicta SI__Buren SB__S SI__. SI__richteri SI__Forel ( Hymenoptera : Formicidae ) , and their hybrid , include a suite of more than 20 <b>fire ant</b> decapitating phorid flies from South America in the genus Pseudacteon . 
</br>
In the fall of 2008 , eleven years after the first successful release , we estimate that SB__P SI__. SI__tricuspis covered about 50 % of the <b>fire ant</b> quarantined area and that it will occur in almost 65 % of the quarantine area by 2011 . 
</br>
Complete coverage of the <b>fire ant</b> quarantined area will be delayed or limited by this species ' slow rate of spread and frequent failure to establish in more northerly portions of the <b>fire ant</b> range and also , perhaps , by its preference for SB__red SI__imported SI__fire SI__ants ( SB__S SI__. SI__invicta ) . 
</br>
Eight years after the first successful release of SB__P SI__. SI__curvatus , two biotypes of this species ( one biotype occurring predominantly in the SB__black and hybrid imported fire ants and the other occurring in SB__red SI__imported SI__fire SI__ants ) covered almost 60 % of the <b>fire ant</b> quarantined area . 
</br>
The organization of foraging in the <b>fire ant</b> , SB__Solenopsis SI__invicta . 
</br>
The experiments and observations in this paper reveal in broad strokes how colonies of the <b>fire ant</b> , SB__Solenopsis SI__invicta Buren ( SB__Hymenoptera : Formicidae ) , allocate their available labor to foraging , how they disperse that force within their territory , and how this force changes with colony size , season and worker age . 
</br>
To elucidate the role of the IIS pathway in the <b>fire ant</b> , two putative insulin receptors ( SiInR - 1 and SiInR - 2 ) were cloned ; the first InR cDNAs cloned from social insects . 
</br>
Here , the pattern and range of movement of a <b>fire ant</b> parasitoid , SB__Pseudacteon SI__tricuspis Borgmeier , was investigated by performing a series of mass - release - resighting experiments . 
</br>
Data from this assessment of the short term redistribution pattern of SB__P SI__. SI__tricuspis could be useful in determining proximity of releases of this , and other <b>fire ant</b> parasitoids .
