<h2>MCCC 1A05965</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20118285</h3><span class="annotated ">Serinicoccus profundi sp. nov.</span>, an actinomycete isolated from deep-sea sediment, and emended description of the genus Serinicoccus. <br><br>A Gram-reaction-positive bacterial strain of the genus Serinicoccus, designated <span class="match annotated ">MCCC 1A05965</span>(T), was isolated from a deep-sea (5368 m) sediment of the Indian Ocean. Comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the isolate shared 97.6 % sequence similarity with <span class="annotated ">Serinicoccus marinus</span> JC1078(T), the type strain of the only described species of the genus Serinicoccus. The DNA-DNA relatedness between these two strains was 46.2 % (standard deviation 1.86 %). The cell wall contained alanine, glycine, serine, l-ornithine and glutamic acid, which corresponds to the description of the genus Serinicoccus. The acyl type of the glycan chain of the peptidoglycan was glycolyl. Other characteristics of strain <span class="match annotated ">MCCC 1A05965</span>(T) were consistent with those of the genus Serinicoccus. Cells were coccoid, moderately halophilic, oxidase-negative, catalase-positive and non-spore-forming. The major menaquinone was MK-8(H(4)). The predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C(15 : 0) (34.7 %) and iso-C(16 : 0) (17.0 %). The polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol and an unknown glycolipid. The DNA G+C content was 72 mol%. Strain <span class="match annotated ">MCCC 1A05965</span>(T) (=0714S6-1(T) =DSM 21363(T) =CGMCC 4.5582(T)) is assigned as the type strain of a novel species, for which the name <span class="annotated ">Serinicoccus profundi sp. nov</span><span class="unannotated ">Serinicoccus profundi sp. nov.</span> is proposed.
