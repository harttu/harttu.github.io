<h2>Paracoccidioides brasiliensis</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20682355</h3>PRP8 intein in Ajellomycetaceae family pathogens: sequence analysis, splicing evaluation and homing endonuclease activity. 

Inteins are intervening sequences that are transcribed and translated with flanking host protein sequences and then self-excised by protein splicing. Bi-functional inteins also contain a homing endonuclease responsible for their genetic mobility. The PRP8 intein, the most widespread among fungi, occurs in important pathogens such as <span class="yellow">Histoplasma capsulatum</span> and <span class="blue">Paracoccidioides brasiliensis</span>, from the Ajellomycetaceae family. Herein, we describe the bi-functional PRP8 intein in two other Ajellomycetacean pathogens, <span class="yellow">Blastomyces dermatitidis</span> and <span class="yellow">Emmonsia parva</span>. Sequence analysis and experimental evidence suggest that the homing endonuclease from PbrPRP8 is inactive. The splicing activity of the PRP8 intein from the <span class="yellow">B. dermatitidis</span>, <span class="yellow">E. parva</span> and <span class="yellow">P. brasiliensis species complex</span> was demonstrated in a non-native protein context in <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span>. Since the PRP8 intein is located in a functionally essential nuclear protein, it can be considered a promising therapeutic target for anti-fungal drugs, because inhibition of intein splicing should inhibit proliferation of intein-containing pathogens. 
<h3>21945996</h3>Differential PbP27 expression in the <span class="yellow">yeast</span> and mycelial forms of the <span class="blue">Paracoccidioides brasiliensis</span> species complex. 

p27 is an antigenic protein produced by <span class="blue">Paracoccidioides brasiliensis</span>, the etiologic agent of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM). Despite its unknown function, it has been suggested as a putative virulence factor, proposed as a suitable target for the design of diagnostic tools and vaccines, and considered as an enhancer in antifungal treatment of PCM. We evaluated sequence polymorphisms of PbP27 gene sequence among isolates, finding some polymorphisms associated with the isolates' phylogenetic origin. In order to determine if there was a differential expression pattern between morphological states and among isolates, we also evaluated PbP27 expression, at transcriptional and translational levels, in mycelia and <span class="yellow">yeast</span> cultures in 14 isolates belonging to the <span class="yellow">P. brasiliensis species complex</span> (S1, PS2, PS3, and "Pb01-like", proposed to be named <span class="yellow">Paracoccidioides lutzii</span>) by two techniques, real time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) and protein dot blot. For the latter, four protein extracts from different cell localizations (SDS or Beta-mercaptoethanol, cytoplasmic and extracellular proteins) were analyzed for each isolate. p27 was present in the four extracts evaluated, mainly in the SDS extract, corresponding to an extract containing proteins loosely attached to the cell wall. This information correlates with immunohistochemical analysis, where positive staining of the yeasts' cell wall was observed. We found that p27 was present in all isolates, mainly in the <span class="yellow">yeast</span> form. This pattern was corroborated by RT-qPCR results, with higher expression levels found in the <span class="yellow">yeast</span> form for most of the isolates. The results provide new insights into the expression patterns of this protein, and further characterize it in view of potential uses as a diagnostic and/or therapeutic tool.
