<h2>rats</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20962092</h3>Induction of type I interferon secretion through recombinant <span class="annotated ">Newcastle disease virus</span> expressing <span class="annotated ">measles virus</span> hemagglutinin stimulates antibody secretion in the presence of maternal antibodies. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Measles virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">MV</span>) vaccine effectively protects seronegative individuals against infection. However, inhibition of vaccine-induced seroconversion by maternal antibodies after vaccination remains a problem, as it leaves <span class="linneaus_only ">infants</span> susceptible to <span class="annotated ">MV</span> infection. In <span class="unannotated ">cotton</span> <span class="match linneaus_only ">rats</span>, passive transfer of <span class="annotated ">MV</span>-specific IgG mimics maternal antibodies and inhibits vaccine-induced seroconversion. Here, we report that immunization in the presence of passively transferred IgG inhibits the secretion of neutralizing antibodies but not the generation of <span class="annotated ">MV</span>-specific B cells. This finding suggested that <span class="annotated ">MV</span>-specific B cells require an additional stimulus to mature into antibody-secreting plasma cells. In order to provide such a stimulus, we generated a recombinant <span class="annotated ">Newcastle disease virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">NDV</span>) expressing the <span class="annotated ">MV</span> hemagglutinin (<span class="annotated ">NDV-H</span>). In contrast to <span class="annotated ">MV</span>, <span class="annotated ">NDV-H</span> induced high levels of type I interferon in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and in lung tissue. In <span class="unannotated ">cotton</span> <span class="match linneaus_only ">rats</span> immunized with <span class="annotated ">NDV-H</span>, neutralizing antibodies were also generated in the presence of passively transferred antibodies. In the latter case, however, the level and kinetics of antibody generation were reduced. In vitro, alpha interferon stimulated the activation of <span class="annotated ">MV</span>-specific B cells from <span class="annotated ">MV</span>-immune spleen cells. <span class="annotated ">NDV</span> infection (which induces alpha interferon) had the same effect, and stimulation could be abrogated by antibodies neutralizing alpha interferon, but not interleukin 6 (IL-6). In vivo, coapplication of UV-inactivated <span class="annotated ">MV</span> with <span class="annotated ">NDV</span> led to increased <span class="annotated ">MV</span>-specific antibody production in the presence and absence of passively transferred antibodies. These data indicate that <span class="annotated ">MV</span>-specific B cells are being generated after immunization in the presence of maternal antibodies and that the provision of alpha interferon as an additional signal leads to antibody secretion. 
<h3>21498113</h3>New insights into the excystation process and oocyst morphology of <span class="linneaus_only ">rodent</span> Eimeria species. <br><br>In this study, the mechanism of excystation of the <span class="linneaus_only ">rodent</span> parasites <span class="annotated ">Eimeria nieschulzi</span>, from <span class="match linneaus_only ">rats</span>, and <span class="annotated ">Eimeria falciformis</span>, from <span class="unannotated ">mice</span>, was investigated. In vitro, oocysts of both species are susceptible to the protease pepsin, and sporocysts and sporozoites can be excysted in a similar way. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed a collapse of the oocysts wall at both polar ends after pepsin treatment. This occurs without any visible damage of the outer wall. Using fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) we observed that pepsin enters sporulated oocysts at both polar ends and causes degradation of the inner oocyst wall. Using scanning electron microscopy we could identify two polar caps in both investigated <span class="linneaus_only ">rodent</span> Eimeria species, but only one is harbouring the micropyle. Thus the polar caps are the entry site for the pepsin. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the oocyst cap and micropyle are functionally different structures. This study complements the morphological description of both Eimeria species and is of relevance for other coccidian species.
