<h2>E1162</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21148730</h3>The recombinase IntA is required for excision of esp-containing ICEEfm1 in <span class="annotated ">Enterococcus faecium</span>. <br><br>Comparative genome analysis of <span class="annotated ">Enterococcus faecium</span> recently revealed that a genomic island containing the esp gene, referred to as the esp-containing pathogenicity island (esp PAI), can be transferred by conjugation and contains a partial Tn916-like element and an integrase gene, intA. Here, we characterize the role of intA in the excision of the esp PAI. An intA insertion-deletion mutant in <span class="annotated ">E. faecium E1162</span> (<span class="match annotated ">E1162</span>DeltaintA) was constructed and in trans complemented with wild-type intA (<span class="match annotated ">E1162</span>DeltaintA::pEF30). Circular intermediates (CI) of excised esp PAI were determined using inverse PCR analysis on purified chromosomal DNA from strains <span class="match unannotated ">E1162</span>, E1162Deltaesp, E1162DeltaintA, and E1162DeltaintA::pEF30. In <span class="match unannotated ">E1162</span> and E1162Deltaesp, CI of the esp PAI were detected. No CI were detected in E1162DeltaintA, while in the complemented strain E1162DeltaintA::pEF30 CI formation was restored, indicating that intA is essential for excision and subsequent mobilization of the esp-containing genomic island in <span class="annotated ">E. faecium</span>. Based on the fact that this island can be mobilized and is self-transmissible, we propose to change the name of the esp PAI to ICEEfm1.
