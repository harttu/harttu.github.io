</br>
H1pdm , <b>H1</b> , and H3 rRT - PCR assays were evaluated using in vitro - transcribed control RNA , isolated viruses , and other respiratory pathogenic viruses , and were shown to have high sensitivity , good linearity ( R ( 2 ) = 0 . 99 ) , and high specificity . 
</br>
The present results suggest that these highly sensitive and specific H1pdm , <b>H1</b> , and H3 rRT - PCR assays are useful not only for diagnosing SB__influenza SI__viruses , but also for the surveillance of SB__influenza SI__viruses .
