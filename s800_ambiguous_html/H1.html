<h2>H1</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20980523</h3>T cell-mediated protection against <span class="annotated ">lethal 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus</span> infection in a <span class="unannotated ">mouse</span> model. <br><br>Genetic mutation and reassortment of <span class="annotated ">influenza virus</span> gene segments, in particular those of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), that lead to antigenic drift and shift are the major strategies for <span class="annotated ">influenza virus</span> to escape preexisting immunity. The most recent example of such phenomena is the first pandemic of <span class="annotated ">H1N1 influenza</span> of the 21st century, which started in 2009. Cross-reactive antibodies raised against <span class="annotated ">H1N1 viruses</span> circulating before 1930 show protective activity against the <span class="annotated ">2009 pandemic virus</span>. Cross-reactive T-cell responses can also contribute to protection, but in vivo support of this view is lacking. To explore the protection mechanisms in vivo, we primed <span class="unannotated ">mice</span> with <span class="match annotated ">H1</span> and <span class="annotated ">H3 influenza virus</span> isolates and rechallenged them with a <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> derived from the <span class="annotated ">2009 H1N1 A/CA/04/09 virus</span>, named CA/E3/09. We found that priming with <span class="unannotated ">influenza viruses</span> of both <span class="match annotated ">H1</span> and H3 homo- and heterosubtypes protected against lethal CA/E3/09 <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> challenge. Convalescent-phase sera from these primed <span class="unannotated ">mice</span> conferred no neutralization activity in vitro and no protection in vivo. However, T-cell depletion studies suggested that both CD4 and CD8 T cells contributed to the protection. Taken together, these results indicate that cross-reactive T cells established after initial priming with distally related viruses can be a vital component for prevention of disease and control of <span class="annotated ">pandemic H1N1 influenza virus</span> infection. Our results highlight the importance of establishing cross-reactive T-cell responses for protecting against existing or newly emerging pandemic <span class="unannotated ">influenza viruses</span>. 
<h3>21029748</h3>One-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR assays for detecting and subtyping <span class="annotated ">pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009</span>, <span class="annotated ">seasonal influenza A/H1N1</span>, and <span class="annotated ">seasonal influenza A/H3N2 viruses</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 (A/H1N1pdm) virus</span> has caused significant outbreaks worldwide. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> previous one-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) assay for detecting <span class="annotated ">A/H1N1pdm virus</span> (H1pdm rRT-PCR assay) was improved since the former probe had a low melting temperature and low tolerance to <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> mutation. To help with the screening of the <span class="annotated ">A/H1N1pdm virus</span>, rRT-PCR assays were also developed for detecting <span class="annotated ">human</span> <span class="annotated ">seasonal A/H1N1</span> (H1 rRT-PCR assay) and <span class="annotated ">A/H3N2 influenza viruses</span> (H3 rRT-PCR assay). H1pdm, <span class="match unannotated ">H1</span>, and H3 rRT-PCR assays were evaluated using in vitro-transcribed control RNA, isolated viruses, and other respiratory pathogenic viruses, and were shown to have high sensitivity, good linearity (R(2)=0.99), and high specificity. In addition, the improved H1pdm rRT-PCR assay could detect two <span class="annotated ">viral strains of A/H1N1pdm</span>, namely, <span class="annotated ">A/Aichi/472/2009 (H1N1)pdm</span> and <span class="annotated ">A/Sakai/89/2009 (H1N1)pdm</span>, which have mutation(s) in the probe-binding region of the hemagglutinin gene, without loss of sensitivity. Using the three rRT-PCR assays developed, 90 clinical specimens collected between May and October 2009 were then tested. Of these, 26, 20, and 2 samples were identified as positive for <span class="annotated ">A/H1pdm</span>, <span class="annotated ">A/H3</span>, and <span class="annotated ">A/H1</span>, respectively, while 42 samples were negative for <span class="annotated ">influenza A viruses</span>. The present results suggest that these highly sensitive and specific H1pdm, <span class="match unannotated ">H1</span>, and H3 rRT-PCR assays are useful not only for diagnosing <span class="annotated ">influenza viruses</span>, but also for the surveillance of <span class="annotated ">influenza viruses</span>.
