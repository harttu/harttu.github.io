<h2>coxsackievirus B3</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21029747</h3>A fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based fluorometer assay for screening anti-<span class="blue">coxsackievirus B3</span> compounds. 

In view of the need to develop a simple and rapid method to screen for antiviral therapeutic agents, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based reporter system consisting of engineered mammalian cells expressing a cyan fluorescent protein-yellow fluorescent protein (CFP-YFP) pair linked by a short peptide containing the cleavage site of <span class="yellow">viral</span> protease 2A (2A(pro)) was developed. By detecting the 2A(pro) produced early during the <span class="yellow">virus</span> infection cycle, the CFP-YFP pair effectively identifies infectious <span class="blue">coxsackievirus B3</span> (<span class="yellow">CVB3</span>), a picornavirus that causes <span class="yellow">viral</span> myocarditis in <span class="yellow">humans</span>. The reporter system was used to screen a library of 2000 drugs and natural products for potential antiviral compounds. The reporter cells were treated with the test compounds, challenged with <span class="yellow">CVB3</span>, and then examined using a fluorometer at 24h post-infection. Sixty-four compounds, mostly therapeutic drugs, antimicrobial compounds and compounds with unknown functions, caused at least 50% inhibition of 2A(pro) activity. Three known antiviral compounds, cosmosiin, ribavirin and baicalein, were also identified in the screening. The developed method is an effective strategy for rapid screening, and identifies compounds that inhibit <span class="yellow">CVB3</span> 2A(pro). This method should be a valuable aid in the antiviral drug discovery effort.
