<h2>Sarcophaga crassipalpis</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21711401</h3>Identification and characterization of the cysteine protease inhibitor gene MdCPI from <span class="yellow">Musca domestica</span>. <br><br>Cysteine proteinase inhibitors (CPIs) are involved in many vital cellular processes such as signalling pathways, apoptosis, immune response and development; however, no CPIs have yet been reported from the <span class="yellow">housefly</span> <span class="yellow">Musca domestica</span>. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a <span class="yellow">housefly</span> CPI gene designated MdCPI. The gene contains an open reading frame of 357 bp encoding a protein of 118 amino acid residues with a putative signal peptide of 17 amino acid residues. Protein alignment demonstrated a high homology to that of <span class="blue">Sarcophaga crassipalpis</span> (identity = 51%). Phylogenetic analysis suggested that all CPIs from dipterans, including the <span class="yellow">housefly</span>, belong to the I25A family and may be descended from a single common ancestor. The gene was expressed in and purified from <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span>. Biochemical studies showed that MdCPI exerts an inhibiting function on papain, which is a classical assay to confirm CPIs. Real-time quantitative PCR and immunolocalization analysis revealed that MdCPI is specifically expressed in haemocytes and fat bodies. It is highly down-regulated in larvae and markedly up-regulated in the pupal stage, suggesting that it may be related to development.
