<h2>Lassa virus</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20980514</h3>Domain structure of <span class="match annotated ">Lassa virus</span> L protein.<br><br>The 200-kDa L protein of arenaviruses plays a central role in <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> genome replication and transcription. This study aimed at providing evidence for the domain structure of L protein by combining bioinformatics with a stepwise mutagenesis approach using the <span class="match annotated ">Lassa virus</span> minireplicon system. Potential interdomain linkers were predicted using various algorithms. The prediction was challenged by insertion of flexible sequences into the predicted linkers. Insertion of 5 or 10 amino acid residues was tolerated at seven sites (S407, G446, G467, G774, G939, S1952, and V2074 in <span class="annotated ">Lassa virus AV</span>). At two of these sites, G467 and G939, L protein could be split into an N-terminal and a C-terminal part, which were able to trans-complement each other and reconstitute a functional complex upon coexpression. Coimmunoprecipitation studies revealed physical interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains, irrespective of whether L protein was split at G467 or G939. In confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, the N-terminal domains showed a dot-like, sometimes perinuclear, cytoplasmic distribution similar to that of full-length L protein, while the C-terminal domains were homogenously distributed in cytoplasm. The latter were redistributed into the dot-like structures upon coexpression with the corresponding N-terminal domain. In conclusion, this study demonstrates two interdomain linkers in <span class="match annotated ">Lassa virus</span> L protein, at G467 and G939, suggesting that L protein is composed of at least three structural domains spanning residues 1 to 467, 467 to 939, and 939 to 2220. The first domain seems to mediate accumulation of L protein into cytoplasmic dot-like structures. 
<h3>20980515</h3>Reverse genetics generation of chimeric infectious Junin/Lassa <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> is dependent on interaction of homologous glycoprotein stable signal peptide and G2 cytoplasmic domains. <br><br>The Arenaviridae are a diverse and globally distributed collection of viruses that are maintained primarily by <span class="linneaus_only ">rodent</span> reservoirs. <span class="annotated ">Junin virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">JUNV</span>) and <span class="match annotated ">Lassa virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">LASV</span>) can both cause significant outbreaks of severe and often fatal <span class="annotated ">human</span> disease throughout their respective areas of endemicity. In an effort to improve upon the existing live attenuated <span class="annotated ">JUNV</span> Candid1 vaccine, we generated a genetically homogenous stock of this <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> from cDNA copies of the <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> S and L segments by using a reverse genetics system. Further, these cDNAs were used in combination with <span class="annotated ">LASV</span> cDNAs to successfully generate two recombinant Candid1 <span class="annotated ">JUNV</span>/<span class="annotated ">LASV</span> chimeric viruses (via envelope glycoprotein [GPC] exchange). It was found that while the GPC extravirion domains were readily exchangeable, homologous stable signal peptide (SSP) and G2 transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail domains were essential for correct GPC maturation and production of infectious chimeric viruses. The switching of the <span class="annotated ">JUNV</span> and <span class="annotated ">LASV</span> G1/G2 ectodomains within the Candid1 vaccine background did not alter the attenuated phenotype of the vaccine strain in a lethal <span class="annotated ">mouse</span> model. These recombinant chimeric viruses shed light on the fundamental requirements of arenavirus GPC maturation and may serve as a strategy for the development of bivalent <span class="annotated ">JUNV</span> and <span class="annotated ">LASV</span> vaccine candidates.
