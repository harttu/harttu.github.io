<h2>DSM 18155(T)</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20173005</h3><span class="annotated ">Thiomonas islandica</span> sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic, hydrogen- and sulfur-oxidizing <span class="annotated ">betaproteobacterium</span> isolated from a hot spring. <br><br>A novel, hydrogen- and sulfur-oxidizing bacterium, designated strain <span class="annotated ">6C(T)</span>, was isolated from a hot spring in Graendalur, south-western Iceland. Cells of this organism were Gram-reaction-negative, rod-shaped and motile. The strain grew aerobically and was capable of chemolithotrophic growth on thiosulfate and hydrogen, heterotrophic growth on pyruvate, oxalate, acetate and on glutamate in the presence of <span class="unannotated ">yeast</span> extract and mixotrophic growth on several organic compounds, thiosulfate and/or hydrogen. During growth on thiosulfate, the final product was sulfate, resulting in a drop in pH from 6.8 to 2.7. Heterotrophic growth on pyruvate was observed at pH 4-7 (optimum pH 4) and 35-50 ^0C (optimum 45 ^0C). The DNA G+C content was 65.2 mol%. As determined by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain <span class="annotated ">6C(T)</span> represents a distinct species belonging to the class <span class="annotated ">Betaproteobacteria</span> and is most closely related to <span class="annotated ">Thiomonas intermedia</span> <span class="match annotated ">DSM 18155(T)</span> and <span class="annotated ">Thiomonas perometabolis</span> <span class="annotated ">DSM 18570(T)</span>. DNA-DNA hybridization between strain <span class="annotated ">6C(T)</span> and <span class="annotated ">Thiomonas intermedia</span> <span class="match annotated ">DSM 18155(T)</span> and <span class="annotated ">Thiomonas perometabolis</span> <span class="annotated ">DSM 18570(T)</span> gave relatedness values below 32 %. These results, together with physiological characteristics, showed that strain <span class="annotated ">6C(T)</span> represents a novel species within the genus Thiomonas, for which the name <span class="annotated ">Thiomonas islandica</span> sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is <span class="annotated ">6C(T)</span> (=<span class="annotated ">DSM 21436(T)</span> =<span class="annotated ">JCM 16107(T)</span>).
