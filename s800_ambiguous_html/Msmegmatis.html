<h2>M. smegmatis</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20971904</h3>Functional analysis of molybdopterin biosynthesis in mycobacteria identifies a fused molybdopterin synthase in <span class="yellow">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</span>. <br><br>Most mycobacterial species possess a full complement of genes for the biosynthesis of molybdenum cofactor (MoCo). However, a distinguishing feature of members of the <span class="yellow">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</span> complex is their possession of multiple homologs associated with the first two steps of the MoCo biosynthetic pathway. <span class="yellow">A</span> mutant of <span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span> lacking the moaA1-moaD1 gene cluster and a derivative in which moaD2 was also deleted were significantly impaired for growth in media containing nitrate as a sole nitrogen source, indicating a reduced availability of MoCo to support the assimilatory function of the MoCo-dependent nitrate reductase, NarGHI. However, the double mutant displayed residual respiratory nitrate reductase activity, suggesting that it retains the capacity to produce MoCo. The <span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span> moaD and moaE homologs were further analyzed by expressing these genes in mutant strains of <span class="blue">M. smegmatis</span> that lacked one or both of the sole molybdopterin (MPT) synthase-encoding genes, moaD2 and moaE2, and were unable to grow on nitrate, presumably as a result of the loss of MoCo-dependent nitrate assimilatory activity. Expression of <span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span> moaD2 in the <span class="blue">M. smegmatis</span> moaD2 mutant and of <span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span> moaE1 or moaE2 in the <span class="blue">M. smegmatis</span> moaE2 mutant restored nitrate assimilation, confirming the functionality of these genes in MPT synthesis. Expression of <span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span> moaX also restored MoCo biosynthesis in <span class="blue">M. smegmatis</span> mutants lacking moaD2, moaE2, or both, thus identifying MoaX as a fused MPT synthase. By implicating multiple synthase-encoding homologs in MoCo biosynthesis, these results suggest that important cellular functions may be served by their expansion in <span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span>.
