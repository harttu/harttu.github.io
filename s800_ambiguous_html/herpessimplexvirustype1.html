<h2>herpes simplex virus type 1</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20962082</h3>The alphaherpesvirus US3/ORF66 protein kinases direct phosphorylation of the nuclear matrix protein matrin 3. <br><br>The protein kinase found in the short region of alphaherpesviruses, termed US3 in <span class="match annotated ">herpes simplex virus type 1</span> (<span class="annotated ">HSV-1</span>) and <span class="annotated ">pseudorabies virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">PRV</span>) and ORF66 in <span class="annotated ">varicella-zoster virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">VZV</span>), affects several <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> and host cell processes, and its specific targets remain an area of active investigation. Reports suggesting that <span class="annotated ">HSV-1</span> US3 substrates overlap with those of cellular protein kinase <span class="unannotated ">A</span> (PKA) prompted the use of an antibody specific for phosphorylated PKA substrates to identify US3/ORF66 targets. <span class="annotated ">HSV-1</span>, <span class="annotated ">VZV</span>, and <span class="annotated ">PRV</span> induced very different substrate profiles that were US3/ORF66 kinase dependent. The predominant <span class="annotated ">VZV</span>-phosphorylated 125-kDa species was identified as matrin 3, one of the major nuclear matrix proteins. Matrin 3 was also phosphorylated by <span class="annotated ">HSV-1</span> and <span class="annotated ">PRV</span> in a US3 kinase-dependent manner and by <span class="annotated ">VZV</span> ORF66 kinase at a novel residue (KRRRT150EE). Since <span class="annotated ">VZV</span>-directed T150 phosphorylation was not blocked by PKA inhibitors and was not induced by PKA activation, and since PKA predominantly targeted matrin 3 S188, it was concluded that phosphorylation by <span class="annotated ">VZV</span> was PKA independent. However, purified <span class="annotated ">VZV</span> ORF66 kinase did not phosphorylate matrin 3 in vitro, suggesting that additional cellular factors were required. In <span class="annotated ">VZV</span>-infected cells in the absence of the ORF66 kinase, matrin 3 displayed intranuclear changes, while matrin 3 showed a pronounced cytoplasmic distribution in late-stage cells infected with US3-negative <span class="annotated ">HSV-1</span> or <span class="annotated ">PRV</span>. This work identifies phosphorylation of the nuclear matrix protein matrin 3 as a new conserved target of this kinase group. 
<h3>20980505</h3>Translational control of the abundance of cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein in <span class="annotated ">human cytomegalovirus</span>-infected cells. <br><br>Irrespective of their effects on ongoing host protein synthesis, productive replication of the representative alphaherpesvirus <span class="match annotated ">herpes simplex virus type 1</span>, the representative gammaherpesvirus <span class="annotated ">Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus</span>, and the representative betaherpesvirus <span class="annotated ">human cytomegalovirus</span> [<span class="annotated ">HCMV</span>] stimulates the assembly of the multisubunit, cap-binding translation factor eIF4F. However, only <span class="annotated ">HCMV</span> replication is associated with an increased abundance of eIF4F core components (eIF4E, eIF4G, eIF4A) and the eIF4F-associated factor poly(A) binding protein (PABP). Here, we demonstrate that the increase in translation factor concentration was readily detected in an asynchronous population of <span class="annotated ">HCMV</span>-infected primary <span class="annotated ">human</span> fibroblasts, abolished by prior UV inactivation of <span class="unannotated ">virus</span>, and genetically dependent upon <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> immediate-early genes. Strikingly, while increased mRNA steady-state levels accompanied the rise in eIF4E and eIF4G protein levels, the overall abundance of PABP mRNA, together with the half-life of the polypeptide it encodes, remained relatively unchanged by <span class="annotated ">HCMV</span> infection. Instead, <span class="annotated ">HCMV</span>-induced PABP accumulation resulted from new protein synthesis and was sensitive to the mTORC1-selective inhibitor rapamycin, which interferes with phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrate p70 S6K and the translational repressor 4E-BP1. While virus-induced PABP accumulation did not require p70 S6K, it was inhibited by the expression of a dominant-acting 4E-BP1 variant unable to be inactivated by mTORC1. Finally, unlike the situation in alpha- or gammaherpesvirus-infected cells, where PABP is redistributed to nuclei, PABP accumulated in the cytoplasm of <span class="annotated ">HCMV</span>-infected cells. Thus, cytoplasmic PABP accumulation is translationally controlled in <span class="annotated ">HCMV</span>-infected cells via a mechanism requiring mTORC1-mediated inhibition of the cellular 4E-BP1 translational repressor.
