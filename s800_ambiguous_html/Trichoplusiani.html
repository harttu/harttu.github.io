<h2>Trichoplusia ni</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21199020</h3>Genetic analysis of the xenobiotic resistance-associated ABC gene subfamilies of the Lepidoptera. <br><br>Some ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters of subfamilies B, C and G confer resistance to xenobiotics including insecticides. We identified genes of these subfamilies expressed by the lepidopterans <span class="match annotated ">Trichoplusia ni</span> and <span class="annotated ">Bombyx mori</span>. The <span class="annotated ">B. mori</span> genome includes eight, six and 13 ABC-B, -C and -G genes, respectively, which encode P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance protein, MRP, and breast cancer resistance protein, BCRP, homologues. Among the ABC-C and -G subfamilies, gene duplication contributes to protein diversity. We have identified three ABC-B and two ABC-C <span class="annotated ">T. ni</span> genes. Analyses of the <span class="annotated ">T. ni</span> MRP (TrnMRP) revealed unique features, including the potential for TrnMRP4 hyperglycosylation and the alternative splicing of TrnMRP1. Taken together, these attributes of <span class="linneaus_only ">moth</span> multidrug resistance-associated ABCs may confer distinct functional capacities to xenobiotic efflux. 
<h3>21477200</h3><span class="annotated ">Baculovirus</span> cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyases show a close relationship with lepidopteran host homologues. <br><br>Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) photolyases repair ultraviolet (UV)-induced DNA damage using blue light. To get insight in the origin of <span class="annotated ">baculovirus</span> CPD photolyase (phr) genes, homologues in the lepidopteran insects <span class="annotated ">Chrysodeixis chalcites</span>, <span class="annotated ">Spodoptera exigua</span> and <span class="match annotated ">Trichoplusia ni</span> were identified and characterized. Lepidopteran and <span class="annotated ">baculovirus</span> phr genes each form a monophyletic group, and together form a well-supported clade within the insect photolyases. This suggests that <span class="annotated ">baculoviruses</span> obtained their phr genes from an ancestral lepidopteran insect host. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> likely evolutionary scenario is that a granulovirus, <span class="annotated ">Spodoptera litura GV</span> or a direct ancestor, obtained a phr gene. Subsequently, it was horizontally transferred from this granulovirus to several group II nucleopolyhedroviruses (NPVs), including those that infect noctuids of the Plusiinae subfamily.
