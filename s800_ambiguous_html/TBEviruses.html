<h2>TBE viruses</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20933016</h3>Detection and differentiation of <span class="annotated ">tick-borne encephalitis virus</span> subtypes by a reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR and pyrosequencing. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus</span> causes one of the most important flaviviral infections of the <span class="annotated ">human</span> central nervous system in Europe and Asia. In recent years the rate of <span class="annotated ">TBE</span> infection has been raising and the <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> has been spreading to new areas. Currently, the diagnosis of <span class="annotated ">TBE</span> is based on detection of specific antibodies in patients' sera which appear as late as about 2 weeks post-infection. For a timely diagnosis of <span class="annotated ">TBE virus</span> infections and epidemiological studies, a <span class="annotated ">TBE virus</span>-specific reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) followed by pyrosequencing was developed. The assay is based on one degenerated primer pair detecting all three <span class="annotated ">human</span>-pathogenic <span class="annotated ">TBE virus</span> subtypes with a detection limit of 10 copies. Even though primers and probe are highly degenerated, the assay is specific for <span class="annotated ">TBE virus</span> species and detects all subtypes with a comparable sensitivity. Furthermore, <span class="annotated ">TBE virus</span> RT-qPCR could be carried out as one-step or two-step assay. RT-qPCR can be followed by pyrosequencing which allows a rapid subtyping of <span class="match annotated ">TBE viruses</span>. For detection purposes an internal control to monitor RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and amplification is included. In summary, the method is sensitive, highly specific and easy-to-handle tool for the detection and differentiation of <span class="annotated ">TBE virus</span> in the early phase of illness or in <span class="annotated ">TBE</span> host animal species and ticks.
