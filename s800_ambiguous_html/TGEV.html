<h2>TGEV</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21047955</h3>Alphacoronavirus <span class="yellow">transmissible gastroenteritis virus</span> nsp1 protein suppresses protein translation in mammalian cells and in cell-free HeLa cell extracts but not in <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> reticulocyte lysate. 

The nsp1 protein of <span class="yellow">transmissible gastroenteritis virus</span> (<span class="blue">TGEV</span>), an alphacoronavirus, efficiently suppressed protein synthesis in mammalian cells. Unlike the nsp1 protein of <span class="yellow">severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus</span>, a betacoronavirus, the <span class="blue">TGEV</span> nsp1 protein was unable to bind 40S ribosomal subunits or promote host mRNA degradation. <span class="blue">TGEV</span> nsp1 also suppressed protein translation in cell-free HeLa cell extract; however, it did not affect translation in <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> reticulocyte lysate (RRL). Our data suggested that HeLa cell extracts and cultured host cells, but not RRL, contain a host factor(s) that is essential for <span class="blue">TGEV</span> nsp1-induced translational suppression.
