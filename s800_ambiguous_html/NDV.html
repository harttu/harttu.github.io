<h2>NDV</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20951166</h3>Rapid detection of <span class="yellow">Newcastle disease virus</span> replication in embryonated <span class="yellow">chicken</span> eggs using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. <br><br><span class="yellow">Newcastle disease virus</span> (<span class="blue">NDV</span>), an avian paramyxovirus, is an economically important disease of <span class="yellow">poultry</span> globally. Rapid methods to detect and differentiate the <span class="yellow">virus</span> are important to curtail the spread of this <span class="yellow">virus</span>. Nucleic acid based detection methods are routinely employed for diagnosis that suffer from the disadvantage of failure to discriminate viable <span class="yellow">virus</span> and non-infectious genome. However, <span class="yellow">virus</span> isolation remains the gold standard for diagnosis of field outbreaks. The sensitivity of <span class="yellow">virus</span> isolation was combined with nucleic acid based detection methods so that the time taken for confirmatory diagnosis could be considerably reduced while increasing sensitivity. Quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and conventional RT-PCR techniques were compared for the detection of <span class="blue">NDV</span> genome replication in 9-11-day-old embryonated <span class="yellow">chicken</span> eggs (ECE) using the nucleoprotein (NP) gene of the <span class="yellow">virus</span> as a target. The results suggest that at least two to fourfold increase in cycle threshold (C(t)) values over the baseline C(t) value of samples lacking infectious <span class="yellow">virus</span>, would indicate live <span class="blue">NDV</span> replication. The limit of detection of <span class="blue">NDV</span> replication using qRT-PCR was 1x10(4.0) mean embryo infective doses (EID(50)). The earliest time point when live <span class="yellow">virus</span> replication was detectable by qRT-PCR or RT-PCR was 30h post-inoculation in ECE. 
<h3>20962092</h3>Induction of type I interferon secretion through recombinant <span class="yellow">Newcastle disease virus</span> expressing <span class="yellow">measles virus</span> hemagglutinin stimulates antibody secretion in the presence of maternal antibodies. <br><br><span class="yellow">Measles virus</span> (<span class="yellow">MV</span>) vaccine effectively protects seronegative individuals against infection. However, inhibition of vaccine-induced seroconversion by maternal antibodies after vaccination remains a problem, as it leaves infants susceptible to <span class="yellow">MV</span> infection. In <span class="yellow">cotton</span> rats, passive transfer of <span class="yellow">MV</span>-specific IgG mimics maternal antibodies and inhibits vaccine-induced seroconversion. Here, we report that immunization in the presence of passively transferred IgG inhibits the secretion of neutralizing antibodies but not the generation of <span class="yellow">MV</span>-specific B cells. This finding suggested that <span class="yellow">MV</span>-specific B cells require an additional stimulus to mature into antibody-secreting plasma cells. In order to provide such a stimulus, we generated a recombinant <span class="yellow">Newcastle disease virus</span> (<span class="blue">NDV</span>) expressing the <span class="yellow">MV</span> hemagglutinin (<span class="yellow">NDV-H</span>). In contrast to <span class="yellow">MV</span>, <span class="yellow">NDV-H</span> induced high levels of type I interferon in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and in lung tissue. In <span class="yellow">cotton</span> rats immunized with <span class="yellow">NDV-H</span>, neutralizing antibodies were also generated in the presence of passively transferred antibodies. In the latter case, however, the level and kinetics of antibody generation were reduced. In vitro, alpha interferon stimulated the activation of <span class="yellow">MV</span>-specific B cells from <span class="yellow">MV</span>-immune spleen cells. <span class="blue">NDV</span> infection (which induces alpha interferon) had the same effect, and stimulation could be abrogated by antibodies neutralizing alpha interferon, but not interleukin 6 (IL-6). In vivo, coapplication of UV-inactivated <span class="yellow">MV</span> with <span class="blue">NDV</span> led to increased <span class="yellow">MV</span>-specific antibody production in the presence and absence of passively transferred antibodies. These data indicate that <span class="yellow">MV</span>-specific B cells are being generated after immunization in the presence of maternal antibodies and that the provision of alpha interferon as an additional signal leads to antibody secretion. 
<h3>20980510</h3>Assembly and immunological properties of <span class="yellow">Newcastle disease virus</span>-like particles containing the <span class="yellow">respiratory syncytial virus</span> F and G proteins. <br><br><span class="yellow">Human respiratory syncytial virus</span> (<span class="yellow">RSV</span>) is a serious respiratory pathogen in infants and young children as well as elderly and immunocompromised populations. However, no <span class="yellow">RSV</span> vaccines are available. We have explored the potential of virus-like particles (VLPs) as an <span class="yellow">RSV</span> vaccine candidate. VLPs composed entirely of <span class="yellow">RSV</span> proteins were produced at levels inadequate for their preparation as immunogens. However, VLPs composed of the <span class="yellow">Newcastle disease virus</span> (<span class="blue">NDV</span>) nucleocapsid and membrane proteins and chimera proteins containing the ectodomains of <span class="yellow">RSV</span> F and G proteins fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of <span class="blue">NDV</span> F and HN proteins, respectively, were quantitatively prepared from avian cells. Immunization of <span class="yellow">mice</span> with these VLPs, without adjuvant, stimulated robust, anti-<span class="yellow">RSV</span> F and G protein antibody responses. IgG2a/IgG1 ratios were very high, suggesting predominantly T(H)1 responses. In contrast to infectious <span class="yellow">RSV</span> immunization, neutralization antibody titers were robust and stable for 4 months. Immunization with a single dose of VLPs resulted in the complete protection of <span class="yellow">mice</span> from <span class="yellow">RSV</span> replication in lungs. Upon <span class="yellow">RSV</span> intranasal challenge of VLP-immunized <span class="yellow">mice</span>, no enhanced lung pathology was observed, in contrast to the pathology observed in <span class="yellow">mice</span> immunized with formalin-inactivated <span class="yellow">RSV</span>. These results suggest that these VLPs are effective <span class="yellow">RSV</span> vaccines in <span class="yellow">mice</span>, in contrast to other nonreplicating <span class="yellow">RSV</span> vaccine candidates. 
<h3>21034772</h3>Multiplex RT-PCR for rapid detection and differentiation of <span class="yellow">class I</span> and <span class="yellow">class II Newcastle disease viruses</span>. <br><br>A multiplex RT-PCR was developed for detection and differentiation of <span class="yellow">class I</span> and <span class="yellow">class II strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV)</span>. The method was shown to have high specificity and sensitivity. The results obtained from the multiplex RT-PCR for a total of 67 <span class="blue">NDV</span> field isolates obtained in 2009 were consistent with those obtained by nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. <span class="yellow">A</span> phylogenetic tree based on the partial sequences of the F gene revealed that the 67 field isolates of <span class="blue">NDV</span> could be divided into two classes. Twenty-seven <span class="blue">NDV</span><span class="yellow">NDV isolates</span> were grouped into <span class="yellow">class I</span>, and two genotypes were identified. Most of the <span class="yellow">class I</span> isolates were determined to be of genotype 3, with the exception of isolate <span class="yellow">NDV09-034</span>, which belonged to genotype 2. Forty <span class="yellow">class II NDV isolates</span> were divided into three genotypes, namely genotype VII (27 isolates), genotype I (2 isolates) and genotype II (11 isolates). Isolates of genotypes I and II in class II were shown to be related to commercial vaccine strains used commonly in China. All isolates of genotype VII were predicted to be virulent, on the basis of the sequence motif at the cleavage site of the F gene. This genotype has become predominantly responsible for most outbreaks of ND in China in recent years. In conclusion, this multiplex RT-PCR provides a new assay for rapid detection and differentiation of both classes of <span class="yellow">NDV isolates</span>.
