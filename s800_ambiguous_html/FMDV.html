<h2>FMDV</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20951743</h3>Development and validation of a lateral flow immunoassay using colloidal gold for the identification of serotype-specific <span class="annotated ">foot-and-mouth disease virus O</span>, <span class="annotated ">A</span> and <span class="annotated ">Asia 1</span>. <br><br>A lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) was developed to identify and diagnose <span class="annotated ">foot-and-mouth disease virus</span> (<span class="match annotated ">FMDV</span>) serotypes <span class="annotated ">O</span>, <span class="annotated ">A</span> and <span class="annotated ">Asia 1</span>. Antibodies obtained from <span class="annotated ">rabbits</span> and guinea <span class="unannotated ">pigs</span> immunized with cell-culture-adapted <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> strains (<span class="annotated ">O/CHA/99</span>, <span class="annotated ">A/GS/LX/66</span>, <span class="annotated ">Asia 1/CHN/05</span>) and suckling-<span class="annotated ">mouse</span> adapted <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> strains (<span class="annotated ">O/AV99(L)</span>, <span class="annotated ">A/AV88(L)</span>, <span class="annotated ">Asia 1/YNBS/58</span>) were used as capture antibodies. The diagnostic kit included three immunochromatographic strips of types <span class="annotated ">O</span>, <span class="annotated ">A</span> and <span class="annotated ">Asia 1</span>, and the type-specific results were confirmed by color on the test lines of the three strips. The LFI was evaluated using epithelial and vesicular samples (n=396) prepared from current and historical field samples (provide by the National Foot-and-Mouth Disease Reference Laboratory of China at Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute). Negative samples (n=95) were collected from healthy animals. The diagnostic sensitivity of the LFI for <span class="match annotated ">FMDV</span> serotypes <span class="annotated ">O</span>, <span class="annotated ">A</span> and <span class="annotated ">Asia 1</span> was 88.3% compared to 89.7% obtained by the reference method of indirect-sandwich ELISA. The sensitivity of the LFI for <span class="annotated ">FMDV type Asia 1</span> was higher at 92.1% compared to 90.5% for the ELISA. The specificity of the LFI was 97.1% compared with 97.4%.
