<h2>D. hansenii</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20601040</h3>Monovalent cations regulate expression and activity of the Hak1 potassium transporter in <span class="yellow">Debaryomyces hansenii</span>. <br><br><span class="yellow">Debaryomyces hansenii</span> was able to grow in a medium containing residual amounts of K(+), indicating the activity of high affinity K(+) transporters. Transcriptional regulation analysis of the genes encoding the two potassium uptake systems in <span class="blue">D. hansenii</span> revealed that while DhTRK1 is not regulated at transcriptional level, expression of DhHAK1 required starvation in the absence of K(+) and Na(+) and was not affected by changes in membrane potential. Rb(+) transport in cells expressing DhHAK1 was activated by external Na(+) or acidic pH and inhibited by high pH. We propose a K(+)-H(+) symporter that, under certain conditions may work as a K(+)-Na(+) transporter, as the mechanism driving K(+) influx mediated by DhHak1p.
