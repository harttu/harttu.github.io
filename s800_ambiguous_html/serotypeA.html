<h2>serotype A</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20719250</h3>Regulation of virulence factors, carbon utilization and virulence by SNF1 in <span class="annotated ">Cryptococcus neoformans JEC21</span> and divergent actions of SNF1 between cryptococcal strains. <br><br>We describe here the functions of a Snf1/AMPK homolog in the <span class="unannotated ">human</span> pathogenic <span class="unannotated ">yeast</span> <span class="unannotated ">Cryptococcus neoformans</span>, strain <span class="annotated ">JEC21</span>. We found that <span class="annotated ">JEC21</span> SNF1 is a key regulator for the biosynthesis of the major virulence factors, stress resistance and alternative carbon source utilization. Disruption of <span class="annotated ">JEC21</span> SNF1 results in defects of laccase activity and capsule production, sensitivity to cation stress. Especially, we found that <span class="annotated ">JEC21</span> SNF1 is essential for growth at elevated temperature and for thermotolerance. To our knowledge, a role for Snf1 proteins in thermotolerance has not been reported. Furthermore, we observed a functional divergence between <span class="unannotated ">JEC21</span> SNF1 and its equivalent from <span class="match unannotated ">serotype A</span><span class="unannotated ">A</span> strain <span class="annotated ">H99</span>. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> high temperature is needed for <span class="annotated ">H99</span> SNF1 to function in stress response and carbon source preference, but not for the <span class="annotated ">JEC21</span> SNF1. Our results confirmed a critical role of <span class="annotated ">JEC21</span> SNF1 in regulation of stress response and virulence. Revelation of divergent actions of SNF1 may help to understand the evolution of cryptococcal pathogenesis and provides insights into the strain-associated biosynthesis of virulence factors. 
<h3>20971202</h3>Ste50 adaptor protein governs sexual differentiation of <span class="annotated ">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> via the pheromone-response MAPK signaling pathway. <br><br>The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways control diverse cellular functions in pathogenic fungi, including sexual differentiation, stress response, and maintenance of cell wall integrity. Here we characterized a <span class="annotated ">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> gene, which is homologous to the <span class="unannotated ">yeast</span> Ste50 that is known to play an important role in mating pheromone response and stress response as an adaptor protein to the Ste11 MAPK kinase kinase in <span class="annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>. The <span class="annotated ">C. neoformans</span> Ste50 was not involved in any of the stress responses or virulence factor production (capsule and melanin) that are controlled by the HOG and Ras/cAMP signaling pathways. However, Ste50 was required for mating in both <span class="match annotated ">serotype A</span> and <span class="annotated ">serotype D C. neoformans</span> strains. The ste50Delta mutant was completely defective in cell-cell fusion and mating pheromone production. Double mutation of the STE50 gene blocked increased production of pheromone and the hyper-filamentation phenotype of cells deleted of the CRG1 gene, which encodes the RGS protein that negatively regulates pheromone responsive G-protein signaling via the MAPK pathway. Regardless of the presence of the basidiomycota-specific SH3 domains of Ste50 that are known to be required for full virulence of <span class="annotated ">Ustilago maydis</span>, Ste50 was dispensable for virulence of <span class="annotated ">C. neoformans</span> in a <span class="linneaus_only ">murine</span> model of cryptococcosis. In conclusion, the Ste50 adaptor protein controls sexual differentiation of <span class="annotated ">C. neoformans</span> via the pheromone-responsive MAPK pathway but is not required for virulence. 
<h3>21029752</h3>Multiplex PCR for rapid detection of <span class="annotated ">serotype A foot-and-mouth disease virus</span> variants with amino acid deletion at position 59 of the capsid protein VP3. <br><br>In India, there has been co-circulation, extinction and emergence of genotypes/lineages within <span class="match unannotated ">serotype A</span><span class="unannotated ">A</span> foot-and-mouth disease (<span class="annotated ">FMD</span>) <span class="unannotated ">virus</span>. At present an antigenically heterogeneous, unique lineage within genotype VII dominates the field outbreaks. This genetic cluster has amino acid deletion at position 59 of VP3 (VP3(59)-deletion group), considered to be critical antigenically. The emergence of this group warrants rapid and accurate detection to facilitate early planning and implementation of an effective control policy. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> rapid multiplex PCR assay was developed for detection of the dominating VP3(59)-deletion group with 100% sensitivity and specificity, even before generating sequence data and confirmatory phylogenetic analysis. This development is important for surveillance of <span class="annotated ">FMD</span> in India. 
<h3>21067947</h3>Characterizing the role of RNA silencing components in <span class="annotated ">Cryptococcus neoformans</span>. <br><br>The RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by homology-dependent degradation of the target mRNA with small RNA molecules plays a key role in controlling transcription and translation processes in a number of eukaryotic organisms. The RNAi machinery is also evolutionarily conserved in a wide variety of <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> species, including pathogenic fungi. To elucidate the physiological functions of the RNAi pathway in <span class="annotated ">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> that causes <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> meningitis, here we performed genetic analyses for genes encoding Argonaute (AGO1 and AGO2), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDP1), and Dicers (DCR1 and DCR2) in both <span class="match unannotated ">serotype A</span><span class="unannotated ">A</span> and D <span class="annotated ">C. neoformans</span>. The present study shows that Ago1, Rdp1, and Dcr2 are the major components of the RNAi process occurring in <span class="annotated ">C. neoformans</span>. However, the RNAi machinery is not involved in regulation of production of two virulence factors (capsule and melanin), sexual differentiation, and diverse stress response. Comparative transcriptome analysis of the <span class="match unannotated ">serotype A</span><span class="unannotated ">A</span> and D RNAi mutants revealed that only modest changes occur in the genome-wide transcriptome profiles when the RNAi process was perturbed. Notably, the serotype D rdp1Delta mutants showed an increase in transcript abundance of active retrotransposons and transposons, such as T2 and T3, the latter of which is a novel serotype D-specific transposon of <span class="annotated ">C. neoformans</span>. In a wild type background both T2 and T3 were found to be weakly active mobile elements, although we found no evidence of Cnl1 retrotransposon mobility. In contrast, all three transposable elements exhibited enhanced mobility in the rdp1Delta mutant strain. In conclusion, the RNAi pathway plays an important role in controlling transposon activity and genome integrity of <span class="annotated ">C. neoformans</span>.
