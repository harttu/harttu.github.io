<h2>F. graminearum</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20887797</h3>The FvMK1 mitogen-activated protein kinase gene regulates conidiation, pathogenesis, and fumonisin production in <span class="annotated ">Fusarium verticillioides</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Fusarium verticillioides</span> is one of the most important <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> pathogens to cause destructive diseases of <span class="annotated ">maize</span> worldwide. Fumonisins produced by the fungus are harmful to <span class="annotated ">human</span> and animal health. To date, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with pathogenicity and fumonisin biosynthesis in <span class="annotated ">F. verticillioides</span> is limited. Because MAP kinase pathways have been implicated in regulating diverse processes important for plant infection in phytopathogenic fungi, in this study we identified and functionally characterized the FvMK1 gene in <span class="annotated ">F. verticillioides</span>. FvMK1 is orthologous to FMK1 in <span class="annotated ">F. oxysporum</span> and GPMK1 in <span class="match annotated ">F. graminearum</span>. The Fvmk1 deletion mutant was reduced in vegetative growth and production of microconidia. However, it was normal in sexual reproduction and increased in the production of macroconidia. In infection assays with developing <span class="annotated ">corn</span> kernels, the Fvmk1 mutant was non-pathogenic and failed to colonize through wounding sites. It also failed to cause stalk rot symptoms beyond the inoculation sites on <span class="annotated ">corn</span> stalks, indicating that FvMK1 is essential for plant infection. Furthermore, the Fvmk1 mutant was significantly reduced in fumonisin production and expression levels of FUM1 and FUM8, two genes involved in fumonisin biosynthesis. The defects of the Fvmk1 mutant were fully complemented by re-introducing the wild type FvMK1 allele. These results demonstrate that FvMK1 plays critical roles in the regulation of vegetative growth, asexual reproduction, fumonisin biosynthesis, and pathogenicity. 
<h3>20955812</h3>Paralogous cyp51 genes in <span class="annotated ">Fusarium graminearum</span> mediate differential sensitivity to sterol demethylation inhibitors. <br><br>Analysis of the genome sequence of <span class="annotated ">Fusarium graminearum</span> revealed three paralogous cyp51 genes (designated cyp51A, -B, and -C) encoding 14-alpha demethylases in this fungus. Targeted gene disruption showed that the cyp51A, -B or -C disruption mutants were morphologically indistinguishable from the parent isolate on <span class="annotated ">potato</span> dextrose agar medium, which indicates that none of these genes is essential for mycelial growth. The sensitivity of cyp51A deletion mutants to seven sterol demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicides increased significantly compared to the parent strain, while sensitivity of cyp51C deletion mutants increased to some but not all DMIs. No change in DMI sensitivity was observed for cyp51B deletion mutants. The parental phenotypes of cyp51A and cyp51C deletion mutants were completely restored by genetic complementation with the wild-type cyp51A and cyp51C genes, respectively. The sensitivity of <span class="match annotated ">F. graminearum</span> isolates increased significantly when subjected in vitro to a mixture of DMI fungicides triadimefon and tebuconazole as compared to the individual components. These results indicate that different DMI fungicides target different CYP51 proteins in <span class="match annotated ">F. graminearum</span> and that a mixture of DMI fungicides can result in synergistic effects. Our findings have directly implications on chemical management strategies of plant diseases caused by Fusarium species. 
<h3>21216300</h3>The genetic basis for 3-ADON and 15-ADON trichothecene chemotypes in Fusarium.<br><br>Certain Fusarium species cause head blight of <span class="annotated ">wheat</span> and other small grains worldwide and produce trichothecene mycotoxins. These mycotoxins can induce toxicoses in animals and <span class="annotated ">humans</span> and can contribute to the ability of some fusaria to cause plant disease. Production of the trichothecene 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-ADON) versus 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-ADON) is an important phenotypic difference within and among some Fusarium species. However, until now, the genetic basis for this difference in chemotype has not been identified. Here, we identified consistent DNA sequence differences in the coding region of the trichothecene biosynthetic gene TRI8 in 3-ADON and 15-ADON strains. Functional analyses of the TRI8 enzyme (Tri8) in <span class="match annotated ">F. graminearum</span>, the predominant cause of <span class="unannotated ">wheat</span> head blight in North America and Europe, revealed that Tri8 from 3-ADON strains catalyzes deacetylation of the trichothecene biosynthetic intermediate 3,15-diacetyldeoxynivalenol at carbon 15 to yield 3-ADON, whereas Tri8 from 15-ADON strains catalyzes deacetylation of 3,15-diacetyldeoxynivalenol at carbon 3 to yield 15-ADON. Fusarium strains that produce the trichothecene nivalenol have a Tri8 that functions like that in 15-ADON strains. TRI3, which encodes a trichothecene carbon 15 acetyltransferase, was found to be functional in all three chemotypes. Together, our data indicate that differential activity of Tri8 determines the 3-ADON and 15-ADON chemotypes in Fusarium. 
<h3>21126599</h3>The pH regulatory factor Pac1 regulates Tri gene expression and trichothecene production in <span class="annotated ">Fusarium graminearum</span>. <br><br>Fungi manage the adaptation to extra-cellular pH through the PacC transcription factor, a key component of the pH regulatory system. PacC regulates the production of various secondary metabolites in filamentous fungi. In the important cereal pathogen <span class="annotated ">Fusarium graminearum</span>, the production of trichothecene is induced only under acidic pH conditions. Here, we examined the role of the PacC homologue from <span class="match annotated ">F. graminearum</span>, FgPac1, on the regulation of trichothecene production. An FgDeltaPac1 deletion mutant was constructed in <span class="match annotated ">F. graminearum</span> which showed a reduced development under neutral and alkaline pH, increased sensitivity to H(2)O(2) and an earlier Tri gene induction and toxin accumulation at acidic pH. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> strain expressing the FgPac1(c) constitutively active form of Pac1 exhibited a strongly repressed Tri gene expression and reduced toxin accumulation at acidic pH. These results demonstrate that Pac1 negatively regulates Tri gene expression and toxin production in <span class="match annotated ">F. graminearum</span>. 
<h3>21601644</h3>Analysis of the <span class="annotated ">Fusarium graminearum species complex</span> from <span class="annotated ">wheat</span>, <span class="annotated ">barley</span> and <span class="annotated ">maize</span> in South Africa provides evidence of species-specific differences in host preference. <br><br>Species identity and trichothecene toxin potential of 560 members of the <span class="annotated ">Fusarium graminearum species complex</span> (<span class="annotated ">FGSC</span>) collected from diseased <span class="annotated ">wheat</span>, <span class="annotated ">barley</span> and <span class="annotated ">maize</span> in South Africa was determined using a microsphere-based multilocus genotyping assay. Although three trichothecene types (3-ADON, 15-ADON and NIV) were represented among these isolates, strains with the 15-ADON type predominated on all three hosts. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> significant difference, however, was identified in the composition of <span class="annotated ">FGSC</span> pathogens associated with Gibberella ear rot (GER) of <span class="annotated ">maize</span> as compared to Fusarium head blight (FHB) of <span class="annotated ">wheat</span> or <span class="annotated ">barley</span> (P&lt;0.001). <span class="match annotated ">F. graminearum</span> accounted for more than 85% of the <span class="annotated ">FGSC</span> isolates associated with FHB of <span class="annotated ">wheat</span> and <span class="annotated ">barley</span> (N=425), and was also the dominant species among isolates from <span class="annotated ">maize</span> roots (N=35). However, with the exception of a single isolate identified as an interspecific hybrid between <span class="annotated ">Fusariumboothii</span> and <span class="match annotated ">F. graminearum</span>, GER of <span class="annotated ">maize</span> (N=100) was exclusively associated with <span class="annotated ">F. boothii</span>. The predominance of <span class="match annotated ">F. graminearum</span> among FHB isolates, and the near exclusivity of <span class="annotated ">F. boothii</span> among GER isolates, was observed across all cultivars, collection dates, and provinces sampled. Because these results suggest a difference in host preference among species of the <span class="annotated ">FGSC</span>, we hypothesize that <span class="match annotated ">F. graminearum</span> may be less well adapted to infect <span class="annotated ">maize</span> ears than other members of the <span class="annotated ">FGSC</span>. 
<h3>22004876</h3>Novel Fusarium head blight pathogens from Nepal and Louisiana revealed by multilocus genealogical concordance. <br><br>This study was conducted to assess evolutionary relationships, species diversity and trichothecene toxin potential of five <span class="annotated ">Fusarium graminearum complex</span> (<span class="annotated ">FGSC</span>) isolates identified as genetically novel during prior Fusarium head blight (FHB) surveys in Nepal and Louisiana. Results of a multilocus genotyping (MLGT) assay for B-trichothecene species determination indicated these isolates might represent novel species within the <span class="annotated ">FGSC</span>. GCPSR-based phylogenetic analyses of a 12-gene dataset, comprising portions of seven loci totaling 13.1kb of aligned DNA sequence data, provided strong support for the genealogical exclusivity of the Nepalese and Louisianan isolates. Accordingly, both species are formally recognized herein as novel <span class="annotated ">FGSC species</span>. <span class="annotated ">Fusarium nepalense</span> was resolved as the sister lineage of <span class="annotated ">Fusarium ussurianum+Fusarium asiaticum</span> within an Asian subclade of the <span class="annotated ">FGSC</span>. <span class="annotated ">Fusarium louisianense</span> was strongly supported as a reciprocally monophyletic sister of <span class="annotated ">Fusarium gerlachii+F. graminearum</span>, suggesting that this subclade might be endemic to North America. Multilocus Bayesian species tree analyses augment these results and provide evidence for a distinct lineage within <span class="match annotated ">F. graminearum</span> predominately from the Gulf Coast of Louisiana. As predicted by the MLGT assay, mycotoxin analyses demonstrated that <span class="annotated ">F. nepalense</span> and <span class="annotated ">F. louisianense</span> could produce 15ADON and nivalenol, respectively, in planta. In addition, both species were only able to induce mild FHB symptoms on <span class="unannotated ">wheat</span> in pathogenicity experiments.
