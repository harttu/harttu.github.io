<h2>Paramecium caudatum</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21277756</h3>Thermal performance curves of <span class="match annotated ">Paramecium caudatum</span>: a model selection approach.<br><br>The ongoing climate change has motivated numerous studies investigating the temperature response of various organisms, especially that of ectotherms. To correctly describe the thermal performance of these organisms, functions are needed which sufficiently fit to the complete optimum curve. Surprisingly, model-comparisons for the temperature-dependence of population growth rates of an important ectothermic group, the protozoa, are still missing. In this study, temperature reaction norms of natural isolates of the freshwater protist <span class="match annotated ">Paramecium caudatum</span> were investigated, considering nearly the entire temperature range. These reaction norms were used to estimate thermal performance curves by applying a set of commonly used model functions. An information theory approach was used to compare models and to identify the best ones for describing these data. Our results indicate that the models which can describe negative growth at the high- and low-temperature branch of an optimum curve are preferable. This is a prerequisite for accurately calculating the critical upper and lower thermal limits. While we detected a temperature optimum of around 29 ^0C for all investigated clonal strains, the critical thermal limits were considerably different between individual clones. Here, the tropical clone showed the narrowest thermal tolerance, with a shift of its critical thermal limits to higher temperatures. 
<h3>21497073</h3>Dynamic behaviour of stationary pronuclei during their positioning in <span class="match annotated ">Paramecium caudatum</span>. <br><br>During conjugation of <span class="match annotated ">Paramecium caudatum</span>, there are two well-known stages when nuclear migration occurs. What happens to the nuclei is closely related to their localisations in cells. The first of these stages is the entrance of one meiotic product into the paroral region. This nucleus survives, while the remaining three outside this area degenerate. The second stage is the antero-posterior localisation of eight synkaryon division products. Four posterior nuclei are differentiated into macronuclear anlagen, whereas four anterior nuclei remain as the presumptive micronuclei. In this experiment, the process of the third prezygotic division of <span class="annotated ">P. caudatum</span> was studied with the help of protargol staining. Here, a third nuclear migration was discovered. By two spindle turnings and two spindle elongations, stationary pronuclei were positioned near migratory pronuclei. This positioning of stationary pronuclei could shorten the distance for transferred migratory pronuclei to recognise and reach the stationary pronuclei. This fosters the synkaryon formation of <span class="annotated ">P. caudatum</span>.
