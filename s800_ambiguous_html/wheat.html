</br>
Improved nitrogen nutrition enhances root uptake , root - to - shoot translocation and remobilization of zinc ( ( 65 ) Zn ) in <b>wheat</b> . 
</br>
The results demonstrate that the N - nutritional status of <b>wheat</b> affects major steps in the route of Zn from the growth medium to the grain , including its uptake , xylem transport and remobilization via phloem . 
</br>
Functional analyses of the TRI8 enzyme ( Tri8 ) in SB__F SI__. SI__graminearum , the predominant cause of <b>wheat</b> head blight in North America and Europe , revealed that Tri8 from 3 - ADON strains catalyzes deacetylation of the trichothecene biosynthetic intermediate 3 , 15 - diacetyldeoxynivalenol at carbon 15 to yield 3 - ADON , whereas Tri8 from 15 - ADON strains catalyzes deacetylation of 3 , 15 - diacetyldeoxynivalenol at carbon 3 to yield 15 - ADON . 
</br>
We investigated the response of g ( m ) to changes in CO2 in two Arabidopsis genotypes ( including a mutant with open stomata , ost1 ) , tobacco and <b>wheat</b> . 
</br>
In addition , both species were only able to induce mild FHB symptoms on <b>wheat</b> in pathogenicity experiments .

The results may explain the male sterility caused by low temperature in <b>wheat</b> TGMS lines .
