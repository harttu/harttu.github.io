</br>
SGT1 contributes to coronatine signaling and SB__Pseudomonas SI__syringae SI__pv SI__. SI__tomato disease symptom development in SB__tomato and <b>Arabidopsis</b> . 
</br>
In <b>Arabidopsis</b> , AtSGT1b but not AtSGT1a was required for COR responses , including root growth inhibition and SB__Pst SI__DC3000 symptom ( water soaked lesion ) development . 
</br>
* Taken together , our results demonstrate that SGT1 / SGT1b is required for COR - induced chlorosis and subsequent necrotic disease development in SB__tomato and <b>Arabidopsis</b> . 
</br>
A seed high - lysine trait is negatively associated with the TCA cycle and slows down <b>Arabidopsis</b> seed germination . 
</br>
* Lysine is a nutritionally important essential amino acid , but significant elevation of its levels in <b>Arabidopsis</b> seeds , by enhancing its synthesis and blocking its catabolism , causes a retardation of germination . 
</br>
We recently demonstrated that HT represses the expression of YUCCA auxin biosynthesis genes and reduces endogenous auxin in the developing anthers of SB__barley and <b>Arabidopsis</b> . 
</br>
Moreover , NO accumulation was not observed in H7 plants overexpressing the SB__A SI__. SI__thaliana nonsymbiotic hemoglobin <b>Arabidopsis</b> haemoglobin 1 ( AHb1 ) . 
</br>
The <b>Arabidopsis</b> tt19 - 4 mutant differentially accumulates proanthocyanidin and anthocyanin through a 3 ' amino acid substitution in glutathione S - transferase . 
</br>
The <b>Arabidopsis</b> transparent testa ( tt ) mutant tt19 - 4 shows reduced seed coat colour , but stains darkly with DMACA and accumulates anthocyanins in aerial tissues . 
</br>
We suggest that the dark seed coat of <b>Arabidopsis</b> is related to soluble proanthocyanidin content and that quercetin holds the key to the function of TT19 . 
</br>
A bicistronic , Ubiquitin - 10 promoter - based vector cassette for transient transformation and functional analysis of membrane transport demonstrates the utility of quantitative voltage clamp studies on intact <b>Arabidopsis</b> root epidermis . 
</br>
Here we describe a Gateway - compatible , bicistronic vector , incorporating the constitutive Ubiqutin - 10 gene promoter of <b>Arabidopsis</b> that gives prolonged expression after transient transformation and enables fluorescence marking of cells without a fusion construct . 
</br>
We show that <b>Arabidopsis</b> root epidermal cells are readily transformed by co - cultivation with Agrobacterium and are tractable for quantitative electrophysiological analysis . 
</br>
As a proof of principle , we transiently transformed <b>Arabidopsis</b> with the bicistronic vector carrying GFP as the fluorescent marker and , separately , the integral plasma membrane protein SYP121 essential for the inward K + channel current . 
</br>
SB__Rice OsEDR1 is a sequence ortholog of <b>Arabidopsis</b> EDR1 . 
</br>
Separating parental environment from seed size effects on next generation growth and development in <b>Arabidopsis</b> . 
</br>
We investigated the response of g ( m ) to changes in CO2 in two <b>Arabidopsis</b> genotypes ( including a mutant with open stomata , ost1 ) , tobacco and wheat .

</br>
* We analysed the expression of over 1900 transcription factors ( TFs ) and 180 microRNA primary transcripts ( pri - miRNAs ) in <b>Arabidopsis</b> roots exposed to different hypoxic conditions by means of quantitative PCR .
