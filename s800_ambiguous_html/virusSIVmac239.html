<h2>virus SIVmac239</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20962091</h3>Macaque long-term nonprogressors resist superinfection with multiple CD8+ T cell escape variants of <span class="annotated ">simian immunodeficiency virus</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Human immunodeficiency virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">HIV</span>)-positive individuals can be superinfected with different <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> strains. Individuals who control an initial <span class="annotated ">HIV</span> infection are therefore still at risk for subsequent infection with divergent viruses, but the barriers to such superinfection remain unclear. Here we tested long-term nonprogressors' (LTNPs') susceptibility to superinfection using <span class="annotated ">Indian rhesus macaques</span> that express the major histocompatibility complex <span class="unannotated ">class I</span> (MHC-I) allele Mamu-B 17, which is associated with control of the pathogenic AIDS <span class="match annotated ">virus SIVmac239</span>. The Mamu-B 17-restricted CD8(+) T cell repertoire is focused almost entirely on 5 epitopes. We engineered a series of <span class="unannotated ">SIVmac239</span> variants bearing mutations in 3, 4, or all 5 of these epitopes and used them to serially challenge 2 Mamu-B 17-positive LTNPs. None of the escape variants caused breakthrough replication in LTNPs, although they readily infected Mamu-B 17-negative naive macaques. In vitro competing coculture assays and examination of <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> evolution in hosts lacking Mamu-B 17 suggested that the mutant viruses had negligible defects in replicative fitness. Both LTNPs maintained robust immune responses, including <span class="annotated ">simian immunodeficiency virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">SIV</span>)-specific CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells and neutralizing antibodies. Our results suggest that escape mutations in epitopes bound by &quot;protective&quot; MHC-I molecules may not be sufficient to establish superinfection in LTNPs. 
<h3>20962096</h3>Identification and structural characterization of the ALIX-binding late domains of <span class="annotated ">simian immunodeficiency virus</span><span class="match unannotated ">virus SIVmac239</span> and <span class="annotated ">SIVagmTan-1</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Retroviral</span> Gag proteins contain short late-domain motifs that recruit cellular ESCRT pathway proteins to facilitate <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> budding. ALIX-binding late domains often contain the core consensus sequence YPX(n)L (where X(n) can vary in sequence and length). However, some <span class="annotated ">simian immunodeficiency virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">SIV</span>) Gag proteins lack this consensus sequence, yet still bind ALIX. We mapped divergent, ALIX-binding late domains within the p6(Gag) proteins of SIV(mac239) ((40)SREKPYKEVTEDLLHLNSLF(59)) and <span class="annotated ">SIV(agmTan-1)</span> ((24)AAGAYDPARKLLEQYAKK(41)). Crystal structures revealed that anchoring tyrosines (in lightface) and nearby hydrophobic residues (underlined) contact the ALIX V domain, revealing how lentiviruses employ a diverse family of late-domain sequences to bind ALIX and promote <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> budding.
