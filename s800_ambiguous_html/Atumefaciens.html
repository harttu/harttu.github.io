<h2>A. tumefaciens</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21075924</h3>argC Orthologs from Rhizobiales show diverse profiles of transcriptional efficiency and functionality in <span class="annotated ">Sinorhizobium meliloti</span>. <br><br>Several factors can influence ortholog replacement between closely related species. We evaluated the transcriptional expression and metabolic performance of ortholog substitution complementing a <span class="annotated ">Sinorhizobium meliloti</span> argC mutant with argC from Rhizobiales (<span class="annotated ">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span>, <span class="annotated ">Rhizobium etli</span>, and <span class="annotated ">Mesorhizobium loti</span>). The argC gene is necessary for the synthesis of arginine, an amino acid that is central to protein and cellular metabolism. Strains were obtained carrying plasmids with argC orthologs expressed under the speB and argC (<span class="annotated ">S. meliloti</span>) and lac (<span class="annotated ">Escherichia coli</span>) promoters. Complementation analysis was assessed by growth, transcriptional activity, enzymatic activity, mRNA levels, specific detection of ArgC proteomic protein, and translational efficiency. The argC orthologs performed differently in each complementation, reflecting the diverse factors influencing gene expression and the ability of the ortholog product to function in a foreign metabolic background. Optimal complementation was directly related to sequence similarity with <span class="annotated ">S. meliloti</span>, and was inversely related to species signature, with <span class="annotated ">M. loti</span> argC showing the poorest performance, followed by <span class="annotated ">R. etli</span> and <span class="match annotated ">A. tumefaciens</span>. Different copy numbers of genes and amounts of mRNA and protein were produced, even with genes transcribed from the same promoter, indicating that coding sequences play a role in the transcription and translation processes. These results provide relevant information for further genomic analyses and suggest that orthologous gene substitutions between closely related species are not completely functionally equivalent.
