<h2>TBSV</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20962095</h3>Role of RNase MRP in <span class="yellow">viral</span> RNA degradation and RNA recombination.<br><br>RNA degradation, together with RNA synthesis, controls the steady-state level of <span class="yellow">viral</span> RNAs in infected cells. The endoribonucleolytic cleavage of <span class="yellow">viral</span> RNA is important not only for <span class="yellow">viral</span> RNA degradation but for RNA recombination as well, due to the participation of some RNA degradation products in the RNA recombination process. To identify host endoribonucleases involved in degradation of <span class="yellow">Tomato bushy stunt virus</span> (<span class="blue">TBSV</span>) in a <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> model host, we tested eight known endoribonucleases. Here we report that downregulation of SNM1, encoding a component of the RNase MRP, and a temperature-sensitive mutation in the NME1 gene, coding for the RNA component of RNase MRP, lead to reduced production of the endoribonucleolytically cleaved <span class="blue">TBSV</span> RNA in <span class="yellow">yeast</span>. We also show that the highly purified <span class="yellow">yeast</span> RNase MRP cleaves the <span class="blue">TBSV</span> RNA in vitro, resulting in <span class="blue">TBSV</span> RNA degradation products similar in size to those observed in <span class="yellow">yeast</span> cells. Knocking down the NME1 homolog in <span class="yellow">Nicotiana benthamiana</span> also led to decreased production of the cleaved <span class="blue">TBSV</span> RNA, suggesting that in plants, RNase MRP is involved in <span class="blue">TBSV</span> RNA degradation. Altogether, this work suggests a role for the host endoribonuclease RNase MRP in <span class="yellow">viral</span> RNA degradation and recombination.
