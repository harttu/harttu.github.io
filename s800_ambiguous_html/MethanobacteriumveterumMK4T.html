<h2>Methanobacterium veterum MK4(T)</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20173003</h3>Methanobacterium arcticum sp. nov., a methanogenic archaeon from Holocene Arctic permafrost. 

A mesophilic, non-motile, hydrogenotrophic, rod-shaped methanogen, designated <span class="yellow">M2(T)</span>, was isolated from Holocene permafrost sediments of the Kolyma lowland in the Russian Arctic. Cells were 3-6 mum long and 0.45-0.5 mum wide. Strain <span class="yellow">M2(T)</span> grew on H(2)/CO(2) and formate. Optimum conditions for growth were 37^0C, pH 6.8-7.2 and 0.1 M NaCl. The DNA G+C content was 38.1 mol%. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison with known methanogens, strain <span class="yellow">M2(T)</span> was affiliated with the genus Methanobacterium and was most closely related to <span class="blue">Methanobacterium veterum MK4(T)</span> and <span class="yellow">Methanobacterium bryantii</span> <span class="yellow">DSM 863(T)</span> (both 99 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). However, no significant DNA-DNA relatedness was observed between strain <span class="yellow">M2(T)</span> and these type strains. We propose that strain <span class="yellow">M2(T)</span> represents a novel species, with the name Methanobacterium arcticum sp. nov., with type strain <span class="yellow">M2(T)</span> (=DSM 19844(T) =VKM B-2371(T)).
