<h2>jackfruit</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20962077</h3><span class="annotated ">Simian immunodeficiency virus</span> from the <span class="annotated ">sooty mangabey</span> and <span class="annotated ">rhesus macaque</span> is modified with O-linked carbohydrate. <br><br>Although stretches of serine and threonine are sometimes sites for O-linked carbohydrate attachment, specific sequence and structural determinants for O-linked attachment remain ill defined. The gp120 envelope protein of <span class="annotated ">SIVmac239</span> contains a serine-threonine-rich stretch of amino acids at positions 128 to 139. Here we show that lectin protein from <span class="match annotated ">jackfruit</span> seed (jacalin), which binds to non- and monosialylated core 1 O-linked carbohydrate, potently inhibited the replication of <span class="annotated ">SIVmac239</span>. Selection of a jacalin-resistant <span class="annotated ">SIVmac239</span> variant population resulted in <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> with specific substitutions within amino acids 128 to 139. Cloned <span class="annotated ">simian immunodeficiency virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">SIV</span>) variants with substitutions in the 128-to-139 region had infectivities equivalent to, or within 1 log unit of, that of <span class="annotated ">SIVmac239</span> and were resistant to the inhibitory effects of jacalin. Characterization of the <span class="annotated ">SIVmac239</span> gp120 O-linked glycome showed the presence of core 1 and core 2 O-linked carbohydrate; a 128-to-139-substituted variant gp120 from jacalin-resistant <span class="annotated ">SIV</span> lacked O-linked carbohydrate. Unlike that of <span class="annotated ">SIVmac239</span>, the replication of <span class="annotated ">HIV-1 strain NL4-3</span> was resistant to inhibition by jacalin. Purified gp120s from four <span class="annotated ">SIVmac</span> and <span class="annotated ">SIVsm</span> strains bound jacalin strongly in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while nine different <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> gp120s, two <span class="annotated ">SIVcpz</span> gp120s, and 128-to-139-substituted <span class="annotated ">SIVmac239</span> gp120 did not bind jacalin. The ability or inability to bind jacalin thus correlated with the presence of the serine-threonine-rich stretch in the <span class="annotated ">SIVmac</span> and <span class="annotated ">SIVsm</span> gp120s and the absence of such stretches in the <span class="annotated ">SIVcpz</span> and <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> gp120s. Consistent with sequence predictions, two <span class="annotated ">HIV-2</span> gp120s bound jacalin, while one did not. These data demonstrate the presence of non- and monosialylated core 1 O-linked carbohydrate on the gp120s of <span class="annotated ">SIVmac</span> and <span class="annotated ">SIVsm</span> and the lack of these modifications on <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> and <span class="annotated ">SIVcpz</span> gp120s.
