<h2>F. boothii</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21601644</h3>Analysis of the <span class="annotated ">Fusarium graminearum species complex</span> from <span class="annotated ">wheat</span>, <span class="annotated ">barley</span> and <span class="annotated ">maize</span> in South Africa provides evidence of species-specific differences in host preference. <br><br>Species identity and trichothecene toxin potential of 560 members of the <span class="annotated ">Fusarium graminearum species complex</span> (<span class="annotated ">FGSC</span>) collected from diseased <span class="annotated ">wheat</span>, <span class="annotated ">barley</span> and <span class="annotated ">maize</span> in South Africa was determined using a microsphere-based multilocus genotyping assay. Although three trichothecene types (3-ADON, 15-ADON and NIV) were represented among these isolates, strains with the 15-ADON type predominated on all three hosts. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> significant difference, however, was identified in the composition of <span class="annotated ">FGSC</span> pathogens associated with Gibberella ear rot (GER) of <span class="annotated ">maize</span> as compared to Fusarium head blight (FHB) of <span class="annotated ">wheat</span> or <span class="annotated ">barley</span> (P&lt;0.001). <span class="annotated ">F. graminearum</span> accounted for more than 85% of the <span class="annotated ">FGSC</span> isolates associated with FHB of <span class="annotated ">wheat</span> and <span class="annotated ">barley</span> (N=425), and was also the dominant species among isolates from <span class="annotated ">maize</span> roots (N=35). However, with the exception of a single isolate identified as an interspecific hybrid between <span class="annotated ">Fusariumboothii</span> and <span class="annotated ">F. graminearum</span>, GER of <span class="annotated ">maize</span> (N=100) was exclusively associated with <span class="match annotated ">F. boothii</span>. The predominance of <span class="annotated ">F. graminearum</span> among FHB isolates, and the near exclusivity of <span class="match annotated ">F. boothii</span> among GER isolates, was observed across all cultivars, collection dates, and provinces sampled. Because these results suggest a difference in host preference among species of the <span class="annotated ">FGSC</span>, we hypothesize that <span class="annotated ">F. graminearum</span> may be less well adapted to infect <span class="annotated ">maize</span> ears than other members of the <span class="annotated ">FGSC</span>.
