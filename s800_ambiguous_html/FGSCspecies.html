<h2>FGSC species</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>22004876</h3>Novel Fusarium head blight pathogens from Nepal and Louisiana revealed by multilocus genealogical concordance. <br><br>This study was conducted to assess evolutionary relationships, species diversity and trichothecene toxin potential of five <span class="yellow">Fusarium graminearum complex</span> (<span class="yellow">FGSC</span>) isolates identified as genetically novel during prior Fusarium head blight (FHB) surveys in Nepal and Louisiana. Results of a multilocus genotyping (MLGT) assay for B-trichothecene species determination indicated these isolates might represent novel species within the <span class="yellow">FGSC</span>. GCPSR-based phylogenetic analyses of a 12-gene dataset, comprising portions of seven loci totaling 13.1kb of aligned DNA sequence data, provided strong support for the genealogical exclusivity of the Nepalese and Louisianan isolates. Accordingly, both species are formally recognized herein as novel <span class="blue">FGSC species</span>. <span class="yellow">Fusarium nepalense</span> was resolved as the sister lineage of <span class="yellow">Fusarium ussurianum+Fusarium asiaticum</span> within an Asian subclade of the <span class="yellow">FGSC</span>. <span class="yellow">Fusarium louisianense</span> was strongly supported as a reciprocally monophyletic sister of <span class="yellow">Fusarium gerlachii+F. graminearum</span>, suggesting that this subclade might be endemic to North America. Multilocus Bayesian species tree analyses augment these results and provide evidence for a distinct lineage within <span class="yellow">F. graminearum</span> predominately from the Gulf Coast of Louisiana. As predicted by the MLGT assay, mycotoxin analyses demonstrated that <span class="yellow">F. nepalense</span> and <span class="yellow">F. louisianense</span> could produce 15ADON and nivalenol, respectively, in planta. In addition, both species were only able to induce mild FHB symptoms on <span class="yellow">wheat</span> in pathogenicity experiments.
