<h2>S. pneumoniae</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21097633</h3>Genome annotation and intraviral interactome for the <span class="yellow">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> virulent phage Dp-1. <br><br><span class="yellow">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> causes several diseases, including pneumonia, septicemia, and meningitis. Phage Dp-1 is one of the very few isolated virulent <span class="blue">S. pneumoniae</span> bacteriophages, but only a partial characterization is currently available. Here, we confirmed that Dp-1 belongs to the family Siphoviridae. Then, we determined its complete genomic sequence of 56,506 bp. It encodes 72 open reading frames, of which 44 have been assigned a function. We have identified putative promoters, Rho-independent terminators, and several genomic clusters. We provide evidence that Dp-1 may be using a novel DNA replication system as well as redirecting host protein synthesis through queuosine-containing tRNAs. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of purified phage Dp-1 particles identified at least eight structural proteins. Finally, using comprehensive <span class="yellow">yeast</span> two-hybrid screens, we identified 156 phage protein interactions, and this intraviral interactome was used to propose a structural model of Dp-1.
