<h2>IMNV</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21029750</h3>Detection of <span class="yellow">infectious myonecrosis virus</span> using monoclonal antibody specific to N and C fragments of the capsid protein expressed heterologously. <br><br>The gene encoding the capsid protein in ORF1 of the genome of <span class="yellow">infectious myonecrosis virus</span> (<span class="blue">IMNV</span>) (GenBank AY570982) was amplified into three parts named CP-N (nucleotides 2248-3045), CP-I (nucleotides 3046-3954) and CP-C (nucleotides 3955-4953). The CP-N fragment was inserted into expression vector pTYB1 while CP-I and CP-C were each inserted into expression vector pGEX-6P-1 for transformation of <span class="yellow">BL21 E. coli</span> strain. After induction, intein-CP-N (84 kDa), glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-CP-I (60 kDa) and GST-CP-C (62 kDa) fusion proteins were produced. They were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroeluted before immunization of Swiss <span class="yellow">mice</span> for monoclonal antibody (MAb) production. Two MAbs specific to CP-N and one MAb specific to CP-C were selected for use for detection of natural <span class="blue">IMNV</span> infections in <span class="yellow">Penaeus vannamei</span> by dot blotting, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. There was no cross-reaction with shrimp tissues or common shrimp viruses including <span class="yellow">white spot syndrome virus</span> (<span class="yellow">WSSV</span>), <span class="yellow">yellow head virus</span> (<span class="yellow">YHV</span>), <span class="yellow">Taura syndrome virus</span> (<span class="yellow">TSV</span>), <span class="yellow">Penaeus monodon nucleopolyhedrovirus</span> (<span class="yellow">PemoNPV</span>), <span class="yellow">Penaeus stylirostris</span> densovirus (PstDNV) and Penaeus monodon densovirus (PmDNV). The detection sensitivities of the MAbs were approximately 6 fmol/spot of purified recombinant intein-CP-N protein and 8 fmol/spot of GST-CP-C as determined by dot blotting. <span class="yellow">A</span> combination of all three MAbs resulted in a twofold increase in sensitivity over use of any single MAb. However, this sensitivity was approximately 10 times lower than that of one-step RT-PCR using the same sample. Immunohistochemical analysis using MAbs specific to CP-N and CP-C in <span class="blue">IMNV</span>-infected shrimp revealed intense staining patterns in muscles, the lymphoid organ, gills, the heart, hemocytes and connective tissue.
