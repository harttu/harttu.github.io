<h2>Helicoverpa assulta</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21166910</h3>Natural history and intragenomic dynamics of the Transib transposon Hztransib in the <span class="yellow">cotton bollworm</span> <span class="yellow">Helicoverpa zea</span>. 

Hztransib, recently identified from <span class="yellow">Helicoverpa zea</span>, represents the first intact and transcriptionally active Transib element. Its open reading frame was detected in <span class="yellow">Helicoverpa armigera</span>, from which <span class="yellow">H. zea</span> evolved, and in <span class="blue">Helicoverpa assulta</span>, the common ancestor of <span class="yellow">H. zea</span> and <span class="yellow">H. armigera</span>, but its remaining parts were found only in <span class="yellow">H. armigera</span>. Thirty-nine Hztransib insertion sites, all of which are polymorphic, were detected from eight populations of <span class="yellow">H. zea</span>. Out of the 39 insertion sites, 35 were not frequently occupied, with 1-33 occurrences in a total of 128 individuals from the eight populations (16 larvae per population). Its copy number ranged from 5.8 to 14.2 per individual, with putative intact copies always more abundant than internally deleted ones. Taking this evidence together, Hztransib probably transferred to <span class="yellow">H. zea</span> from <span class="yellow">H. armigera</span> and most likely still retains its capacity to maintain structural integrity, increase copy number and remobilize in <span class="yellow">H. zea</span>.
