<h2>serotype A foot-and-mouth disease virus</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21029752</h3>Multiplex PCR for rapid detection of <span class="blue">serotype A foot-and-mouth disease virus</span> variants with amino acid deletion at position 59 of the capsid protein VP3. <br><br>In India, there has been co-circulation, extinction and emergence of genotypes/lineages within <span class="yellow">serotype A</span><span class="yellow">A</span> foot-and-mouth disease (<span class="yellow">FMD</span>) <span class="yellow">virus</span>. At present an antigenically heterogeneous, unique lineage within genotype VII dominates the field outbreaks. This genetic cluster has amino acid deletion at position 59 of VP3 (VP3(59)-deletion group), considered to be critical antigenically. The emergence of this group warrants rapid and accurate detection to facilitate early planning and implementation of an effective control policy. <span class="yellow">A</span> rapid multiplex PCR assay was developed for detection of the dominating VP3(59)-deletion group with 100% sensitivity and specificity, even before generating sequence data and confirmatory phylogenetic analysis. This development is important for surveillance of <span class="yellow">FMD</span> in India.
