<h2>wSinvictaA</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21526927</h3>Wolbachia <span class="match annotated ">wSinvictaA</span> infections in natural populations of the <span class="annotated ">fire ant</span> <span class="annotated ">Solenopsis invicta</span>: testing for phenotypic effects. <br><br>Wolbachia are intracellular bacteria that commonly infect many arthropods and some nematodes. In arthropods, these maternally transmitted bacteria often induce a variety of phenotypic effects to enhance their own spread within host populations. Wolbachia phenotypic effects generally either provide benefits to infected host females (cytoplasmic incompatibility, positive fitness effects) or bias host sex ratio in favor of females (male-killing, parthenogenesis, feminization), all of which increase the relative production of infected females in host populations. Wolbachia surveys have found infections to be exceedingly common in ants, but little is known at this juncture as to what phenotypic effects, if any, they induce in this group. Previous studies have demonstrated that individuals from native populations of the invasive <span class="annotated ">fire ant</span> <span class="annotated ">Solenopsis invicta</span> commonly harbor one or more of three Wolbachia variants. One of the variants, <span class="match unannotated ">wSinvictaA</span>, typically occurs at low prevalence in <span class="annotated ">S. invicta</span> populations, appears to have been transmitted horizontally into <span class="annotated ">S. invicta</span> three or more times, and has been lost repeatedly from host lineages over time. In order to determine the phenotypic effects and likely population dynamics of <span class="match annotated ">wSinvictaA</span> infections in these ants, brood production patterns of newly mated <span class="annotated ">fire ant</span> queens were studied during simulated claustral founding and measured <span class="match annotated ">wSinvictaA</span> transmission fidelity within mature single-queen families. No clear evidence was found for Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility, significant fitness effects, or male-killing. Maternal transmission was perfect to both virgin queens and males. Possible mechanisms for how this variant could be maintained in host populations are discussed.
