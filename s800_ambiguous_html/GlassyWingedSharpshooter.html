<h2>Glassy-Winged Sharpshooter</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>22182607</h3>Culture Independent Survey of the Microbiota of the <span class="match annotated ">Glassy-Winged Sharpshooter</span> (<span class="annotated ">Homalodisca vitripennis</span>) Using 454 Pyrosequencing. <br><br>The <span class="annotated ">glassy-winged sharpshooter</span>, <span class="annotated ">Homalodisca vitripennis (Germar)</span>, is an invasive pest that has spread across the southern and western United States. <span class="annotated ">H. vitripennis</span> is highly polyphagous and voracious, feeding on at least 100 plant species and consuming up to 100 times its weight in xylem fluid daily. The insect is a vector of the phytopathogen <span class="annotated ">Xylella fastidiosa (Wells)</span>, which is the causative agent of Pierce's disease in grapevines. To evaluate the microbial flora associated with <span class="annotated ">H. vitripennis</span>, total DNA extracts from hemolymph, alimentary canal excretions, and whole insect bodies were subjected to 16S rDNA pyrosequencing using the bTEFAP methodology and the resulting sequences (370-520 bp in length) were compared with a curated high quality 16S database derived from GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Species from the genera Wolbachia, Delftia (formerly Pseudomonas), Pectobacterium, Moraxella, Serratia, Bacillus, and many others were detected and a comprehensive picture of the microbiome associated with <span class="annotated ">H. vitripennis</span> was established. Some of the bacteria identified in this report are initial discoveries; providing a breadth of knowledge to the microbial flora of this insect pest can serve as a reservoir of information for developing biological control strategies.
