<h2>A</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20139282</h3>Proposal of Mingxiaea gen. nov. for the anamorphic basidiomycetous <span class="yellow">yeast</span> species in the Bulleribasidium clade (Tremellales) based on molecular phylogenetic analysis, with six new combinations and four novel species. <br><br>The distinction and monophyletic property of the basidiomycetous <span class="yellow">yeast</span> species in the Bulleribasidium clade of the order Tremellales was resolved by molecular phylogenetic analysis based on the combined sequences of the 18S rRNA gene, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region including 5.8S rRNA gene and 26S rRNA gene D1/D2 domain. The addition to the clade of new anamorphic species identified among ballistoconidium-forming <span class="yellow">yeasts</span> isolated from China confirmed and strengthened the separation of this clade from other clades or lineages in the order Tremellales. <span class="red">A</span> new anamorphic genus, Mingxiaea gen. nov. (type species Mingxiaea variabilis comb. nov.) is therefore proposed to accommodate the anamorphic species in the Bulleribasidium clade. Six new combinations are proposed for the described species of this clade which were formerly assigned to the genus Bullera. Four novel species in the new genus were identified among 16 ballistoconidium-forming <span class="yellow">yeast</span> strains isolated from plant leaves collected in Hainan province, southern China, by D1/D2 and ITS sequence analyses. The novel species are described as Mingxiaea sanyaensis sp. nov. (type strain SY-3.23(T) =AS 2. 3623(T) =CBS 11408(T)), Mingxiaea hainanensis (type strain WZS-8.13(T) =AS 2.4161(T) =CBS 11409(T)), Mingxiaea foliicola (type strain WZS-8.14(T) =AS 2.3518(T) =CBS 11407(T)) and Mingxiaea wuzhishanensis (type strain WZS-29.8(T) =AS 2.4163(T) =CBS 11411(T)). 
<h3>20139283</h3><span class="yellow">Scardovia wiggsiae</span> sp. nov., isolated from the <span class="yellow">human</span> oral cavity and clinical material, and emended descriptions of the genus Scardovia and <span class="yellow">Scardovia inopinata</span>. <br><br>Six strains of anaerobic, pleomorphic Gram-positive bacilli, isolated from the <span class="yellow">human</span> oral cavity and an infected arm wound, were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests and were found to comprise a homogeneous group. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the isolates were most closely related to <span class="yellow">Scardovia inopinata</span> CCUG 35729(T) (94.8-94.9 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). The isolates were saccharolytic and produced acetic and lactic acids as end products of fermentation. The major fatty acids were C(16 : 0) (49.8 %) and C(18 : 1)omega9c (35.8 %). Polar lipid analysis revealed a variety of glycolipids, diphosphatidylglycerol, an unidentified phospholipid and an unidentified phosphoglycolipid. No respiratory quinones were detected. The peptidoglycan was of the type A4alpha L-Lys-Thr-Glu, with L-lysine partially replaced by L-ornithine. The DNA G+C content of one of the strains, C1A_55(T)(,) was 55 mol%. <span class="red">A</span> novel species, <span class="yellow">Scardovia wiggsiae</span> sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate the six isolates, with the type strain C1A_55(T) (=DSM 22547(T)=CCUG 58090(T)). 
<h3>20633690</h3>UreA, the major urea/H+ symporter in <span class="yellow">Aspergillus nidulans</span>. <br><br>We report here the characterization of UreA, a high-affinity urea/H+ symporter of <span class="yellow">Aspergillus nidulans</span>. The deletion of the encoding gene abolishes urea transport at low substrate concentrations, suggesting that in these conditions UreA is the sole transport system specific for urea in <span class="yellow">A. nidulans</span>. The ureA gene is not inducible by urea or its precursors, but responds to nitrogen metabolite repression, necessitating for its expression the AreA GATA factor. In contrast to what was observed for other transporters in <span class="yellow">A. nidulans</span>, repression by ammonium is also operative during the isotropic growth phase. The activity of UreA is down-regulated post-translationally by ammonium-promoted endocytosis. <span class="red">A</span> number of homologues of UreA have been identified in <span class="yellow">A. nidulans</span> and other Aspergilli, which cluster in four groups, two of which contain the urea transporters characterized so far in fungi and plants. This phylogeny may have arisen by gene duplication events, giving place to putative transport proteins that could have acquired novel, still unidentified functions. 
<h3>20650684</h3>Possible roles of phospholipase A(2) in the biological activities of <span class="yellow">Acanthamoeba castellanii</span> (T4 Genotype). <br><br>Using phospholipases A(2)-specific spectrophotometric assays, it was shown that <span class="yellow">A. castellanii</span> lysates and their conditioned medium exhibit phospholipase activities. The extracellular levels of PLA(2)detected were significantly reduced compared with the cell-associated enzyme (P&lt;0.05). Sphinganine, a PLA(2)inhibitor showed robust amoebistatic properties but had no effect on the viability of <span class="yellow">A. castellanii</span>. The potency of sphinganine was demonstrated effectively towards purified PLA(2)derived from porcine pancreas. Using sphinganine, it was observed that PLA(2)is involved in neither binding nor cytotoxicity of the <span class="yellow">human</span> brain microvascular endothelial cells due to <span class="yellow">A. castellanii</span>. Unlike as was the case for Dictyostelium amoebae, PLA(2) appeared to be involved in <span class="yellow">A. castellanii</span> phagocytosis of the fluorescently-labelled polystyrene beads. <span class="yellow">Horseradish</span> peroxidase was used as a tracer molecule to develop assays to study pinocytosis in <span class="yellow">A. castellanii</span>. The findings revealed that sphinganine impedes phagocytosis but augments pinocytosis in <span class="yellow">A. castellanii</span> suggesting distinct nature of processes. <span class="red">A</span> complete understanding of the role of phospholipases in the biology and pathogenesis of <span class="yellow">A. castellanii</span> infections will determine their potential as therapeutic targets. 
<h3>20708962</h3>Does climate warming stimulate or inhibit soil protist communities? <span class="red">A</span> test on testate amoebae in high-arctic tundra with free-air temperature increase. <br><br>Soil testate amoebae assemblages in a grassland area at Zackenberg (Northeast Greenland) were subjected to simulated climate-warming during the growing season using the Free-Air Temperature Increase technique. Samples were collected in upper (0 - 3cm) and deeper (3 - 6cm) soil horizons. Mean temperature elevations at 2.5 and 7.5 cm depth were 2.58 +/- SD 1.11 and 2.13+/-SD 0.77^0C, respectively, and did not differ significantly. Soil moisture in the top 11cm was not affected by the warming. During the manipulation, the densities of living amoebae and empty shells were higher in the experimental plots but only in the upper layer. Possibly, testate amoebae in the deeper layer were limited by other factors, suggesting that warming enhances the carrying capacity only in favourable conditions. Species richness, on the other hand, was only increased in the deeper horizon. Warming did not change the percentage of individuals belonging to small-sized species in any of the living assemblages, contrary to our expectation that those species would quickly increase their density. However, in the empty shell assemblages, the proportion of small-sized individuals in the experimental plots was higher in both layers, indicating a rapid, transient increase in small amoebae before the first sampling date. Changes in successional state of testate amoebae assemblages in response to future climate change might thus be ephemeral, whereas alterations in density and species richness might be more sustained. 
<h3>20719250</h3>Regulation of virulence factors, carbon utilization and virulence by SNF1 in <span class="yellow">Cryptococcus neoformans JEC21</span> and divergent actions of SNF1 between cryptococcal strains. <br><br>We describe here the functions of a Snf1/AMPK homolog in the <span class="yellow">human</span> pathogenic <span class="yellow">yeast</span> <span class="yellow">Cryptococcus neoformans</span>, strain <span class="yellow">JEC21</span>. We found that <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1 is a key regulator for the biosynthesis of the major virulence factors, stress resistance and alternative carbon source utilization. Disruption of <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1 results in defects of laccase activity and capsule production, sensitivity to cation stress. Especially, we found that <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1 is essential for growth at elevated temperature and for thermotolerance. To our knowledge, a role for Snf1 proteins in thermotolerance has not been reported. Furthermore, we observed a functional divergence between <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1 and its equivalent from <span class="yellow">serotype A</span><span class="red">A</span> strain <span class="yellow">H99</span>. <span class="red">A</span> high temperature is needed for <span class="yellow">H99</span> SNF1 to function in stress response and carbon source preference, but not for the <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1. Our results confirmed a critical role of <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1 in regulation of stress response and virulence. Revelation of divergent actions of SNF1 may help to understand the evolution of cryptococcal pathogenesis and provides insights into the strain-associated biosynthesis of virulence factors. 
<h3>20735792</h3>Wildlife diseases: from individuals to ecosystems.<br><br>1. We review our ecological understanding of wildlife infectious diseases from the individual host to the ecosystem scale, highlighting where conceptual thinking lacks verification, discussing difficulties and challenges, and offering potential future research directions. 2. New molecular approaches hold potential to increase our understanding of parasite interactions within hosts. Also, advances in our knowledge of immune systems makes immunological parameters viable measures of parasite exposure, and useful tools for improving our understanding of causal mechanisms. 3. Studies of transmission dynamics have revealed the importance of heterogeneity in host behaviour and physiology, and of contact processes operating at different spatial and temporal scales. An important future challenge is to determine the key transmission mechanisms maintaining the persistence of different types of diseases in the wild. 4. Regulation of host populations is too complex to consider parasite effects in isolation from other factors. One solution is to seek a unified understanding of the conditions under which (and the ecological rules determining when) population scale impacts of parasites can occur. 5. Good evidence now shows that both direct effects of parasites, and trait mediated indirect effects, frequently mediate the success of invasive species and their impacts on recipient communities. <span class="red">A</span> wider exploration of these effects is now needed. 6. At the ecosystem scale, research is needed to characterize the circumstances and conditions under which both fluxes in parasite biomass, and trait mediated effects, are significant in ecosystem processes, and to demonstrate that parasites do indeed increase 'ecosystem health'. 7. There is a general need for more empirical testing of predictions and subsequent development of theory in the classic research cycle. Experimental field studies, meta-analyses, the collection and analysis of long-term data sets, and data constrained modelling, will all be key to advancing our understanding. 8. Finally, we are only now beginning to understand the importance of cross-scale interactions associated with parasitism. Such interactions may offer key insights into bigger picture questions such as when and how different regulatory factors are important, when disease can cause species extinctions, and what characteristics are indicative of functionally resilient ecosystems. 
<h3>20807372</h3>Increased intracellular H2O2 availability preferentially drives glutathione accumulation in vacuoles and chloroplasts. <br><br>One biochemical response to increased H2O2 availability is the accumulation of glutathione disulphide (GSSG), the disulphide form of the key redox buffer glutathione. It remains unclear how this potentially important oxidative stress response impacts on the different sub-cellular glutathione pools. We addressed this question by using two independent in situ glutathione labelling techniques in <span class="yellow">Arabidopsis</span> wild type (Col-0) and the GSSG-accumulating cat2 mutant. <span class="red">A</span> comparison of in situ labelling with monochlorobimane (MCB) and in vitro labelling with monobromobimane (MBB) revealed that, whereas in situ labelling of Col-0 leaf glutathione was complete within 2 h incubation, about 50% of leaf glutathione remained inaccessible to MCB in cat2. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and enzymatic assays showed that this correlated tightly with the glutathione redox state, pointing to significant in vivo pools of GSSG in cat2 that were unavailable for MCB labelling. Immunogold labelling of leaf sections to estimate sub-cellular glutathione distribution showed that the accumulated GSSG in cat2 was associated with only a minor increase in cytosolic glutathione but with a 3- and 10-fold increase in plastid and vacuolar pools, respectively. The data are used to estimate compartment-specific glutathione concentrations under optimal and oxidative stress conditions, and the implications for redox homeostasis and signalling are discussed. 
<h3>20837155</h3>Genetic mapping of 14 avirulence genes in an EU-B04 x 1639 progeny of <span class="yellow">Venturia inaequalis</span>. <br><br>Durable resistance to <span class="yellow">apple</span> scab (<span class="yellow">Venturia inaequalis</span> (Cke) Wint; anamorph <span class="yellow">Spilocaea pomi</span> Fries) is one of the major goals of <span class="yellow">apple</span> (Malus) breeding programs. Since current scab resistance breeding is heavily reliant on genes with gene-for-gene relationships, a good understanding of the genetic basis of host-pathogen interactions needs to be developed for this strategy to be successful. While the genomic organization of <span class="yellow">apple</span> scab resistance genes has been studied extensively, little is known about the avirulence genes in the pathogen. The progeny of a cross of European <span class="yellow">V. inaequalis</span> race (1) isolate EU-B04 and race (1,2,8,9) isolate 1639 was used to generate a genetic map based on microsatellite and AFLP markers, and investigated for inheritance of avirulence traits on 20 Malus accessions representing 17 scab resistance genes. The accessions comprised scab differential hosts (0), (1), (2), (8), and (9), and hosts carrying known as well as not previously reported secondary resistance genes, including some identified in crosses that have resistant accessions 'Geneva', 'Dolgo', <span class="yellow">Malus baccata jackii</span>, <span class="yellow">M. micromalus</span>, or 'Antonovka' in their pedigree. The latter genes appear to be narrow spectrum genes that showed gene-for-gene relationships as a segregation ratio of Avr:avr=1:1 was observed on 12 accessions, while a ratio of 3:1 was observed on five accessions and a ratio of 7:1 on one host. All progenies were shown to be pathogenic, as all of them were able to infect hosts (0) and (1). <span class="red">A</span> genetic map consisting of 15 major linkage groups (LGs) and spanning 972cM was generated with the aid of 156 markers. The map position of 12 avirulence traits was determined: eight avirulence genes mapped into two separate clusters (1: AvrVdg2, AvrVv1, AvrVu1, AvrVrjrd; and 2: AvrVu2, AvrVh3.2, AvrVs1, AvrVu4), while four avirulence genes (AvrRvi8, AvrVv2, AvrVt57 and AvrVsv) mapped to different LGs. AvrRvi2 and AvrRvi9 also are genetically linked, but showed an interaction with AvrRvi8, the nature of which is unclear. While AvrRvi8 segregated at 1:1 ratio, the other two Avrs segregated at 3:1 ratios. However, all progeny avirulent on hosts (2) and (9) were also avirulent on host (8) and further research is required to determine the avirulence gene relationships. <span class="red">A</span> further two independently segregating loci, AvrRvi1 and AvrRvi6, identified in previous studies, were mapped by inference based on their known linkage to SSR markers. The clustering of avirulence genes in <span class="yellow">V. inaequalis</span> reflecting the clustering of resistance genes in Malus suggests this pathosystem is a classical example of an &quot;arms race&quot; between host and pathogen. This also seems to apply to the narrow spectrum scab resistance genes, which may imply a larger role in plant defense for these genes than has been assumed to date. 
<h3>20840611</h3>Do quantitative vessel and pit characters account for ion-mediated changes in the hydraulic conductance of angiosperm xylem? <br><br>* The hydraulic conductance of angiosperm xylem has been suggested to vary with changes in sap solute concentrations because of intervessel pit properties. * The magnitude of the 'ionic effect' was linked with vessel and pit dimensions in 20 angiosperm species covering 13 families including six Lauraceae species. * <span class="red">A</span> positive correlation was found between ionic effect and vessel grouping parameters, especially the portion of vessel walls in contact with neighbouring vessels. Species with intervessel contact fraction (F(C)) values &lt; 0.1 showed an ionic effect between 2% and 17%, while species with F(C) values > 0.1 exhibited a response between 10% and 32%. The ionic effect increased linearly with the mean fraction of the total vessel wall area occupied by intervessel pits as well as with the intervessel contact length. However, no significant correlation occurred between the ionic effect and total intervessel pit membrane area per vessel, vessel diameter, vessel length, vessel wall area, and intervessel pit membrane thickness. * Quantitative vessel and pit characters are suggested to contribute to interspecific variation of the ionic effect, whereas chemical properties of intervessel pit membranes are likely to play an additional role. 
<h3>20854397</h3>Growth-mediated stress escape: convergence of signal transduction pathways activated upon exposure to two different environmental stresses. <br><br>* Plants can escape from specific environmental stresses through active growth strategies. Here, we compared two such stress-escape syndromes to investigate whether plants use conserved signal transduction pathways to escape from different stresses. * Full submergence is a threat to terrestrial plants as it cuts off their access to oxygen and CO(2). Proximate neighbors, in contrast, take away resources such as light. Both submergence and shade can be escaped through rapid shoot elongation. We analysed the precise kinetics and physiological control of petiole elongation responses to shade and submergence in the flood-tolerant species <span class="yellow">Rumex palustris</span>. * We found that petiole elongation induced by submergence and that induced by shade occurred with similar kinetics, both involving cell expansion. These responses were induced by two different signals, elevated ethylene and a reduced red : far-red light ratio (R : FR), respectively. <span class="red">A</span> downstream target for ethylene was abscisic acid, but low R : FR appeared to act independently of this hormone. Gibberellin, however, appeared to be essential to both ethylene- and low R : FR-induced petiole elongation. * We propose that gibberellin and expansins, a family of cell wall-loosening proteins, represent elements of a conserved growth machinery that is activated by stress-specific signaling events to regulate escape from stress. 
<h3>20870768</h3>Mutational analysis of the transmembrane helix 2-HAMP domain connection in the <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span> aspartate chemoreceptor tar. <br><br>Transmembrane helix 2 (TM2) of the Tar chemoreceptor undergoes an inward piston-like displacement of 1 to 3 <span class="red">A</span> upon binding aspartate. This signal is transmitted to the kinase-control module via the HAMP domain. Within Tar, the HAMP domain forms a parallel four-helix bundle consisting of a dimer of two amphipathic helices connected by a flexible linker. In the nuclear magnetic resonance structure of an archaeal HAMP domain, residues corresponding to the MLLT sequence between Arg-214 at the end of TM2 and Pro-219 of Tar are an N-terminal helical extension of AS1. We modified this region to test whether it behaves as a continuous helical connection between TM2 and HAMP. First, one to four Gly residues were inserted between Thr-218 and Pro-219. Second, the MLLT sequence was replaced with one to nine Gly residues. Third, the sequence was shortened or extended with residues compatible with helix formation. Cells expressing receptors in which the MLLT sequence was shortened to MLL or in which the MLLT sequence was replaced by four Gly residues performed good aspartate chemotaxis. Other mutant receptors supported diminished aspartate taxis. Most mutant receptors had biased signal outputs and/or abnormal patterns of adaptive methylation. We interpret these results to indicate that a strong, permanent helical connection between TM2 and the HAMP domain is not necessary for normal transmembrane signaling. 
<h3>20874804</h3>Dissection of the phytohormonal regulation of trichome formation and biosynthesis of the antimalarial compound artemisinin in <span class="yellow">Artemisia annua plants</span>. <br><br>* Biosynthesis of the sesquiterpene lactone and potent antimalarial drug artemisinin occurs in glandular trichomes of <span class="yellow">Artemisia annua plants</span> and is subjected to a strict network of developmental and other regulatory cues. * The effects of three hormones, jasmonate, gibberellin and cytokinin, were studied at the structural and molecular levels in two different <span class="yellow">A. annua</span> chemotypes by microscopic analysis of gland development, and by targeted metabolite and transcript profiling. Furthermore, a genome-wide cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)-based transcriptome profiling was carried out of jasmonate-elicited leaves at different developmental stages. * Although cytokinin and gibberellin positively affected at least one aspect of gland formation, these two hormones did not stimulate artemisinin biosynthesis. Only jasmonate simultaneously promoted gland formation and coordinated transcriptional activation of biosynthetic gene expression, which ultimately led to increased sesquiterpenoid accumulation with chemotype-dependent effects on the distinct pathway branches. Transcriptome profiling revealed a trichome-specific fatty acyl- coenzyme <span class="red">A</span> reductase, trichome-specific fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1 (TFAR1), the expression of which correlates with trichome development and sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis. * TFAR1 is potentially involved in cuticular wax formation during glandular trichome expansion in leaves and flowers of <span class="yellow">A. annua plants</span>. Analysis of phytohormone-modulated transcriptional regulons provides clues to dissect the concerted regulation of metabolism and development of plant trichomes. 
<h3>20880202</h3>A new, vapour-phase mechanism for stomatal responses to humidity and temperature. <br><br>A new mechanism for stomatal responses to humidity and temperature is proposed. Unlike previously-proposed mechanisms, which rely on liquid water transport to create water potential gradients within the leaf, the new mechanism assumes that water transport to the guard cells is primarily through the vapour phase. Under steady-state conditions, guard cells are assumed to be in near-equilibrium with the water vapour in the air near the bottom of the stomatal pore. As the water potential of this air varies with changing air humidity and leaf temperature, the resultant changes in guard cell water potential produce stomatal movements. <span class="red">A</span> simple, closed-form, mathematical model based on this idea is derived. The new model is parameterized for a previously published set of data and is shown to fit the data as well as or better than existing models. The model contains mathematical elements that are consistent with previously-proposed mechanistic models based on liquid flow as well as empirical models based on relative humidity. As such, it provides a mechanistic explanation for the realm of validity for each of these approaches. 
<h3>20880204</h3>Cadmium uptake and sequestration kinetics in individual leaf cell protoplasts of the Cd/Zn hyperaccumulator <span class="yellow">Thlaspi caerulescens</span>. <br><br>Hyperaccumulators store accumulated metals in the vacuoles of large leaf epidermal cells (storage cells). For investigating cadmium uptake, we incubated protoplasts obtained from leaves of <span class="yellow">Thlaspi caerulescens (Ganges ecotype)</span> with a Cd-specific fluorescent dye. <span class="red">A</span> fluorescence kinetic microscope was used for selectively measuring Cd-uptake and photosynthesis in different cell types, so that physical separation of cell types was not necessary. Few minutes after its addition, cadmium accumulated in the cytoplasm before its transport into the vacuole. This demonstrated that vacuolar sequestration is the rate-limiting step in cadmium uptake into protoplasts of all leaf cell types. During accumulation in the cytoplasm, Cd-rich vesicle-like structures were observed. Cd uptake rates into epidermal storage cells were higher than into standard-sized epidermal cells and mesophyll cells. This shows that the preferential heavy metal accumulation in epidermal storage cells, previously observed for several metals in intact leaves of various hyperaccumulator species, is due to differences in active metal transport and not differences in passive mechanisms like transpiration stream transport or cell wall adhesion. Combining this with previous studies, it seems likely that the transport steps over the plasma and tonoplast membranes of leaf epidermal storage cells are driving forces behind the hyperaccumulation phenotype. 
<h3>20880205</h3>Factors required for the high CO2 specificity of the anaerobically induced <span class="yellow">maize</span> GapC4 promoter in transgenic <span class="yellow">tobacco</span>. <br><br>Flooding, a natural cause of anaerobiosis, is often accompanied by high CO(2) concentrations in the flood water. Plants need to respond to these environmental conditions. Strong anaerobic reporter gene activity in <span class="yellow">tobacco</span> (<span class="yellow">Nicotiana tabacum</span>) controlled by the glycolytic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GapC4) promoter from <span class="yellow">maize</span> (<span class="yellow">Zea mays</span>) depends on the presence of CO(2) and light. To identify factors required for CO(2) regulated gene expression, promoter deletions fused to the Beta-glucuronidase reporter gene were studied in transgenic <span class="yellow">tobacco</span>. Deletion of a 40 bp fragment directly upstream of the TATA box leads to increased anaerobic reporter gene activity both, in the presence and absence of CO(2). This deletion does not affect light specific anaerobic expression. <span class="red">A</span> positive correlation between increasing CO(2) concentrations and gene activity is observed. Electrophoretic mobility shift experiments indicate that <span class="yellow">tobacco</span> nuclear extracts harbour proteins that bind to part of the 40 bp fragment. Database assisted as well as experimental analysis reveal a role for AP2/EREBP transcription factors for conferring the high CO(2) specificity to the GapC4 promoter in <span class="yellow">tobacco</span> leaves. This work highlights the importance for plants to respond to high environmental CO(2) concentrations under anaerobic conditions. 
<h3>20888926</h3>A genomic map enriched for markers linked to Avr1 in <span class="yellow">Cronartium quercuum f.sp. fusiforme</span>. <br><br>A novel approach is presented to map avirulence gene Avr1 in the basidiomycete <span class="yellow">Cronartium quercuum f.sp. fusiforme</span>, the causal agent of fusiform rust disease in pines. DNA markers tightly linked to resistance gene Fr1 in <span class="yellow">loblolly pine</span> tree 10-5 were used to classify 10-5 seedling progeny as either resistant or susceptible. <span class="red">A</span> single dikaryotic isolate (P2) heterozygous at the corresponding Avr1 gene was developed by crossing Fr1 avirulent isolate SC20-21 with Fr1 virulent isolate NC2-40. Bulk basidiospore inoculum derived from isolate P2 was used to challenge the pine progeny. The ability to unambiguously marker classify 10-5 progeny as resistant (selecting for virulence) or susceptible (non-selecting) permitted the genetic mapping of the corresponding Avr1 gene by bulked segregant analysis. Using this approach, 14 genetic markers significantly linked to Avr1 were identified and placed within the context of a genome-wide linkage map produced for isolate P2 using samples from susceptible seedlings. 
<h3>20923689</h3>Simultaneous virus-specific detection of the two <span class="yellow">cassava</span> brown streak-associated viruses by RT-PCR reveals wide distribution in East Africa, mixed infections, and infections in <span class="yellow">Manihot glaziovii</span>. <br><br>The expanding <span class="yellow">cassava</span> brown streak disease (CBSD) epidemic in East Africa is caused by two ipomoviruses (genus Ipomovirus; Potyviridae), namely, <span class="yellow">Cassava brown streak virus</span> (<span class="yellow">CBSV</span>), and <span class="yellow">Ugandan cassava brown streak virus</span> (<span class="yellow">UCBSV</span>) that was described recently. <span class="red">A</span> reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based diagnostic method was developed in this study for simultaneous virus-specific detection of the two viruses. Results showed that <span class="yellow">CBSV</span> and <span class="yellow">UCBSV</span> are distributed widely in the highlands (> 1000 m above the sea level) of the Lake Victoria zone in Uganda and Tanzania and also in the Indian Ocean costal lowlands of Tanzania. Isolates of <span class="yellow">UCBSV</span> from the Lake Victoria zone were placed to two phylogenetic clusters in accordance with their origin in Uganda or Tanzania, respectively. Mixed infections with <span class="yellow">CBSV</span> and <span class="yellow">UCBSV</span> were detected in many <span class="yellow">cassava</span> plants in the areas surveyed. <span class="yellow">CBSV</span> was also detected in the perennial species <span class="yellow">Manihot glaziovii</span> (DNA-barcoded in this study) in Tanzania, which revealed the first <span class="yellow">virus</span> reservoir other than <span class="yellow">cassava</span>. The method for detection of <span class="yellow">CBSV</span> and <span class="yellow">UCBSV</span> described in this study has important applications for plant quarantine, resistance breeding of <span class="yellow">cassava</span>, and studies on epidemiology and control of CBSD in East Africa. 
<h3>20923690</h3>Development of a blocking ELISA for detection of serum neutralizing antibodies against <span class="yellow">porcine circovirus type 2</span>. <br><br>A monoclonal antibody (Mab)-based blocking ELISA was developed for the detection of serum neutralizing antibodies to <span class="yellow">porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2)</span>. The Mab with neutralizing activity, which was produced by immunizing a recombinant capsid protein of PCV2 expressed in insect cells, was used as the detector antibody. The assay was evaluated in comparison with a serum neutralization assay, and its sensitivity and specificity were determined to be 98.8% and 88.5%, respectively. <span class="red">A</span> significant positive correlation was found between results of the blocking ELISA and the serum neutralization assay (r=0.9381). The assay was verified by testing experimental and commercial <span class="yellow">pig</span> sera. <span class="red">A</span> longitudinal antibody profile showed that serum neutralizing antibodies were detected 2 weeks after vaccination and that the detection rate reached 100% at 4 weeks. The serum neutralizing antibody profile showed a decrease from the age of 4 to 13 weeks, and seroconversion after 13 weeks in <span class="yellow">pigs</span> from a commercial <span class="yellow">pig</span> farm. Additionally, the positive detection rate in 703 sera collected from nine commercial <span class="yellow">pig</span> farms was 73%. This report demonstrates that the assay is a simple, specific, sensitive and convenient method for epidemiological surveys and evaluations of serum neutralizing antibodies against PCV2. 
<h3>20933017</h3>Adaptation of a Madin-Darby <span class="yellow">canine</span> kidney cell line to suspension growth in serum-free media and comparison of its ability to produce avian <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span> to Vero and BHK21 cell lines. <br><br>Madin-Darby <span class="yellow">canine</span> kidney (MDCK) cells are currently considered for <span class="yellow">influenza</span> vaccine manufacturing. <span class="red">A</span> drawback of these cells is their anchorage dependent growth, which greatly complicates process scale-up. In this paper a novel MDCK cell line (MDCK-SFS) is described that grows efficiently in suspension and retained high expression levels of both alpha-2,6 and alpha-2,3 sialic acid receptors, which bind preferably to <span class="yellow">human</span> and avian <span class="yellow">influenza viruses</span>, respectively. The production of avian <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span> by BHK21, Vero and MDCK-SFS cell lines was compared. Although BHK21 cells consisted of two populations, one of which lacks the alpha-2,3 receptor, they supported the replication of two <span class="yellow">influenza</span> strains to high titres. However, BHK21 cells are generally not applicable for <span class="yellow">influenza</span> production since they supported the replication of six further strains poorly. MDCK-SFS cells yielded the highest infectious <span class="yellow">virus</span> titres and <span class="yellow">virus</span> genome equivalent concentration for five of the eight <span class="yellow">influenza</span> strains analyzed and the highest hemagglutination activity for all eight <span class="yellow">virus</span> strains. Taken together with their suitability for suspension growth this makes the MDCK-SFS cell line potentially useful for large scale <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span> production. 
<h3>20951743</h3>Development and validation of a lateral flow immunoassay using colloidal gold for the identification of serotype-specific <span class="yellow">foot-and-mouth disease virus O</span>, <span class="blue">A</span> and <span class="yellow">Asia 1</span>. <br><br>A lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) was developed to identify and diagnose <span class="yellow">foot-and-mouth disease virus</span> (<span class="yellow">FMDV</span>) serotypes <span class="yellow">O</span>, <span class="blue">A</span> and <span class="yellow">Asia 1</span>. Antibodies obtained from <span class="yellow">rabbits</span> and guinea <span class="yellow">pigs</span> immunized with cell-culture-adapted <span class="yellow">virus</span> strains (<span class="yellow">O/CHA/99</span>, <span class="yellow">A/GS/LX/66</span>, <span class="yellow">Asia 1/CHN/05</span>) and suckling-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> adapted <span class="yellow">virus</span> strains (<span class="yellow">O/AV99(L)</span>, <span class="yellow">A/AV88(L)</span>, <span class="yellow">Asia 1/YNBS/58</span>) were used as capture antibodies. The diagnostic kit included three immunochromatographic strips of types <span class="yellow">O</span>, <span class="blue">A</span> and <span class="yellow">Asia 1</span>, and the type-specific results were confirmed by color on the test lines of the three strips. The LFI was evaluated using epithelial and vesicular samples (n=396) prepared from current and historical field samples (provide by the National Foot-and-Mouth Disease Reference Laboratory of China at Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute). Negative samples (n=95) were collected from healthy animals. The diagnostic sensitivity of the LFI for <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> serotypes <span class="yellow">O</span>, <span class="blue">A</span> and <span class="yellow">Asia 1</span> was 88.3% compared to 89.7% obtained by the reference method of indirect-sandwich ELISA. The sensitivity of the LFI for <span class="yellow">FMDV type Asia 1</span> was higher at 92.1% compared to 90.5% for the ELISA. The specificity of the LFI was 97.1% compared with 97.4%. 
<h3>20951744</h3>Implementation and validation of a sensitive PCR detection method in the eradication campaign against <span class="yellow">Aleutian mink disease virus</span>. <br><br><span class="yellow">Aleutian mink disease virus (AMDV)</span> is a severe progressive disease causing multiple different clinical syndromes in <span class="yellow">mink</span>. In Denmark, the disease is notifiable and under official control. The control programme, based on serological screening, has confined successfully <span class="yellow">AMDV</span> to the northern part of Denmark. However, re-infections and new introductions of <span class="yellow">virus</span> into farms require a confirmatory virological test to verify the positive test results of single animals and ultimately to investigate disease transmission. <span class="red">A</span> one step PCR amplifying a 374-base fragment of the NS1 gene of <span class="yellow">AMDV</span> was compared to the counter-current immune electrophoresis (CIE) routinely used in the serological screening programme. <span class="yellow">Mink</span> organs (n=299) obtained from 55 recently infected farms and 8 non-infected farms from 2008 to 2010 were tested by PCR, and the results were found to have a high correlation with the serological status of the <span class="yellow">mink</span>. The relative diagnostic sensitivity of the PCR was 94.7%, and the relative diagnostic specificity was 97.9% when read in parallel with the CIE. PCR positive samples were sequenced and phylogenetic analysis revealed high similarity within the analysed <span class="yellow">AMDV strains</span> and to <span class="yellow">AMDV strains</span> described previously. 
<h3>20951745</h3>A new method for detection of <span class="yellow">pandemic influenza virus</span> using High Resolution Melting analysis of the neuraminidase gene. <br><br>Diagnostic methods based upon exclusive detection of haemagglutinin do not detect sequence variation in other gene segments of the <span class="yellow">Influenza A virus</span>. <span class="red">A</span> complementary approach is described based upon high-resolution melting curve analysis of the neuraminidase gene, an approach with the potential ability to detect small changes in the neuraminidase sequence without the need for specific probes. 
<h3>20955227</h3>Minimum hydraulic safety leads to maximum water-use efficiency in a forage grass. <br><br>Understanding how water-use regulation relates to biomass accumulation is imperative for improving crop production in water-limited environments. Here, we examine how the vulnerability of xylem to water stress-induced cavitation and the coordination between water transport capacity and assimilation (A) influences diurnal water-use efficiency (WUE) and dry-matter production in <span class="yellow">Lolium perenne</span> L. - a commercial forage grass. Plants were exposed to a range of water stresses, causing up to 90% leaf death, by withholding water and then rewatering to observe the recovery process. Leaf hydraulic conductance (K(leaf) ) declined to 50% of maximum at a leaf water potential (psi(leaf) ) of -1 MPa, whereas complete stomatal closure occurred well after this point, at -2.35 MPa, providing no protection against hydraulic dysfunction. Instantaneous <span class="red">A</span> remained maximal until &gt;70% of hydraulic conductivity had been lost. Post-stress rewatering showed that 95% loss of K(leaf) could be incurred before the recovery of gas exchange exceeded 1 d, with a rapid transition to leaf death after this point. Plants exposed to sustained soil water deficits through restricted nightly watering regimes did not suffer cumulative losses in K(leaf) ; instead, psi(leaf) and gas exchange recovered diurnally. The effect was improved WUE during the day and optimal psi(leaf) during the night for the maintenance of growth. 
<h3>20961294</h3>Isolation and characterization of MAT genes in the symbiotic ascomycete <span class="yellow">Tuber melanosporum</span>. <br><br>* The genome of <span class="yellow">Tuber melanosporum</span> has recently been sequenced. Here, we used this information to identify genes involved in the reproductive processes of this edible fungus. The sequenced strain (Mel28) possesses only one of the two master genes required for mating, that is, the gene that codes for the high mobility group (HMG) transcription factor (MAT1-2-1), whereas it lacks the gene that codes for the protein containing the alpha-box- domain (MAT1-1-1), suggesting that this fungus is heterothallic. * <span class="red">A</span> PCR-based approach was initially employed to screen truffles for the presence of the MAT1-2-1 gene and amplify the conserved regions flanking the mating type (MAT) locus. The MAT1-1-1 gene was finally identified using primers designed from the conserved regions of strains that lack the MAT1-2-1 gene. * Mating type-specific primer pairs were developed to screen asci and gleba from truffles of different origins and to genotype single ascospores within the asci. These analyses provided definitive evidence that <span class="yellow">T. melanosporum</span> is a heterothallic species with a MAT locus that is organized similarly to those of ancient <span class="yellow">fungal</span> lineages. * <span class="red">A</span> greater understanding of the reproductive mechanisms that exist in Tuber spp. allows for optimization of <span class="yellow">truffle</span> plantation management strategies. 
<h3>20962079</h3>Blood myeloid dendritic cells from <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span>-infected individuals display a proapoptotic profile characterized by decreased Bcl-2 levels and by caspase-3+ frequencies that are associated with levels of plasma viremia and T cell activation in an exploratory study. <br><br>Reduced frequencies of myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cell (DC) subsets (mDCs and pDCs, respectively) have been observed in the peripheral blood of <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span>-infected individuals throughout the course of disease. Accumulation of DCs in lymph nodes (LNs) may partly account for the decreased numbers observed in blood, but increased DC death may also be a contributing factor. We used multiparameter flow cytometry to evaluate pro- and antiapoptotic markers in blood mDCs and pDCs from untreated <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span>-infected donors, from a subset of infected donors before and after receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), and from uninfected control donors. Blood mDCs, but not pDCs, from untreated <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span>-infected donors expressed lower levels of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 than DCs from uninfected donors. <span class="red">A</span> subset of <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span>-infected donors had elevated frequencies of proapoptotic caspase-3(+) blood mDCs, and positive correlations were observed between caspase-3(+) mDC frequencies and plasma <span class="yellow">viral</span> load and CD8(+) T-cell activation levels. Caspase-3(+) mDC frequencies, but not mDC Bcl-2 expression, were reduced with <span class="yellow">viral</span> suppression on ART. Apoptosis markers on DCs in blood and LN samples from a cohort of untreated, <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span>-infected donors with chronic disease were also evaluated. LN mDCs displayed higher levels of Bcl-2 and lower caspase-3(+) frequencies than did matched blood mDCs. Conversely, LN pDCs expressed lower Bcl-2 levels than their blood counterparts. In summary, blood mDCs from untreated <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span>-infected subjects displayed a proapoptotic profile that was partially reversed with <span class="yellow">viral</span> suppression, suggesting that DC death may be a factor contributing to blood DC depletion in the setting of chronic, untreated <span class="yellow">HIV</span> disease. 
<h3>20962084</h3>Modifications in the polymerase genes of a <span class="yellow">swine</span>-like triple-reassortant <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span> to generate live attenuated vaccines against 2009 pandemic <span class="yellow">H1N1 viruses</span>. <br><br>On 11 June 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the outbreaks caused by novel <span class="yellow">swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus</span> had reached pandemic proportions. The pandemic <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> (H1N1pdm) <span class="yellow">virus</span> is the predominant <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span> strain in the <span class="yellow">human</span> population. It has also crossed the species barriers and infected turkeys and <span class="yellow">swine</span> in several countries. Thus, the development of a vaccine that is effective in multiple animal species is urgently needed. We have previously demonstrated that the introduction of temperature-sensitive mutations into the PB2 and PB1 genes of an avian <span class="yellow">H9N2 virus</span>, combined with the insertion of a hemagglutinin (HA) tag in PB1, resulted in an attenuated (att) vaccine backbone for both <span class="yellow">chickens</span> and <span class="yellow">mice</span>. Because the new pandemic strain is a triple-reassortant (TR) <span class="yellow">virus</span>, we chose to introduce the double attenuating modifications into a <span class="yellow">swine</span>-like TR <span class="yellow">virus</span> isolate, <span class="yellow">A/turkey/OH/313053/04 (H3N2)</span> (ty/04), with the goal of producing live attenuated <span class="yellow">influenza</span> vaccines (LAIV). This genetically modified backbone had impaired polymerase activity and restricted <span class="yellow">virus</span> growth at elevated temperatures. In vivo characterization of two <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> vaccine candidates generated using the ty/04 att backbone demonstrated that this vaccine is highly attenuated in <span class="yellow">mice</span>, as indicated by the absence of signs of disease, limited replication, and minimum histopathological alterations in the respiratory tract. <span class="red">A</span> single immunization with the ty/04 att-based vaccines conferred complete protection against a lethal <span class="yellow">H1N1pdm</span><span class="yellow">H1N1pdm virus</span> infection in <span class="yellow">mice</span>. More importantly, vaccination of <span class="yellow">pigs</span> with a ty/04 att-H1N1 vaccine candidate resulted in sterilizing immunity upon an aggressive intratracheal challenge with the 2009 <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> pandemic <span class="yellow">virus</span>. Our studies highlight the safety of the ty/04 att vaccine platform and its potential as a master donor strain for the generation of live attenuated vaccines for <span class="yellow">humans</span> and livestock. 
<h3>20962085</h3>Novel F141L pre-S2 mutation in <span class="yellow">hepatitis B virus</span> increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic genotype C infections. <br><br>Several lines of evidence have suggested that some naturally occurring mutations of <span class="yellow">hepatitis B virus</span> (<span class="yellow">HBV</span>) play a critical role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we describe a novel HCC-related pre-S2 mutation, F141L. To prove the relationship between the F141L mutation and HCC, molecular epidemiology studies using MboII PCR restriction analysis (PRA) were performed, and the molecular mechanism was investigated through construction of a stable hepatocyte cell line expressing the large surface HB protein (LHB) with the F141L mutation (F141L-LHB). Application of MboII PRA to samples from 241 Korean patients with chronic liver diseases of different clinical stages confirmed that F141L mutants were significantly related to HCC, even in comparison to liver cirrhosis (HCC, 26.3% of patients, or 26/99; liver cirrhosis, 3.8% of patients, or 2/52; P = 0.001). By studying stable cell lines, we found that F141L-LHBs could induce cell cycle progression by downregulating the p53 and p21 pathways and upregulating CDK4 and cyclin <span class="red">A</span>. Furthermore, we found that in a colony-forming assay, the colony-forming rates in cell lines expressing F141L-LHBs were about twice as high as those of the wild type. In conclusion, our results suggest that F141L-LHBs may contribute importantly to the pathogenesis of HCC by inducing cell proliferation and transformation. So, the F141L mutation examined in this study could serve as a diagnostic marker for the prognosis of HCC. 
<h3>20962087</h3>The magnitude of local immunity in the lungs of <span class="yellow">mice</span> induced by live attenuated <span class="yellow">influenza</span> vaccines is determined by local <span class="yellow">viral</span> replication and induction of cytokines. <br><br>While live attenuated <span class="yellow">influenza</span> vaccines (LAIVs) have been shown to be efficacious and have been licensed for <span class="yellow">human</span> use, the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) have to be updated for optimal protective efficacy. Little is known about the effect of different HA and NA proteins on the immunogenicity of LAIVs developed using the same backbone. <span class="red">A</span> panel of LAIVs that share the internal protein genes, with unique HA and NA gene segments from different <span class="yellow">influenza</span> subtypes, was rescued by reverse genetics, and a comparative study of immune responses induced by these vaccines was conducted in <span class="yellow">mice</span>. The results suggest that the magnitude of lung immunity, including pulmonary IgA antibody and memory CD8(+) T lymphocytes, induced by the vaccines depends on the replication efficiency of the LAIVs, as well as the induction of cytokines/chemokines in the lungs. However, these factors are not important in determining systemic immunity such as serum antibody titers and memory CD8(+) T cells in the spleen. <span class="red">A</span> qualitative analysis of immune responses induced by a single dose of an <span class="yellow">H5N1</span> LAIV revealed that the vaccine induced robust systemic and mucosal immunity in <span class="yellow">mice</span>. In addition, antibodies and memory lymphocytes established in the lungs following vaccination were required for protection against lethal challenge with homologous and heterologous <span class="yellow">H5N1 viruses</span>. Our results highlight the different requirements for inducing systemic and lung immunity that can be explored for the development of pulmonary immunity for protection against respiratory pathogens. 
<h3>20971900</h3>Regulation and function of <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span> sugar efflux transporter <span class="red">A</span> (SetA) during glucose-phosphate stress. <br><br>Accumulation of certain nonmetabolizable sugar-phosphates (including alpha-methyl glucoside-6-phosphate) in <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span> is growth inhibitory and elicits the glucose-phosphate stress response. The transcription factor SgrR activates transcription of the small RNA SgrS under stress conditions. SgrS represses translation of mRNAs encoding sugar transporters. The sgrR and sgrS genes are located directly upstream of setA, and this gene organization is conserved in numerous enteric species, prompting the hypothesis that SetA contributes to the glucose-phosphate stress response. SetA is a proton motive force-driven efflux pump capable of transporting various sugars and sugar analogs in vitro. This study demonstrates that setA expression is induced in response to glucose-phosphate stress, and this requires SgrR. Under stress conditions, setA is cotranscribed with sgrS from the sgrS promoter. <span class="red">A</span> setA mutant exhibits a growth defect under stress conditions that can be complemented by setA in trans, suggesting that SetA contributes to the optimal cellular recovery from stress. Despite previous in vitro evidence that SetA can promote efflux of the stress-causing glucose analog alpha-methyl glucoside, in vivo data in this study indicate that SetA is not the major efflux pump responsible for removal of alpha-methyl glucoside under stress conditions. 
<h3>20971904</h3>Functional analysis of molybdopterin biosynthesis in mycobacteria identifies a fused molybdopterin synthase in <span class="yellow">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</span>. <br><br>Most mycobacterial species possess a full complement of genes for the biosynthesis of molybdenum cofactor (MoCo). However, a distinguishing feature of members of the <span class="yellow">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</span> complex is their possession of multiple homologs associated with the first two steps of the MoCo biosynthetic pathway. <span class="red">A</span> mutant of <span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span> lacking the moaA1-moaD1 gene cluster and a derivative in which moaD2 was also deleted were significantly impaired for growth in media containing nitrate as a sole nitrogen source, indicating a reduced availability of MoCo to support the assimilatory function of the MoCo-dependent nitrate reductase, NarGHI. However, the double mutant displayed residual respiratory nitrate reductase activity, suggesting that it retains the capacity to produce MoCo. The <span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span> moaD and moaE homologs were further analyzed by expressing these genes in mutant strains of <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span> that lacked one or both of the sole molybdopterin (MPT) synthase-encoding genes, moaD2 and moaE2, and were unable to grow on nitrate, presumably as a result of the loss of MoCo-dependent nitrate assimilatory activity. Expression of <span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span> moaD2 in the <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span> moaD2 mutant and of <span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span> moaE1 or moaE2 in the <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span> moaE2 mutant restored nitrate assimilation, confirming the functionality of these genes in MPT synthesis. Expression of <span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span> moaX also restored MoCo biosynthesis in <span class="yellow">M. smegmatis</span> mutants lacking moaD2, moaE2, or both, thus identifying MoaX as a fused MPT synthase. By implicating multiple synthase-encoding homologs in MoCo biosynthesis, these results suggest that important cellular functions may be served by their expansion in <span class="yellow">M. tuberculosis</span>.
<h3>20971906</h3>Plantazolicin, a novel microcin B17/streptolysin S-like natural product from <span class="yellow">Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42</span>. <br><br>Here we report on a novel thiazole/oxazole-modified microcin (TOMM) from <span class="yellow">Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42</span>, a Gram-positive soil bacterium. This organism is well known for stimulating plant growth and biosynthesizing complex small molecules that suppress the growth of bacterial and <span class="yellow">fungal</span> plant pathogens. Like microcin B17 and streptolysin S, the TOMM from <span class="yellow">B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42</span> undergoes extensive posttranslational modification to become a bioactive natural product. Our data show that the modified peptide bears a molecular mass of 1,335 Da and displays antibacterial activity toward closely related Gram-positive bacteria. <span class="red">A</span> cluster of 12 genes that covers -10 kb is essential for the production, modification, export, and self-immunity of this natural product. We have named this compound plantazolicin (PZN), based on the association of several producing organisms with plants and the incorporation of azole heterocycles, which derive from Cys, Ser, and Thr residues of the precursor peptide. 
<h3>20974179</h3>A combined method for rescue of modified enteroviruses by mutagenic primers, long PCR and T7 RNA polymerase-driven in vivo transcription. <br><br>The current methods for manipulation of enteroviral RNA genomes and production of modified <span class="yellow">virus</span> particles include stepwise subcloning procedures and in vitro transcription and RNA transfection steps that are both time-consuming and inefficient. Several enteroviral cDNA clones with 5'-terminal T7 promoter and <span class="yellow">coxsackievirus A9</span> (<span class="yellow">CAV9</span>) PCR product with the T7 promoter were transfected successfully into target cells expressing T7 RNA polymerase for the rescue of <span class="yellow">virus</span> particles. This demonstrated the overall feasibility of the in vivo transcription method. Furthermore, a rapid method using high-fidelity DNA polymerase, Phusion(TM), for amplification and mutagenesis of <span class="yellow">CAV9</span> cDNA was generated. <span class="red">A</span> long PCR method was employed together with mutagenic primers for direct introduction of a unique restriction enzyme site into the VP1-2A junction of the <span class="yellow">CAV9</span> cDNA clone during the PCR amplification process. Enhanced green fluorescent protein was subcloned to that site, and <span class="yellow">CAV9</span>-eGFP cDNA was transfected to the target cells for in vivo transcription and successful rescue of <span class="yellow">CAV9</span>-eGFP particles. The method allowed a straightforward mutagenesis and in vivo production of infectious enteroviral particles, and may be applicable routinely for rapid production of the modified picornaviruses over the use of the traditional subcloning protocols. 
<h3>20977507</h3>A novel class of miniature inverted repeat transposable elements (MITEs) that contain hitchhiking (GTCY)(n) microsatellites. <br><br>The movement of miniature inverted repeat transposable elements (MITEs) modifies genome structure and function. We describe the microsatellite-associated interspersed nuclear element 2 (MINE-2), that integrates at consensus WTTTT target sites, creates dinucleotide TT target site duplications (TSDs), and forms predicted MITE-like secondary structures; a 5' subterminal inverted repeat (SIR; AGGGTTCCGTAG) that is partially complementary to a 5' inverted repeat (IR; ACGAAGCCCT) and 3'-SIRs (TTACGGAACCCT). <span class="red">A</span> (GTCY)(n) microsatellite is hitchhiking downstream of conserved 5'MINE-2 secondary structures, causing flanking sequence similarity amongst mobile microsatellite loci. Transfection of insect cell lines indicates that MITE-like secondary structures are sufficient to mediate genome integration, and provides insight into the transposition mechanism used by MINE-2s. 
<h3>20980499</h3><span class="yellow">Poliovirus</span> RNA is released from the capsid near a twofold symmetry axis.<br><br>After recognizing and binding to its host cell, <span class="yellow">poliovirus</span> (like other nonenveloped viruses) faces the challenge of translocating its genome across a cellular membrane and into the cytoplasm. To avoid entanglement with the capsid, the RNA must exit via a single site on the virion surface. However, the mechanism by which a single site is selected (from among 60 equivalents) is unknown; and until now, even its location on the virion surface has been controversial. To help to elucidate the mechanism of infection, we have used single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and tomography to reconstruct conformationally altered intermediates that are formed by the poliovirion at various stages of the <span class="yellow">poliovirus</span> infection process. Recently, we reported icosahedrally symmetric structures for two forms of the end-state 80S empty capsid particle. Surprisingly, RNA was frequently visible near the capsid; and in a subset of the virions, RNA was seen on both the inside and outside of the capsid, caught in the act of exiting. To visualize RNA exiting, we have now determined asymmetric reconstructions from that subset, using both single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomographic methods, producing independent reconstructions at -50-A resolution. Contrary to predictions in the literature, the footprint of RNA on the capsid surface is located close to a <span class="yellow">viral</span> 2-fold axis, covering a slot-shaped area of reduced density that is present in both of the symmetrized 80S reconstructions and which extends by about 20 <span class="red">A</span> away from the 2-fold axis toward each neighboring 5-fold axis. 
<h3>20980520</h3>Persistent <span class="yellow">Friend virus</span> replication and disease in Apobec3-deficient <span class="yellow">mice</span> expressing functional B-cell-activating factor receptor. <br><br>Rfv3 is an autosomal dominant gene that influences the recovery of resistant <span class="yellow">mice</span> from <span class="yellow">Friend retrovirus</span> (<span class="yellow">FV</span>) infection by limiting viremia and promoting a more potent neutralizing antibody response. We previously reported that Rfv3 is encoded by Apobec3, an innate retrovirus restriction factor. However, it was recently suggested that the Rfv3 susceptible phenotype of high viremia at 28 days postinfection (dpi) was more dominantly controlled by the B-cell-activating factor receptor (BAFF-R), a gene that is linked to but located outside the genetically mapped region containing Rfv3. Although one prototypical Rfv3 susceptible <span class="yellow">mouse</span> strain, A/WySn, indeed contains a dysfunctional BAFF-R, two other Rfv3 susceptible strains, BALB/c and <span class="red">A</span>.BY, express functional BAFF-R genes, determined on the basis of genotyping and B-cell immunophenotyping. Furthermore, transcomplementation studies in (C57BL/6 [B6] x BALB/c)F(1) and (B6 x <span class="red">A</span>.BY)F(1) <span class="yellow">mice</span> revealed that the B6 Apobec3 gene significantly influences recovery from <span class="yellow">FV</span> viremia, cellular infection, and disease at 28 dpi. Finally, the Rfv3 phenotypes of prototypic B6, <span class="red">A</span>.BY, A/WySn, and BALB/c <span class="yellow">mouse</span> strains correlate with reported Apobec3 mRNA expression levels. Overall, these findings argue against the generality of BAFF-R polymorphisms as a dominant mechanism to explain the Rfv3 recovery phenotype and further strengthen the evidence that Apobec3 encodes Rfv3. 
<h3>20980521</h3>Characterization of cross-reactive CD8+ T-cell recognition of HLA-A2-restricted HIV-Gag (SLYNTVATL) and HCV-NS5b (ALYDVVSKL) epitopes in individuals infected with <span class="yellow">human immunodeficiency</span> and <span class="yellow">hepatitis C viruses</span>. <br><br>The immunologic mechanisms underlying the faster progression of <span class="yellow">hepatitis C virus</span> (<span class="yellow">HCV</span>) disease in the presence of <span class="yellow">human immunodeficiency virus</span> (<span class="yellow">HIV</span>) coinfection are not clearly understood. T-cell cross-reactivity between <span class="yellow">HCV</span> and <span class="yellow">influenza</span> virus-specific epitopes has been associated with rapid progression of <span class="yellow">HCV</span> disease (S. Urbani, B. Amadei, P. Fisicaro, M. Pilli, G. Missale, <span class="red">A</span>. Bertoletti, and C. Ferrari, J. Exp. Med. 201:675-680, 2005). We asked whether T-cell cross-reactivity between <span class="yellow">HCV</span> and <span class="yellow">HIV</span> could exist during <span class="yellow">HCV</span>/<span class="yellow">HIV</span> coinfection and affect pathogenesis. Our search for amino acid sequence homology between the <span class="yellow">HCV</span> and <span class="yellow">HIV</span> proteomes revealed two similar HLA-A2-restricted epitopes, HIV-Gag (SLYNTVATL [HIV-SL9]) and <span class="yellow">HCV</span>-NS5b (ALYDVVSKL [<span class="yellow">HCV</span>-AL9]). We found that 4 out of 20 HLA-A2-positive (HLA-A2(+)) <span class="yellow">HIV</span>-infected individuals had CD8(+) T cells that recognized both the <span class="yellow">HIV</span>-SL9 and HCV-AL9 epitopes. However, the AL9 epitope was generally shown to be a weak agonist. Although HCV-monoinfected individuals in our study did not show AL9-specific responses, we found that about half of HCV/<span class="yellow">HIV</span>-coinfected individuals had dual responses to both epitopes. High dual T-cell recognition among coinfected subjects was usually due to separate T-cell populations targeting each epitope, as determined by pentamer staining. The one individual demonstrating cross-reactive T cells to both epitopes showed the most advanced degree of liver disease. In coinfected individuals, we observed a positive correlation between the magnitudes of T-cell responses to both the SL9 and the AL9 epitopes, which was also positively associated with the clinical parameter of liver damage. Thus, we find that <span class="yellow">HIV</span> infection induces T cells that can cross-react to heterologous viruses or prime for T cells that are closely related in sequence. However, the induction of cross-reactive T cells may not be associated with control of disease caused by the heterologous <span class="yellow">virus</span>. This demonstrates that degeneracy of HIV-specific T cells may play a role in the immunopathology of <span class="yellow">HCV</span>/<span class="yellow">HIV</span> coinfection. 
<h3>20980524</h3>Association of TRIM22 with the type 1 interferon response and <span class="yellow">viral</span> control during primary <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span> infection. <br><br>Type 1 interferons (IFNs) induce the expression of the tripartite interaction motif (TRIM) family of E3 ligases, but the contribution of these antiviral factors to <span class="yellow">HIV</span> pathogenesis is not completely understood. We hypothesized that the increased expression of select type 1 IFN and TRIM isoforms is associated with a significantly lower likelihood of <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span> acquisition and <span class="yellow">viral</span> control during primary <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span> infection. We measured IFN-alpha, IFN-Beta, myxovirus resistance protein <span class="red">A</span> (MxA), <span class="yellow">human</span> TRIM5alpha (huTRIM5alpha), and TRIM22 mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of high-risk, <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span>-uninfected participants and <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span>-positive study participants. Samples were available for 32 uninfected subjects and 28 infected persons, all within 1 year of infection. <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span>-positive participants had higher levels of IFN-Beta (P = 0.0005), MxA (P = 0.007), and TRIM22 (P = 0.01) and lower levels of huTRIM5alpha (P &lt; 0.001) than did <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span>-negative participants. TRIM22 but not huTRIM5alpha correlated positively with type 1 IFN (IFN-alpha, IFN-Beta, and MxA) (all P &lt; 0.0001). In a multivariate model, increased MxA expression showed a significant positive association with <span class="yellow">viral</span> load (P = 0.0418). Furthermore, TRIM22 but not huTRIM5alpha, IFN-alpha, IFN-Beta, or MxA showed a negative correlation with plasma <span class="yellow">viral</span> load (P = 0.0307) and a positive correlation with CD4(+) T-cell counts (P = 0.0281). In vitro studies revealed that <span class="yellow">HIV</span> infection induced TRIM22 expression in PBMCs obtained from <span class="yellow">HIV</span>-negative donors. Stable TRIM22 knockdown resulted in increased <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span> particle release and replication in Jurkat reporter cells. Collectively, these data suggest concordance between type 1 IFN and TRIM22 but not huTRIM5alpha expression in PBMCs and that TRIM22 likely acts as an antiviral effector in vivo. 
<h3>20980525</h3>Determinants that specify the integration pattern of retrotransposon Tf1 in the fbp1 promoter of <span class="yellow">Schizosaccharomyces pombe</span>. <br><br>Long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons are closely related to retroviruses and, as such, are important models for the study of <span class="yellow">viral</span> integration and target site selection. The transposon Tf1 of <span class="yellow">Schizosaccharomyces pombe</span> integrates with a strong preference for the promoters of polymerase II (Pol II)-transcribed genes. Previous work in vivo with plasmid-based targets revealed that the patterns of insertion were promoter specific and highly reproducible. To determine which features of promoters are recognized by Tf1, we studied integration in a promoter that has been characterized. The promoter of fbp1 has two upstream activating sequences, UAS1 and UAS2. We found that integration was targeted to two windows, one 180 nucleotides (nt) upstream and the other 30 to 40 nt downstream of UAS1. <span class="red">A</span> series of deletions in the promoter showed that the integration activities of these two regions functioned autonomously. Integration assays of UAS2 and of a synthetic promoter demonstrated that strong promoter activity alone was not sufficient to direct integration. The factors that modulate the transcription activities of UAS1 and UAS2 include the activators Atf1p, Pcr1p, and Rst2p as well as the repressors Tup11p, Tup12p, and Pka1p. Strains lacking each of these proteins revealed that Atf1p alone mediated the sites of integration. These data indicate that Atf1p plays a direct and specific role in targeting integration in the promoter of fbp1. 
<h3>21029750</h3>Detection of <span class="yellow">infectious myonecrosis virus</span> using monoclonal antibody specific to N and C fragments of the capsid protein expressed heterologously. <br><br>The gene encoding the capsid protein in ORF1 of the genome of <span class="yellow">infectious myonecrosis virus</span> (<span class="yellow">IMNV</span>) (GenBank AY570982) was amplified into three parts named CP-N (nucleotides 2248-3045), CP-I (nucleotides 3046-3954) and CP-C (nucleotides 3955-4953). The CP-N fragment was inserted into expression vector pTYB1 while CP-I and CP-C were each inserted into expression vector pGEX-6P-1 for transformation of <span class="yellow">BL21 E. coli</span> strain. After induction, intein-CP-N (84 kDa), glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-CP-I (60 kDa) and GST-CP-C (62 kDa) fusion proteins were produced. They were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroeluted before immunization of Swiss <span class="yellow">mice</span> for monoclonal antibody (MAb) production. Two MAbs specific to CP-N and one MAb specific to CP-C were selected for use for detection of natural <span class="yellow">IMNV</span> infections in <span class="yellow">Penaeus vannamei</span> by dot blotting, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. There was no cross-reaction with shrimp tissues or common shrimp viruses including <span class="yellow">white spot syndrome virus</span> (<span class="yellow">WSSV</span>), <span class="yellow">yellow head virus</span> (<span class="yellow">YHV</span>), <span class="yellow">Taura syndrome virus</span> (<span class="yellow">TSV</span>), <span class="yellow">Penaeus monodon nucleopolyhedrovirus</span> (<span class="yellow">PemoNPV</span>), <span class="yellow">Penaeus stylirostris</span> densovirus (PstDNV) and Penaeus monodon densovirus (PmDNV). The detection sensitivities of the MAbs were approximately 6 fmol/spot of purified recombinant intein-CP-N protein and 8 fmol/spot of GST-CP-C as determined by dot blotting. <span class="red">A</span> combination of all three MAbs resulted in a twofold increase in sensitivity over use of any single MAb. However, this sensitivity was approximately 10 times lower than that of one-step RT-PCR using the same sample. Immunohistochemical analysis using MAbs specific to CP-N and CP-C in <span class="yellow">IMNV</span>-infected shrimp revealed intense staining patterns in muscles, the lymphoid organ, gills, the heart, hemocytes and connective tissue. 
<h3>21029752</h3>Multiplex PCR for rapid detection of <span class="yellow">serotype A foot-and-mouth disease virus</span> variants with amino acid deletion at position 59 of the capsid protein VP3. <br><br>In India, there has been co-circulation, extinction and emergence of genotypes/lineages within <span class="yellow">serotype A</span><span class="red">A</span> foot-and-mouth disease (<span class="yellow">FMD</span>) <span class="yellow">virus</span>. At present an antigenically heterogeneous, unique lineage within genotype VII dominates the field outbreaks. This genetic cluster has amino acid deletion at position 59 of VP3 (VP3(59)-deletion group), considered to be critical antigenically. The emergence of this group warrants rapid and accurate detection to facilitate early planning and implementation of an effective control policy. <span class="red">A</span> rapid multiplex PCR assay was developed for detection of the dominating VP3(59)-deletion group with 100% sensitivity and specificity, even before generating sequence data and confirmatory phylogenetic analysis. This development is important for surveillance of <span class="yellow">FMD</span> in India. 
<h3>21034772</h3>Multiplex RT-PCR for rapid detection and differentiation of <span class="yellow">class I</span> and <span class="yellow">class II Newcastle disease viruses</span>. <br><br>A multiplex RT-PCR was developed for detection and differentiation of <span class="yellow">class I</span> and <span class="yellow">class II strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV)</span>. The method was shown to have high specificity and sensitivity. The results obtained from the multiplex RT-PCR for a total of 67 <span class="yellow">NDV</span> field isolates obtained in 2009 were consistent with those obtained by nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. <span class="red">A</span> phylogenetic tree based on the partial sequences of the F gene revealed that the 67 field isolates of <span class="yellow">NDV</span> could be divided into two classes. Twenty-seven <span class="yellow">NDV</span><span class="yellow">NDV isolates</span> were grouped into <span class="yellow">class I</span>, and two genotypes were identified. Most of the <span class="yellow">class I</span> isolates were determined to be of genotype 3, with the exception of isolate <span class="yellow">NDV09-034</span>, which belonged to genotype 2. Forty <span class="yellow">class II NDV isolates</span> were divided into three genotypes, namely genotype VII (27 isolates), genotype I (2 isolates) and genotype II (11 isolates). Isolates of genotypes I and II in class II were shown to be related to commercial vaccine strains used commonly in China. All isolates of genotype VII were predicted to be virulent, on the basis of the sequence motif at the cleavage site of the F gene. This genotype has become predominantly responsible for most outbreaks of ND in China in recent years. In conclusion, this multiplex RT-PCR provides a new assay for rapid detection and differentiation of both classes of <span class="yellow">NDV isolates</span>. 
<h3>21034774</h3>Detection of <span class="yellow">Tomato black ring virus</span> by real-time one-step RT-PCR.<br><br>A TaqMan-based real-time one-step RT-PCR assay was developed for the rapid detection of <span class="yellow">Tomato black ring virus</span> (<span class="yellow">TBRV</span>), a significant plant pathogen which infects a wide range of economically important crops. Primers and a probe were designed against existing genomic sequences to amplify a 72 bp fragment from RNA-2. The assay amplified all isolates of <span class="yellow">TBRV</span> tested, but no amplification was observed from the RNA of other nepovirus species or healthy host plants. The detection limit of the assay was estimated to be around nine copies of the <span class="yellow">TBRV</span> target region in total RNA. <span class="red">A</span> comparison with conventional RT-PCR and ELISA, indicated that ELISA, the current standard test method, lacked specificity and reacted to all nepovirus species tested, while conventional RT-PCR was approximately ten-fold less sensitive than the real-time RT-PCR assay. Finally, the real-time RT-PCR assay was tested using five different RT-PCR reagent kits and was found to be robust and reliable, with no significant differences in sensitivity being found. The development of this rapid assay should aid in quarantine and post-border surveys for regulatory agencies. 
<h3>21036992</h3>Catabolite control protein <span class="red">A</span> controls hydrogen peroxide production and cell death in <span class="yellow">Streptococcus sanguinis</span>. <br><br><span class="yellow">Streptococcus sanguinis</span> is a commensal oral bacterium producing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) that is dependent on pyruvate oxidase (Spx) activity. In addition to its well-known role in bacterial antagonism during interspecies competition, H2O2 causes cell death in about 10% of the <span class="yellow">S. sanguinis</span> population. As a consequence of H2O2-induced cell death, largely intact chromosomal DNA is released into the environment. This extracellular DNA (eDNA) contributes to the self-aggregation phenotype under aerobic conditions. To further investigate the regulation of spx gene expression, we assessed the role of catabolite control protein <span class="red">A</span> (CcpA) in spx expression control. We report here that CcpA represses spx expression. An isogenic DeltaccpA mutant showed elevated spx expression, increased Spx abundance, and H2O2 production, whereas the wild type did not respond with altered spx expression in the presence of glucose and other carbohydrates. Since H2O2 is directly involved in the release of eDNA and bacterial cell death, the presented data suggest that CcpA is a central control element in this important developmental process in <span class="yellow">S. sanguinis</span>. 
<h3>21037014</h3>Characterization of the Bacteroides CTnDOT regulatory protein RteC.<br><br>Excision of the Bacteroides conjugative transposon CTnDOT is stimulated by tetracycline. It was shown previously that a gene, rteC, is necessary for tetracycline-stimulated transcriptional regulation of the orf2c operon, which contains the excision genes. The protein encoded by this gene, RteC, did not have primary amino acid sequence homology to any known proteins in the databases. Accordingly, we sought structural homologs of RteC. <span class="red">A</span> three-dimensional structure prediction by Robetta suggested that RteC might have two domains and that the C-terminal domain might have a winged helix motif. Based on the Robetta prediction, the <span class="yellow">human</span> transcriptional factors E2F-4 and DP2 were identified as the most likely structural homologs of RteC. We made alanine substitutions within the putative DNA binding helix 3 region of RteC. Assays of orf2c::uidA activation by alanine mutants indicated that residues 174, 175, 178, 180, and 184 in helix 3 might contact the upstream region of P(E). The upstream region of orf2c contained two inverted-repeat half sites. Mutational analysis of these half sites showed that both half sites are important for activity. Thus, we have identified the DNA binding portion of RteC and the DNA site to which it binds. 
<h3>21039565</h3>Aerenchyma formation in the <span class="yellow">rice</span> stem and its promotion by H2O2.<br><br>* Gas spaces (aerenchyma) form as an adaptation to submergence to facilitate gas exchange. In <span class="yellow">rice</span> (<span class="yellow">Oryza sativa</span>), aerenchyma develop by cell death and lysis, which are poorly understood at the cellular level. * Aerenchyma formation was studied in <span class="yellow">rice</span> stems by light microscopy. It was analyzed in response to submergence, ethylene and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) treatment, and in the MT2b::Tos17 mutant. O(2)*(-) was detected with nitroblue tetrazolium and an epinephrine assay. H(2)O(2) was detected with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine. * Aerenchyma develop constitutively in all internodes of the deep-water <span class="yellow">rice</span> variety Pin Gaew 56, but are absent from the nodes. Constitutive aerenchyma formation was also observed in two lowland <span class="yellow">rice</span> varieties, albeit to a lesser degree. <span class="red">A</span> larger number of aerenchyma are present in older internodes, and at the top of each internode, revealing developmental gradients. Submergence or treatment with the ethylene-releasing compound ethephon promoted aerenchyma formation in all genotypes analyzed. Pre-aerenchymal cells contain less starch, no chloroplasts, thinner cell walls and produce elevated levels of O(2)*(-) and H(2)O(2) compared with other parenchymal cells. Ethephon promotes O(2)*(-) formation and H(2)O(2) promotes aerenchyma formation in a dose-dependent manner. Further-more, genetic downregulation of the H(2)O(2) scavenger MT2b enhances aerenchyma formation. * Aerenchyma formation is mediated by reactive oxygen species. 
<h3>21039568</h3>Identification of a novel mitochondrial protein, short postembryonic roots 1 (SPR1), involved in root development and iron homeostasis in <span class="yellow">Oryza sativa</span>. <br><br>* <span class="red">A</span> <span class="yellow">rice</span> mutant, <span class="yellow">Oryza sativa short postembryonic roots 1</span> (<span class="yellow">Osspr1</span>), has been characterized. It has short postembryonic roots, including adventitious and lateral roots, and a lower iron content in its leaves. * <span class="yellow">OsSPR1</span> was identified by map-based cloning. It encodes a novel mitochondrial protein with the Armadillo-like repeat domain. * <span class="yellow">Osspr1</span> mutants exhibited decreased root cell elongation. The iron content of the mutant shoots was significantly altered compared with that of wild-type shoots. <span class="red">A</span> similar pattern of alteration of manganese and zinc concentrations in shoots was also observed. Complementation of the mutant confirmed that <span class="yellow">OsSPR1</span> is involved in post-embryonic root elongation and iron homeostasis in <span class="yellow">rice</span>. <span class="yellow">OsSPR1</span> was found to be ubiquitously expressed in various tissues throughout the plant. The transcript abundance of various genes involved in iron uptake and signaling via both strategies I and II was similar in roots of wild-type and mutant plants, but was higher in the leaves of mutant plants. * Thus, a novel mitochondrial protein that is involved in root elongation and plays a role in metal ion homeostasis has been identified. 
<h3>21039570</h3>Genomic profiling of carbohydrate metabolism in the ectomycorrhizal fungus <span class="yellow">Tuber melanosporum</span>.<br><br>* Primary carbohydrate metabolism plays a special role related to carbon/nitrogen exchange, as well as metabolic support of fruiting body development, in ectomycorrhizal macrofungi. In this study, we used information retrieved from the recently sequenced <span class="yellow">Tuber melanosporum</span> genome, together with transcriptome analysis data and targeted validation experiments, to construct the first genome-wide catalogue of the proteins supporting carbohydrate metabolism in a plant-symbiotic ascomycete. * More than 100 genes coding for enzymes of the glycolysis, pentose phosphate, tricarboxylic acid, glyoxylate and methylcitrate pathways, glycogen, trehalose and mannitol metabolism and cell wall precursor were annotated. Transcriptional regulation of these pathways in different stages of the <span class="yellow">T. melanosporum</span> lifecycle was investigated using whole-genome oligoarray expression data together with real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of selected genes. * The most significant results were the identification of methylcitrate cycle genes and of an acid invertase, the first enzyme of this kind to be described in a plant-symbiotic filamentous fungus. * <span class="red">A</span> subset of transcripts coding for trehalose, glyoxylate and methylcitrate enzymes was up-regulated in fruiting bodies, whereas genes involved in mannitol and glycogen metabolism were preferentially expressed in mycelia and ectomycorrhizas, respectively. These data indicate a high degree of lifecycle stage specialization for particular branches of carbohydrate metabolism in <span class="yellow">T. melanosporum</span>. 
<h3>21062318</h3>Involvement of extracellular oxidative burst in salicylic acid-induced stomatal closure in <span class="yellow">Arabidopsis</span>. <br><br>Salicylic acid (SA), a ubiquitous phenolic phytohormone, is involved in many plant physiological processes including stomatal movement. We analysed SA-induced stomatal closure, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO), cytosolic calcium ion ([Ca^2+](cyt)) oscillations and inward-rectifying potassium (K+(in)) channel activity in <span class="yellow">Arabidopsis</span>. SA-induced stomatal closure was inhibited by pre-treatment with catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), suggesting the involvement of extracellular ROS. <span class="red">A</span> peroxidase inhibitor, SHAM (salicylhydroxamic acid) completely abolished SA-induced stomatal closure whereas neither an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase (DPI) nor atrbohD atrbohF mutation impairs SA-induced stomatal closures. 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) and nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) stainings demonstrated that SA induced H2O2 and O2- production. Guard cell ROS accumulation was significantly increased by SA, but that ROS was suppressed by exogenous CAT, SOD and SHAM. NO scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO) suppressed the SA-induced stomatal closure but did not suppress guard cell ROS accumulation whereas SHAM suppressed SA-induced NO production. SA failed to induce [Ca^2+](cyt) oscillations in guard cells whereas K+(in) channel activity was suppressed by SA. These results indicate that SA induces stomatal closure accompanied with extracellular ROS production mediated by SHAM-sensitive peroxidase, intracellular ROS accumulation and K+(in) channel inactivation. 
<h3>21073455</h3>Effects of early horn growth on reproduction and hunting mortality in female <span class="yellow">chamois</span>. <br><br>1. Environmental conditions during early development can affect the growth patterns of vertebrates, influencing future survival and reproduction. In long-lived mammals, females that experience poor environmental conditions early in life may delay primiparity. In female bovids, annual horn growth increments may provide a record of age-specific reproduction and body growth. Horn length, however, may also be a criterion used by hunters in selecting animals to harvest, possibly leading to artificial selection. 2. We studied three populations of <span class="yellow">chamois</span> (<span class="yellow">Rupicapra rupicapra</span>) in the western Alps to explore the relationships between female horn length and early growth, age of primiparity and age-specific reproduction. We also compared the risk of harvest to reproductive status and horn length. 3. Early horn growth was positively correlated with body mass in pre-reproductive females and with reproduction in very young and senescent adults. Females with strong early horn growth attained primiparity at an earlier age than those with weak early growth. Horn length did not affect hunter selection, but we found a strong hunter preference for nonlactating females. 4. Our research highlights the persistent effects of early development on reproductive performance in mammals. Moderate sport harvests are unlikely to affect the evolution of phenotypic traits and reproductive strategies in female <span class="yellow">chamois</span>. <span class="red">A</span> policy of penalizing hunters that harvest lactating females, however, may increase the harvest of 2-year-old females, which have high reproductive potential. 
<h3>21075927</h3>XerCD-mediated site-specific recombination leads to loss of the 57-kilobase gonococcal genetic island. <br><br>Most strains of <span class="yellow">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</span> carry the 57-kb gonococcal genetic island (GGI), as do a few strains of <span class="yellow">Neisseria meningitidis</span>. The GGI is inserted into the chromosome at the dif site (difA) and is flanked by a partial repeat of the dif site (difB). Since dif is a sequence recognized by the site-specific recombinases XerC and XerD and the GGI shows evidence of horizontal acquisition, we hypothesized that the GGI may be acquired or lost by XerCD-mediated site-specific recombination. We show that while the GGI flanked by wild-type dif sites, difA and difB, is not readily lost from the gonococcal chromosome, the substitution of difB with another copy of difA allows the frequent excision and loss of the GGI. In mutants carrying two difA sites (difA(+) difA(+)), the GGI can be detected as an extrachromosomal circle that exists transiently. <span class="red">A</span> mutation of xerD diminished GGI excision from the chromosome of a difA(+) difA(+) strain, while mutations in recA or type IV secretion genes had no effect on the loss of the GGI. These data indicate that the GGI is maintained by the replication of the chromosome and that GGI excision and loss are dependent upon the dif sequence and xerD. The detection of a circular form of the GGI in a wild-type strain suggests that GGI excision may occur naturally and could function to facilitate GGI transfer. These data suggest a model of GGI excision and loss explaining the absence of the GGI from some gonococcal strains and the maintenance of variant GGIs in some gonococcal and <span class="yellow">meningococcal</span> isolates. 
<h3>21087459</h3>Primate communities are structured more by dispersal limitation than by niches.<br><br>1. <span class="red">A</span> major goal in community ecology is to identify mechanisms that govern the assembly and maintenance of ecological communities. Current models of metacommunity dynamics differ chiefly in the relative emphasis placed on dispersal limitation and niche differentiation as causal mechanisms structuring ecological communities. Herein we investigate the relative roles of these two mechanisms in structuring primate communities in Africa, South America, Madagascar and Borneo. 2. We hypothesized that if dispersal limitation is important in structuring communities, then community similarity should depend on geographical proximity even after controlling for ecological similarity. Conversely, if communities are assembled primarily through niche processes, then community similarity should be determined by ecological similarity regardless of geographical proximity. 3. We performed Mantel and partial Mantel tests to investigate correlations among primate community similarity, ecological distance and geographical distance. Results showed significant and strongly negative relationships between diurnal primate community similarity and both ecological similarity and geographical distance in Madagascar, but significant and stronger negative relationships between community similarity and geographical distance in African, South American and Bornean metacommunities. 4. We conclude that dispersal limitation is an important determinant of primate community structure and may play a stronger role in shaping the structure of some terrestrial vertebrate communities than niche differentiation. These patterns are consistent with neutral theory. We recommend tests of functional equivalence to determine the extent to which neutral theory may explain primate community composition. 
<h3>21097609</h3>Structural and functional insights into <span class="yellow">Aeropyrum pernix</span> OppA, a member of a novel archaeal OppA subfamily. <br><br>In this study we gain insight into the structural and functional characterization of the <span class="yellow">Aeropyrum pernix</span> oligopeptide-binding protein (OppA(Ap)) previously identified from the extracellular medium of an <span class="yellow">Aeropyrum pernix</span> cell culture at late stationary phase. OppA(Ap) showed an N-terminal Q32 in a pyroglutamate form and C-terminal processing at the level of a threonine-rich region probably involved in protein membrane anchoring. Moreover, the OppA(Ap) protein released into the medium was identified as a &quot;nicked&quot; form composed of two tightly associated fragments detachable only under strong denaturing conditions. The cleavage site E569-G570 seems be located on an exposed surface loop that is highly conserved in several three-dimensional (3D) structures of dipeptide/oligopeptide-binding proteins from different sources. Structural and biochemical properties of the nicked protein were virtually indistinguishable from those of the intact form. Indeed, studies of the entire bacterially expressed OppA(Ap) protein owning the same N and C termini of the nicked form supported these findings. Moreover, in the middle exponential growth phase, OppA(Ap) was found as an intact cell membrane-associated protein. Interestingly, the native exoprotein OppA(Ap) was copurified with a hexapeptide (EKFKIV) showing both lysines methylated and possibly originating from an <span class="red">A</span>. pernix endogenous stress-induced lipoprotein. Therefore, the involvement of OppA(Ap) in the recycling of endogenous proteins was suggested to be a potential physiological function. Finally, a new OppA from <span class="yellow">Sulfolobus solfataricus</span>, SSO1288, was purified and preliminarily characterized, allowing the identification of a common structural/genetic organization shared by all &quot;true&quot; archaeal OppA proteins of the dipeptide/oligopeptide class. 
<h3>21097618</h3>Spatial regulation of histidine kinases governing biofilm formation in <span class="yellow">Bacillus subtilis</span>. <br><br><span class="yellow">Bacillus subtilis</span> is able to form architecturally complex biofilms on solid medium due to the production of an extracellular matrix. <span class="red">A</span> master regulator that controls the expression of the genes involved in matrix synthesis is Spo0A, which is activated by phosphorylation via a phosphorelay involving multiple histidine kinases. Here we report that four kinases, KinA, KinB, KinC, and KinD, help govern biofilm formation but that their contributions are partially masked by redundancy. We show that the kinases fall into two categories and that the members of each pair (one pair comprising KinA and KinB and the other comprising KinC and KinD) are partially redundant with each other. We also show that the kinases are spatially regulated: KinA and KinB are active principally in the older, inner regions of the colony, and KinC and KinD function chiefly in the younger, outer regions. These conclusions are based on the morphology of kinase mutants, real-time measurements of gene expression using luciferase as a reporter, and confocal microscopy using a fluorescent protein as a reporter. Our findings suggest that multiple signals from the older and younger regions of the colony are integrated by the kinases to determine the overall architecture of the biofilm community. 
<h3>21097629</h3>Genome copy numbers and gene conversion in <span class="yellow">methanogenic archaea</span>.<br><br>Previous studies revealed that one species of <span class="yellow">methanogenic archaea</span>, <span class="yellow">Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</span>, is polyploid, while a second species, <span class="yellow">Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus</span>, is diploid. To further investigate the distribution of ploidy in <span class="yellow">methanogenic archaea</span>, species of two additional genera-<span class="yellow">Methanosarcina acetivorans</span> and <span class="yellow">Methanococcus maripaludis</span>-were investigated. <span class="yellow">M. acetivorans</span> was found to be polyploid during fast growth (t(D) = 6 h; 17 genome copies) and oligoploid during slow growth (doubling time = 49 h; 3 genome copies). <span class="yellow">M. maripaludis</span> has the highest ploidy level found for any archaeal species, with up to 55 genome copies in exponential phase and ca. 30 in stationary phase. <span class="red">A</span> compilation of archaeal species with quantified ploidy levels reveals a clear dichotomy between Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota: none of seven euryarchaeal species of six genera is monoploid (haploid), while, in contrast, all six crenarchaeal species of four genera are monoploid, indicating significant genetic differences between these two kingdoms. Polyploidy in asexual species should lead to accumulation of inactivating mutations until the number of intact chromosomes per cell drops to zero (called &quot;Muller's ratchet&quot;). <span class="red">A</span> mechanism to equalize the genome copies, such as gene conversion, would counteract this phenomenon. Making use of a previously constructed heterozygous mutant strain of the polyploid <span class="yellow">M. maripaludis</span> we could show that in the absence of selection very fast equalization of genomes in <span class="yellow">M. maripaludis</span> took place probably via a gene conversion mechanism. In addition, it was shown that the velocity of this phenomenon is inversely correlated to the strength of selection. 
<h3>21118326</h3>Molecular structure of the prothoracicotropic hormone gene in the <span class="yellow">northern house mosquito</span>, <span class="yellow">Culex pipiens</span>, and its expression analysis in association with diapause and blood feeding. <br><br>We cloned the gene that encodes prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) in the <span class="yellow">northern house mosquito</span>, <span class="yellow">Culex pipiens</span>, and investigated its expression profile in short-day (diapause-destined) and long-day (nondiapause-destined) individuals from the fourth-instar larval stage to 2 months of adulthood, as well as after a blood meal. The deduced <span class="yellow">C. pipiens</span> PTTH (Cupip-PTTH) amino acid sequence contains seven cysteines with a specific spacing pattern. Sequence alignment suggests that Cupip-PTTH is 23% identical to <span class="yellow">Drosophila melanogaster</span> PTTH, but is >=59% identical to the PTTHs of other mosquitoes. Cupip-PTTH has structural characteristics similar to those of <span class="yellow">Bombyx mori</span> PTTH and some vertebrate nerve growth factors with cysteine-knot motifs. PTTH transcripts exhibit a daily cycling profile during the final (fourth) larval instar, with peak abundance occurring late in the scotophase. The fourth-larval instar stage is one day longer in short-day larvae than in long-day larvae, resulting in larger larvae and adults. This additional day of larval development is associated with one extra PTTH cycle. No cycling was observed in pupae, but PTTH transcripts were slightly higher in short-day pupae than in long-day pupae throughout much of the pupal stage. PTTH expression persisted at a nearly constant level in diapausing adult females for the first month but then dropped by -50%, while expression decreased at the beginning of adulthood in nondiapausing females and then remained at a low level as long as the females were denied a blood meal. However, when nondiapausing females were offered a blood meal, PTTH transcripts rose approximately 7 fold in 2 h and remained elevated for 24 h. <span class="red">A</span> few diapausing females (-10%) will take a blood meal when placed in close proximity to a host, but much of the blood is ejected and such meals do not result in mature eggs. Yet, elevated PTTH mRNA expression was also observed in diapausing females that were force fed. Our results thus point to several distinctions in PTTH expression between short-day and long-day mosquitoes, but both types of females responded to a blood meal by elevating levels of PTTH mRNA. 
<h3>21131485</h3>Regulation of nleA in Shiga toxin-producing <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli O84:H4 strain 4795/97</span>. <br><br>Many Shiga toxin-producing <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span> (<span class="yellow">STEC</span>) strains express a type III secretion system (TTSS) encoded by the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE). Using the TTSS, <span class="yellow">STEC</span> is able to inject effector proteins directly into eukaryotic host cells, where they cause characteristic attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions. In addition to the LEE-encoded effectors, a number of non-LEE-encoded effectors, located on phage-associated elements, have been described. One of them, the non-LEE-encoded effector <span class="red">A</span> (NleA), is widely distributed among pathogenic <span class="yellow">E. coli</span>. In this study, we investigated the influence of environmental conditions on the expression of the phage-encoded effector nleA gene (designated nleA(4795)) present in <span class="yellow">STEC O84:H4 strain 4795/97</span>. We demonstrated that a particular NaCl concentration and starvation stress increase the activity of the nleA(4795) promoter. Moreover, several regulators that control nleA(4795) expression were identified. The involvement of the LEE regulators Ler, GrlA, and GrlR show that nleA(4795) is integrated in the LEE regulation circuit. Furthermore, the binding of Ler to sequences upstream of nleA(4795) underlined these findings. 
<h3>21131488</h3><span class="yellow">Bacillus anthracis</span> sin locus and regulation of secreted proteases.<br><br><span class="yellow">Bacillus anthracis</span> shares many regulatory loci with the nonpathogenic Bacillus species <span class="yellow">Bacillus subtilis</span>. One such locus is sinIR, which in <span class="yellow">B. subtilis</span> controls sporulation, biofilm formation, motility, and competency. As <span class="yellow">B. anthracis</span> is not known to be motile, to be naturally competent, or to readily form biofilms, we hypothesized that the <span class="yellow">B. anthracis</span> sinIR regulon is distinct from that of <span class="yellow">B. subtilis</span>. <span class="red">A</span> genome-wide expression microarray analysis of <span class="yellow">B. anthracis</span> parental and sinR mutant strains indicated limited convergence of the <span class="yellow">B. anthracis</span> and <span class="yellow">B. subtilis</span> SinR regulons. The <span class="yellow">B. anthracis</span> regulon includes homologues of some <span class="yellow">B. subtilis</span> SinR-regulated genes, including the signal peptidase gene sipW near the sinIR locus and the sporulation gene spoIIE. The <span class="yellow">B. anthracis</span> SinR protein also negatively regulates transcription of genes adjacent to the sinIR locus that are unique to the <span class="yellow">Bacillus cereus group species</span>. These include calY and inhA1, structural genes for the metalloproteases camelysin and immune inhibitor A1 (InhA1), which have been suggested to be associated with virulence in <span class="yellow">B. cereus</span> and <span class="yellow">B. anthracis</span>, respectively. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed direct binding of <span class="yellow">B. anthracis</span> SinR to promoter DNA from strongly regulated genes, such as calY and sipW, but not to the weakly regulated inhA1 gene. Assessment of camelysin and InhA1 levels in culture supernates from sinR-, inhA1-, and calY-null mutants showed that the concentration of InhA1 in the culture supernatant is inversely proportional to the concentration of camelysin. Our data are consistent with a model in which InhA1 protease levels are controlled at the transcriptional level by SinR and at the posttranslational level by camelysin. 
<h3>21131497</h3><span class="yellow">Flavobacterium johnsoniae</span> sprB is part of an operon spanning the additional gliding motility genes sprC, sprD, and sprF. <br><br>Cells of <span class="yellow">Flavobacterium johnsoniae</span> move rapidly over surfaces by a process known as gliding motility. Gld proteins are thought to comprise the gliding motor that propels cell surface adhesins, such as the 669-kDa SprB. <span class="red">A</span> novel protein secretion apparatus called the Por secretion system (PorSS) is required for assembly of SprB on the cell surface. Genetic and molecular analyses revealed that sprB is part of a seven-gene operon spanning 29.3 kbp of DNA. In addition to sprB, three other genes of this operon (sprC, sprD, and sprF) are involved in gliding. Mutations in sprB, sprC, sprD, and sprF resulted in cells that failed to form spreading colonies on agar but that exhibited some motility on glass in wet mounts. SprF exhibits some similarity to <span class="yellow">Porphyromonas gingivalis</span> PorP, which is required for secretion of gingipain protease virulence factors via the <span class="yellow">P. gingivalis</span> PorSS. <span class="yellow">F. johnsoniae</span> sprF mutants produced SprB protein but were defective in localization of SprB to the cell surface, suggesting a role for SprF in secretion of SprB. The <span class="yellow">F. johnsoniae</span> PorSS is involved in secretion of extracellular chitinase in addition to its role in secretion of SprB. SprF was not needed for chitinase secretion and may be specifically required for SprB secretion by the PorSS. Cells with nonpolar mutations in sprC or sprD produced and secreted SprB and propelled it rapidly along the cell surface. Multiple paralogs of sprB, sprC, sprD, and sprF are present in the genome, which may explain why mutations in sprB, sprC, sprD, and sprF do not result in complete loss of motility and suggests the possibility that semiredundant SprB-like adhesins may allow movement of cells over different surfaces. 
<h3>21147038</h3>Disrupted energy metabolism and neuronal circuit dysfunction in cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. <br><br>Epidemiological, neuropathological, and functional neuroimaging evidence implicates global and regional disruptions in brain metabolism and energetics in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment. Nerve cell microcircuits are modified by excitatory and inhibitory synaptic activity and neurotrophic factors. Ageing and Alzheimer's disease cause perturbations in cellular energy metabolism, level of excitation or inhibition, and neurotrophic factor release, which overwhelm compensatory mechanisms and result in dysfunction of neuronal microcircuits and brain networks. <span class="red">A</span> prolonged positive energy balance impairs the ability of neurons to adapt to oxidative and metabolic stress. Results from experimental studies in animals show how disruptions caused by chronic positive energy balance, such as diabetes, lead to accelerated cognitive ageing and Alzheimer's disease. Therapeutic interventions to allay cognitive dysfunction that target energy metabolism and adaptive stress responses (such as neurotrophin signalling) have been effective in animal models and in preliminary studies in <span class="yellow">humans</span>. 
<h3>21147039</h3>Behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia: diagnosis, clinical staging, and management. <br><br>Patients with behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) present with insidious changes in personality and interpersonal conduct that indicate progressive disintegration of the neural circuits involved in social cognition, emotion regulation, motivation, and decision making. The underlying pathological changes are heterogeneous and are characterised by various intraneuronal inclusions. Biomarkers to detect these histopathological changes in life are becoming increasingly important with the development of disease-modifying drugs. Gene mutations have been found that collectively account for around 10-20% of cases. Recently, criteria proposed for bvFTD define three levels of diagnostic certainty: possible, probable, and definite. Detailed history taking from family members to elicit behavioural features underpins the diagnostic process, with support from neuropsychological testing designed to detect impairment in decision making, emotion processing, and social cognition. Brain imaging is important for increasing the level of diagnostic certainty. <span class="red">A</span> recently developed staging instrument shows much promise for monitoring patients and evaluating therapies, which at present are aimed at symptom amelioration. Carer education and support remain of paramount importance. 
<h3>21148727</h3>A transcriptional regulator and ABC transporters link stress tolerance, (p)ppGpp, and genetic competence in Streptococcus mutans. <br><br>Streptococcus mutans, a primary agent of dental caries, has three (p)ppGpp synthases: RelA, which is required for a mupirocin-induced stringent response; RelP, which produces (p)ppGpp during exponential growth and is regulated by the RelRS two-component system; and RelQ. Transcription of relPRS and a gene cluster (SMu0835 to SMu0837) located immediately upstream was activated in cells grown with aeration and during a stringent response, respectively. Bioinformatic analysis predicted that SMu0836 and SMu0837 encode ABC exporters, which we designated rcrPQ (rel competence-related) genes, respectively. SMu0835 (rcrR) encodes a MarR family transcriptional regulator. Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that RcrR functions as an autogenous negative regulator of the expression of the rcrRPQ operon. <span class="red">A</span> mutant in which a polar insertion replaced the SMu836 gene (Delta836polar) grew more slowly and had final yields that were lower than those of the wild-type strain. Likewise, the Delta836polar strain had an impaired capacity to form biofilms, grew poorly at pH 5.5, and was more sensitive to oxidative stressors. Optimal expression of rcrPQ required RelP and vice versa. Replacement of rcrR with a nonpolar antibiotic resistance marker (Delta835np), which leads to overexpression of rcrPQ, yielded a strain that was not transformable with exogenous DNA. Transcriptional analysis revealed that the expression of comYA and comX was dramatically altered in the Delta835np and Delta836polar mutants. Collectively, the data support the suggestion that the rcrRPQ gene products play a critical role in physiologic homeostasis and stress tolerance by linking (p)ppGpp metabolism, acid and oxidative stress tolerance, and genetic competence. 
<h3>21169482</h3>Identification of missing genes and enzymes for autotrophic carbon fixation in crenarchaeota. <br><br>Two autotrophic carbon fixation cycles have been identified in Crenarchaeota. The dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle functions in anaerobic or microaerobic autotrophic members of the Thermoproteales and Desulfurococcales. The 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle occurs in aerobic autotrophic Sulfolobales; a similar cycle may operate in autotrophic aerobic marine Crenarchaeota. Both cycles form succinyl-coenzyme <span class="red">A</span> (CoA) from acetyl-CoA and two molecules of inorganic carbon, but they use different means. Both cycles have in common the (re)generation of acetyl-CoA from succinyl-CoA via identical intermediates. Here, we identified several missing enzymes/genes involved in the seven-step conversion of succinyl-CoA to two molecules of acetyl-CoA in <span class="yellow">Thermoproteus neutrophilus</span> (Thermoproteales), <span class="yellow">Ignicoccus hospitalis</span> (Desulfurococcales), and <span class="yellow">Metallosphaera sedula</span> (Sulfolobales). The identified enzymes/genes include succinyl-CoA reductase, succinic semialdehyde reductase, 4-hydroxybutyrate-CoA ligase, bifunctional crotonyl-CoA hydratase/(S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, and beta-ketothiolase. 4-Hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase, which catalyzes a mechanistically intriguing elimination of water, is well conserved and rightly can be considered the key enzyme of these two cycles. In contrast, several of the other enzymes evolved from quite different sources, making functional predictions based solely on genome interpretation difficult, if not questionable. 
<h3>21169486</h3>Labeling and enzyme studies of the central carbon metabolism in <span class="yellow">Metallosphaera sedula</span>. <br><br><span class="yellow">Metallosphaera sedula</span> (Sulfolobales, Crenarchaeota) uses the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle for autotrophic carbon fixation. In this pathway, acetyl-coenzyme <span class="red">A</span> (CoA) and succinyl-CoA are the only intermediates that can be considered common to the central carbon metabolism. We addressed the question of which intermediate of the cycle most biosynthetic routes branch off. We labeled autotrophically growing cells by using 4-hydroxy[1-^1^4C]butyrate and [1,4-^1^3C1]succinate, respectively, as precursors for biosynthesis. The labeling patterns of protein-derived amino acids verified the operation of the proposed carbon fixation cycle, in which 4-hydroxybutyrate is converted to two molecules of acetyl-CoA. The results also showed that major biosynthetic flux does not occur via acetyl-CoA, except for the formation of building blocks that are directly derived from acetyl-CoA. Notably, acetyl-CoA is not assimilated via reductive carboxylation to pyruvate. Rather, our data suggest that the majority of anabolic precursors are derived from succinyl-CoA, which is removed from the cycle via oxidation to malate and oxaloacetate. These C4intermediates yield pyruvate and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). Enzyme activities that are required for forming intermediates from succinyl-CoA were detected, including enzymes catalyzing gluconeogenesis from PEP. This study completes the picture of the central carbon metabolism in autotrophic Sulfolobales by connecting the autotrophic carbon fixation cycle to the formation of central carbon precursor metabolites. 
<h3>21182520</h3>Developmental plasticity of immune defence in two life-history ecotypes of the <span class="yellow">garter snake</span>, <span class="yellow">Thamnophis elegans</span> - a common-environment experiment. <br><br>1. Ecoimmunological theory predicts a link between life-history and immune-defence strategies such that fast-living organisms should rely more on constitutive innate defences compared to slow-living organisms. An untested assumption of this hypothesis is that the variation in immune defence associated with variation in life history has a genetic basis. 2. Replicate populations of two life-history ecotypes of the <span class="yellow">garter snake</span> <span class="yellow">Thamnophis elegans</span> provide an ideal system in which to test this assumption. Free-ranging snakes of the fast-living ecotype, which reside in lakeshore habitats, show higher levels of three measures of constitutive innate immunity than those of the slow-living ecotype, which inhabit meadows around the lake. Although this pattern is consistent with the ecoimmunological pace-of-life hypothesis, environmental differences between the lakeshore and meadow habitats could also explain the observed differences in immune defence. 3. We performed a common-environment experiment to distinguish between these alternatives. Snakes born and raised in common-environment conditions reflected the immune phenotype of their native habitats when sampled at 4 months of age (i.e. fast-living lakeshore snakes showed higher levels of natural antibodies, complement activity and bactericidal competence than slow-living meadow snakes), but no longer showed differences when 19 months old. 4. This suggests that the differences in innate immunity observed between the two ecotypes have an important - and likely age-specific - environmental influence, with these immune components showing developmental plasticity. <span class="red">A</span> genetic effect in early life may also be present, but further research is needed to confirm this possibility and therefore provide a more definitive test of the ecoimmunological pace-of-life hypothesis in this system. 
<h3>21184840</h3>Functional analysis of the fungal/plant class chitinase family in <span class="yellow">Aspergillus fumigatus</span>. <br><br>A quintuple mutant was constructed to delete the entire family of the fungal/plant (class III) chitinases of <span class="yellow">Aspergillus fumigatus</span>. Only a limited reduction in the total chitinolytic activity was seen for the different chitinase mutants including the quintuple mutant. In spite of this reduction in chitinolytic activity, no growth or germination defects were observed in these chitinase mutants. This result demonstrated that the fungal/plant chitinases do not have an essential role in the morphogenesis of <span class="yellow">A. fumigatus</span>. <span class="red">A</span> slight diminution of the growth during autolysis was seen for the quintuple mutant suggesting that class III chitinases may play only a nutritional role during this phase of the cycle, retarding <span class="yellow">fungal</span> death. 
<h3>21185234</h3>Early-onset versus late-onset Alzheimer's disease: the case of the missing APOE epsilo4 allele. <br><br>Some patients with early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) present with a distinct phenotype. Typically, the first and most salient characteristic of AD is episodic memory impairment. <span class="red">A</span> few patients, however, present with focal cortical, non-memory symptoms, such as difficulties with language, visuospatial, or executive functions. These presentations are associated with specific patterns of atrophy and frequently with a young age at onset. Age is not, however, the only determinant of phenotype; underlying factors, especially genetic factors, seem also to affect phenotype and predispose patients to younger or older age at onset. Importantly, patients with atypical early-onset disease seldom carry the APOE epsilo4 allele, which is the most important risk factor for lowering the age of onset in patients with AD. Additionally, theAPOE epsilo4 genotype seems to predispose patients to vulnerability in the medial temporal areas, which leads to memory loss. Conversely, patients negative for the APOE epsilo4 allele and with early-onset AD are more likely to be predisposed to vulnerability of cerebral networks beyond the medial temporal lobes. Other factors are probably involved in determining the pattern of atrophy, but these are currently unknown. 
<h3>21188839</h3>Breathing some air into the single-species vacuum: multi-species responses to environmental change. <br><br>Studies of ecological responses to climate change have often analysed species independently of each other, yet interactions between species are fundamental aspects of ecology. Mutshinda, O'Hara &amp; Woiwod (2011) used light-trapping data for Lepidoptera (moths) to examine population responses to intraspecific effects and effects of winter rainfall and temperature. They show how Bayesian hierarchical models can analyse residual correlations among species' responses, illustrating an approach to account for and measure dependencies that are not fully explained by the candidate explanatory variables. <span class="red">A</span> key result is that the responses of the different moth species did not appear to have strong residual correlation (Mutshinda, O'Hara &amp; Woiwod 2011). These analyses provide an approach for synthesising across species and can better inform ecological responses to environmental change. 
<h3>21227499</h3><span class="yellow">Human</span> resources for health in India.<br><br>India has a severe shortage of <span class="yellow">human</span> resources for health. It has a shortage of qualified health workers and the workforce is concentrated in urban areas. Bringing qualified health workers to rural, remote, and underserved areas is very challenging. Many Indians, especially those living in rural areas, receive care from unqualified providers. The migration of qualified allopathic doctors and nurses is substantial and further strains the system. Nurses do not have much authority or say within the health system, and the resources to train them are still inadequate. Little attention is paid during medical education to the medical and public health needs of the population, and the rapid privatisation of medical and nursing education has implications for its quality and governance. Such issues are a result of underinvestment in and poor governance of the health sector--two issues that the government urgently needs to address. <span class="red">A</span> comprehensive national policy for <span class="yellow">human</span> resources is needed to achieve universal health care in India. The public sector will need to redesign appropriate packages of monetary and non-monetary incentives to encourage qualified health workers to work in rural and remote areas. Such a policy might also encourage task-shifting and mainstreaming doctors and practitioners who practice traditional Indian medicine (ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy, unani, and siddha) and homoeopathy to work in these areas while adopting other innovative ways of augmenting <span class="yellow">human</span> resources for health. At the same time, additional investments will be needed to improve the relevance, quantity, and quality of nursing, medical, and public health education in the country. 
<h3>21241326</h3>Gene expression analysis of wounding-induced root-to-shoot communication in <span class="yellow">Arabidopsis thaliana</span>. <br><br>Root-to-shoot communication plays an important role in the adaptation to environmental stress. In this study, we established a model system for root-to-shoot signalling to observe global gene expression in <span class="yellow">Arabidopsis thaliana</span>. The roots of <span class="yellow">Arabidopsis</span> seedlings were wounded and the expression in the shoots of 68 and 5 genes was up-regulated threefold at 30 min and 6 h post-injury, respectively. These genes were designated early and late Root-to-Shoot responsive (RtS) genes, respectively. Many of the early RtS genes were found to encode transcription factors such as AtERFs, whereas others were associated with jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET). Some of the late RtS genes were shown to be regulated by 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA). In fact, elevated levels of JA and OPDA were detected in the shoots of seedlings 30 min and 6 h, respectively, after wounding of the roots. <span class="red">A</span> mutant analysis revealed that JA and ET are involved in the expression of the early RtS genes. Thus, root-to-shoot communication for many RtS genes is associated with the systemic production of JA, OPDA and possibly ET. 
<h3>21256454</h3>Treatment of patients with essential tremor.<br><br>Essential tremor is a common movement disorder. Tremor severity and handicap vary widely, but most patients with essential tremor do not receive a diagnosis and hence are never treated. Furthermore, many patients abandon treatment because of side-effects or poor efficacy. <span class="red">A</span> newly developed algorithm, based on the logarithmic relation between tremor amplitude and clinical tremor ratings, can be used to compare the magnitude of effect of available treatments. Drugs with established efficacy (propranolol and primidone) produce a mean tremor reduction of about 50%. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the thalamic nucleus ventrointermedius or neighbouring subthalamic structures reduces tremor by about 90%. However, no controlled trials of DBS have been done, and the best target is still uncertain. Better drugs are needed, and controlled trials are required to determine the safety and efficacy of DBS in the nucleus ventrointermedius and neighbouring subthalamic structures. 
<h3>21269301</h3>Pterin-based ornamental coloration predicts yolk antioxidant levels in female <span class="yellow">striped plateau lizards</span> (<span class="yellow">Sceloporus virgatus</span>). <br><br>1. Maternal investment in egg quality can have important consequences for offspring fitness. For example, yolk antioxidants can affect embryonic development as well as juvenile and adult phenotype. Thus, females may be selected to advertise their yolk antioxidant deposition to discriminatory males via ornamental signals, perhaps depending on the reproductive costs associated with signal production. 2. Female <span class="yellow">striped plateau lizards</span> (<span class="yellow">Sceloporus virgatus</span>) develop pterin-based orange colour patches during the reproductive season that influence male behaviour and that are positively associated with the phenotypic quality of the female and her offspring. Here, we assessed one potential developmental mechanism underlying the relationship between offspring quality and female ornamentation in <span class="yellow">S. virgatus</span>, by examining the relationship between ornament expression and yolk antioxidant levels. 3. As expected, concentrations of the yolk antioxidants vitamin <span class="red">A</span>, vitamin E and carotenoids (lutein and zeaxanthin) were strongly positively intercorrelated. Eggs from larger clutches had fewer antioxidants than eggs from smaller clutches, suggesting that females may be limited in antioxidant availability or use. Fertilized and unfertilized eggs did not differ in yolk antioxidant levels. 4. The size of a female's ornament was positively related to both the concentration and total amount of yolk antioxidants, and ornament colour was positively related to yolk antioxidant concentration. Thus, in <span class="yellow">S. virgatus</span>, female ornaments may advertise egg quality. In addition, these data suggest that more ornamented females may produce higher-quality offspring, in part because their eggs contain more antioxidants. As the colour ornament of interest is derived from pterins, not carotenoids, direct resource trade-offs between ornaments and eggs may be eliminated, reducing reproductive costs associated with signalling. 5. This is the first example of a positive relationship between female ornamentation and yolk antioxidants in reptiles and may indicate the general importance of these patterns in oviparous vertebrates. 
<h3>21269674</h3><span class="yellow">Human</span> resources for health in southeast Asia: shortages, distributional challenges, and international trade in health services. <br><br>In this paper, we address the issues of shortage and maldistribution of health personnel in southeast Asia in the context of the international trade in health services. Although there is no shortage of health workers in the region overall, when analysed separately, five low-income countries have some deficit. All countries in southeast Asia face problems of maldistribution of health workers, and rural areas are often understaffed. Despite a high capacity for medical and nursing training in both public and private facilities, there is weak coordination between production of health workers and capacity for employment. Regional experiences and policy responses to address these challenges can be used to inform future policy in the region and elsewhere. <span class="red">A</span> distinctive feature of southeast Asia is its engagement in international trade in health services. Singapore and Malaysia import health workers to meet domestic demand and to provide services to international patients. Thailand attracts many foreign patients for health services. This situation has resulted in the so-called brain drain of highly specialised staff from public medical schools to the private hospitals. The Philippines and Indonesia are the main exporters of doctors and nurses in the region. Agreements about mutual recognition of professional qualifications for three groups of health workers under the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Framework Agreement on Services could result in increased movement within the region in the future. To ensure that vital <span class="yellow">human</span> resources for health are available to meet the needs of the populations that they serve, migration management and retention strategies need to be integrated into ongoing efforts to strengthen health systems in southeast Asia. There is also a need for improved dialogue between the health and trade sectors on how to balance economic opportunities associated with trade in health services with domestic health needs and equity issues. 
<h3>21269678</h3>Emerging infectious diseases in southeast Asia: regional challenges to control.<br><br>Southeast Asia is a hotspot for emerging infectious diseases, including those with pandemic potential. Emerging infectious diseases have exacted heavy public health and economic tolls. Severe acute respiratory syndrome rapidly decimated the region's tourist industry. Influenza <span class="red">A</span> <span class="yellow">H5N1</span> has had a profound effect on the <span class="yellow">poultry</span> industry. The reasons why southeast Asia is at risk from emerging infectious diseases are complex. The region is home to dynamic systems in which biological, social, ecological, and technological processes interconnect in ways that enable microbes to exploit new ecological niches. These processes include population growth and movement, urbanisation, changes in food production, agriculture and land use, water and sanitation, and the effect of health systems through generation of drug resistance. Southeast Asia is home to about 600 million people residing in countries as diverse as Singapore, a city state with a gross domestic product (GDP) of US$37,500 per head, and Laos, until recently an overwhelmingly rural economy, with a GDP of US$890 per head. The regional challenges in control of emerging infectious diseases are formidable and range from influencing the factors that drive disease emergence, to making surveillance systems fit for purpose, and ensuring that regional governance mechanisms work effectively to improve control interventions. 
<h3>21276719</h3>Protist-like inclusions in amber, as evidenced by Charentes amber.<br><br>The mid-Cretaceous amber of France contains thousands of protist-like inclusions similar in shape to some ciliates, flagellates and amoebae. The sheer abundance of these inclusions and their size variation within a single amber piece are not concordant with true fossil protists. French amber is coniferous in origin, which generally does not preserve well protists without cell walls. Thus, it would be surprising if French Cretaceous amber had preserved millions of protists. Here, we present a survey of the protist-like inclusions from French amber and attempt to elucidate their origins. Diverse Cretaceous ambers (from Spain, Germany and Lebanon), also derived from conifer resins, contain thousands of protist-like inclusions. In contrast, Tertiary ambers and modern resins are poor in protist-like fossils. This suggests these inclusions originated from early Cretaceous plant resins, probably secreted with the resin by trees that did not survive after the Cretaceous (such as the Cheirolepidiaceae). <span class="red">A</span> review of the recent literature on amber microfossils indicates several protist-like inclusions that are unlikely to have a biological origin have already been described as real fossil protists. This is problematic in that it will bias our understanding of protist evolution. 
<h3>21282046</h3>Polymorphism of <span class="yellow">Paramecium pentaurelia</span> (Ciliophora, Oligohymenophorea) strains revealed by rDNA and mtDNA sequences. <br><br><span class="yellow">Paramecium pentaurelia</span> is one of 15 known sibling species of the Paramecium aurelia complex. It is recognized as a species showing no intra-specific differentiation on the basis of molecular fingerprint analyses, whereas the majority of other species are polymorphic. This study aimed at assessing genetic polymorphism within <span class="yellow">P. pentaurelia</span> including new strains recently found in Poland (originating from two water bodies, different years, seasons, and clones of one strain) as well as strains collected from distant habitats (USA, Europe, Asia), and strains representing other species of the complex. We compared two DNA fragments: partial sequences (349 bp) of the LSU rDNA and partial sequences (618 bp) of cytochrome B gene. <span class="red">A</span> correlation between the geographical origin of the strains and the genetic characteristics of their genotypes was not observed. Different genotypes were found in Kraksigmaw in two types of water bodies (Opatkowice-natural pond; Jordan's Park-artificial pond). Haplotype diversity within a single water body was not recorded. Likewise, seasonal haplotype differences between the strains within the artificial water body, as well as differences between clones originating from one strain, were not detected. The clustering of some strains belonging to different species was observed in the phylogenies. 
<h3>21284624</h3>Determinants of reproductive success in dominant pairs of clownfish: a boosted regression tree analysis. <br><br>1. Central questions of behavioural and evolutionary ecology are what factors influence the reproductive success of dominant breeders and subordinate nonbreeders within animal societies? <span class="red">A</span> complete understanding of any society requires that these questions be answered for all individuals. 2. The clown anemonefish, <span class="yellow">Amphiprion percula</span>, forms simple societies that live in close association with sea anemones, <span class="yellow">Heteractis magnifica</span>. Here, we use data from a well-studied population of <span class="yellow">A. percula</span> to determine the major predictors of reproductive success of dominant pairs in this species. 3. We analyse the effect of multiple predictors on four components of reproductive success, using a relatively new technique from the field of statistical learning: boosted regression trees (BRTs). BRTs have the potential to model complex relationships in ways that give powerful insight. 4. We show that the reproductive success of dominant pairs is unrelated to the presence, number or phenotype of nonbreeders. This is consistent with the observation that nonbreeders do not help or hinder breeders in any way, confirming and extending the results of a previous study. 5. Primarily, reproductive success is negatively related to male growth and positively related to breeding experience. It is likely that these effects are interrelated because males that grow a lot have little breeding experience. These effects are indicative of a trade-off between male growth and parental investment. 6. Secondarily, reproductive success is positively related to female growth and size. In this population, female size is positively related to group size and anemone size, also. These positive correlations among traits likely are caused by variation in site quality and are suggestive of a silver-spoon effect. 7. Noteworthily, whereas reproductive success is positively related to female size, it is unrelated to male size. This observation provides support for the size advantage hypothesis for sex change: both individuals maximize their reproductive success when the larger individual adopts the female tactic. 8. This study provides the most complete picture to date of the factors that predict the reproductive success of dominant pairs of clown anemonefish and illustrates the utility of BRTs for analysis of complex behavioural and evolutionary ecology data. 
<h3>21333593</h3>Comparative immunofluorescence and ultrastructural analysis of microtubule organization in Uronema sp., <span class="yellow">Klebsormidium flaccidum</span>, <span class="yellow">K. subtilissimum</span>, <span class="yellow">Stichococcus bacillaris</span> and <span class="yellow">S. chloranthus</span> (Chlorophyta). <br><br>A detailed comparative examination of microtubule (MT) organization in interphase and dividing cells of Uronema sp., <span class="yellow">Klebsormidium flaccidum</span>, <span class="yellow">K. subtilissimum</span>, <span class="yellow">Stichococcus bacillaris</span> and <span class="yellow">S. chloranthus</span> was made using tubulin immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). During interphase all the species bear a well-organized cortical MT system, consisting of parallel bundles with different orientations. In Uronema sp. the cortical MT bundles are longitudinally oriented, whereas in the other species they are in transverse orientation to the axis of the cells. Considerable differences in MT organization were also observed during stages of mitosis, mainly preprophase, as well as cytokinesis. In Uronema sp., a particular radial MT assembly is organized during preprophase-early prophase, which was not observed in the other species. In Stichococcus a fine MT ring surrounded the nucleus during preprophase and prophase. An MT ring, together with single cytoplasmic MTs, was also found associated with the developing diaphragm during cytokinesis in Stichococcus. <span class="red">A</span> phycoplast participates in cytokinesis in Uronema sp., but not in the other species. In Uronema sp. the centrosome functions as a microtubule organizing center (MTOC) during mitosis, but not during interphase and cytokinesis. The phylogenetic significance of these differences is discussed in combination with SSU/ITS sequencing and other, existing molecular data. 
<h3>21349121</h3>Projectin PEVK domain, splicing variants and domain structure in basal and derived insects. <br><br>The third elastic filament of striated muscles consists of giant proteins: titin (in vertebrates) and kettin/projectin (in insects). In all three proteins, elasticity is at least partly associated with the so-called PEVK domain. The projectin PEVK domains of diverse insects are highly divergent compared with an otherwise conserved protein organization. We present the characterization of the PEVK domain in two dragonflies and in <span class="yellow">human lice</span>. <span class="red">A</span> conserved segment at the end of the PEVK, the NH(2)-terminal conserved segment-1 (NTCS-1), may serve as an anchor point for projectin to either myosin or actin, providing a mechanical link. The analysis of alternative splicing variants identifies the shortest PEVK isoform as the predominant form in the flight muscles of several insects, possibly contributing to myofibrillar stiffness. 
<h3>21349441</h3>Paediatric stroke: genetic insights into disease mechanisms and treatment targets. <br><br>In children, stroke is as common as brain tumour and causes substantial mortality and long-term morbidity, with recurrence in up to 20%. There are three sets of international clinical guidelines relating to childhood stroke; however, acute and preventive treatment recommendations are based on interventions effective in adults, rather than data regarding efficacy in children. <span class="red">A</span> wide spectrum of risk factors underlies childhood stroke, and these risk factors vary from those encountered in adults. Specific disease mechanisms implicated in childhood arterial ischaemic stroke have received little attention, but an increased understanding of disease pathogenesis could lead to novel targeted treatment approaches. Here, we consider insights into the pathogenesis of childhood arterial ischaemic stroke and cerebral arteriopathy, provided by current knowledge of Mendelian diseases that are associated with an increased risk of these conditions. We give particular attention to aspects of vascular development, homoeostasis, and response to environmental effects. Our analysis highlights a potential role for interventions already licensed for pharmaceutical use, as well as new therapeutic targets and avenues for further research. 
<h3>21371658</h3>Guidelines for hospital-acquired pneumonia and health-care-associated pneumonia: a vulnerability, a pitfall, and a fatal flaw. <br><br>The 2005 American Thoracic Society and Infectious Disease Society of America's guidelines for pneumonia introduced the new category of health-care-associated pneumonia, which increased the number of people to whom the guidelines for multidrug-resistant pathogens applied. Three fundamental issues inherent in the definition of hospital-acquired pneumonia and health-care-associated pneumonia undermined the credibility of these guidelines and the applicability of their recommendations: a vulnerability, a pitfall, and a fatal flaw. The vulnerability is the extreme heterogeneity of the population of patients. The fatal flaw is the failure to accurately diagnose hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia; inability to distinguish colonisation from infection in respiratory-tract cultures renders the guidelines inherently unstable. The pitfall is spiralling empiricism of antibiotic use for severely ill patients in whom infection might not be present. <span class="red">A</span> vicious circle of antibiotic overuse leading to emergence of resistant microflora can become established, leading to unnecessary use of empirical broad-spectrum combination antibiotics and increased mortality. Controlled studies now show that administration of broad-spectrum combination antibiotic therapy can lead to increased mortality in uninfected patients. Proposed solutions include the use of individualised assessment of patients. Health-care-associated pneumonia should be broken down into several distinct subgroups so narrow-spectrum antibiotic therapy can be used. Emphasis should be placed on defining the microbial cause of the pneumonia rather than reflex administration of empirical combination therapy. 
<h3>21376670</h3>Towards a conceptual framework to support one-health research for policy on emerging zoonoses. <br><br>In the past two decades there has been a growing realisation that the livestock sector was in a process of change, resulting from an expansion of intensive animal production systems and trade to meet a globalised world's increasing demand for livestock products. One unintended consequence has been the emergence and spread of transboundary animal diseases and, more specifically, the resurgence and emergence of zoonotic diseases. Concurrent with changes in the livestock sector, contact with wildlife has increased. This development has increased the risk of transmission of infections from wildlife to <span class="yellow">human</span> beings and livestock. Two overarching questions arise with respect to the real and perceived threat from emerging infectious diseases: why are these problems arising with increasing frequency, and how should we manage and control them? <span class="red">A</span> clear conceptual research framework can provide a guide to ensure a research strategy that coherently links to the overarching goals of policy makers. We propose such a new framework in support of a research and policy-generation strategy to help to address the challenges posed by emerging zoonoses. 
<h3>21426342</h3>Introduced <span class="yellow">brown trout</span> alter native acanthocephalan infections in native fish.<br><br>1. Native parasite acquisition provides introduced species with the potential to modify native host-parasite dynamics by acting as parasite reservoirs (with the 'spillback' of infection increasing the parasite burdens of native hosts) or sinks (with the 'dilution' of infection decreasing the parasite burdens of native hosts) of infection. 2. In New Zealand, negative correlations between the presence of introduced <span class="yellow">brown trout</span> (<span class="yellow">Salmo trutta</span>) and native parasite burdens of the native <span class="yellow">roundhead galaxias</span> (<span class="yellow">Galaxias anomalus</span>) have been observed, suggesting that parasite dilution is occurring. 3. We used a multiple-scale approach combining field observations, experimental infections and dynamic population modelling to investigate whether native Acanthocephalus galaxii acquisition by <span class="yellow">brown trout</span> alters host-parasite dynamics in native <span class="yellow">roundhead galaxias</span>. 4. Field observations demonstrated higher infection intensity in introduced <span class="yellow">trout</span> than in <span class="yellow">native galaxias</span>, but only small, immature <span class="red">A</span>. galaxii were present in <span class="yellow">trout</span>. Experimental infections also demonstrated that <span class="red">A</span>. galaxii does not mature in <span class="yellow">trout</span>, although parasite establishment and initial growth were similar in the two hosts. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that <span class="yellow">trout</span> may serve as an infection sink for the native parasite. 5. However, dynamic population modelling predicts that <span class="red">A</span>. galaxii infections in <span class="yellow">native galaxias</span><span class="yellow">galaxias</span> should at most only be slightly reduced by dilution in the presence of <span class="yellow">trout</span>. Rather, model exploration indicates parasite densities in <span class="yellow">galaxias</span> are highly sensitive to <span class="yellow">galaxias</span> predation on infected amphipods, and to relative abundances of <span class="yellow">galaxias</span> and <span class="yellow">trout</span>. Hence, <span class="yellow">trout</span> presence may instead reduce parasite burdens in <span class="yellow">galaxias</span> by either reducing <span class="yellow">galaxias</span> density or by altering <span class="yellow">galaxias</span> foraging behaviour. 
<h3>21453872</h3>Hygiene: new hopes, new horizons.<br><br>Although promotion of safe hygiene is the single most cost-effective means of preventing infectious disease, investment in hygiene is low both in the health and in the water and sanitation sectors. Evidence shows the benefit of improved hygiene, especially for improved handwashing and safe stool disposal. <span class="red">A</span> growing understanding of what drives hygiene behaviour and creative partnerships are providing fresh approaches to change behaviour. However, some important gaps in our knowledge exist. For example, almost no trials of the effectiveness of interventions to improve food hygiene in developing countries are available. We also need to figure out how best to make safe hygiene practices matters of daily routine that are sustained by social norms on a mass scale. Full and active involvement of the health sector in getting safe hygiene to all homes, schools, and institutions will bring major gains to public health. 
<h3>21466552</h3>An empirical link between the spectral colour of climate and the spectral colour of field populations in the context of climate change. <br><br>1. The spectral colour of population dynamics and its causes have attracted much interest. The spectral colour of a time series can be determined from its power spectrum, which shows what proportion of the total variance in the time series occurs at each frequency. <span class="red">A</span> time series with a red spectrum (a negative spectral exponent) is dominated by low-frequency oscillations, and a time series with a blue spectrum (a positive spectral exponent) is dominated by high-frequency oscillations. 2. Both climate variables and population time series are characterised by red spectra, suggesting that a population's environment might be partly responsible for its spectral colour. Laboratory experiments and models have been used to investigate this potential link. However, no study using field data has directly tested whether populations in redder environments are redder. 3. This study uses the Global Population Dynamics Database together with climate data to test for this effect. We found that the spectral exponent of mean summer temperatures correlates positively and significantly with population spectral exponent. 4. We also found that over the last century, temperature climate variables on most continents have become bluer. 5. Although population time series are not long or abundant enough to judge directly whether their spectral colours are changing, our two results taken together suggest that population spectral colour may be affected by the changing spectral colour of climate variables. Population spectral colour has been linked to extinction; we discuss the potential implications of our results for extinction probability. 
<h3>21477200</h3><span class="yellow">Baculovirus</span> cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyases show a close relationship with lepidopteran host homologues. <br><br>Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) photolyases repair ultraviolet (UV)-induced DNA damage using blue light. To get insight in the origin of <span class="yellow">baculovirus</span> CPD photolyase (phr) genes, homologues in the lepidopteran insects <span class="yellow">Chrysodeixis chalcites</span>, <span class="yellow">Spodoptera exigua</span> and <span class="yellow">Trichoplusia ni</span> were identified and characterized. Lepidopteran and <span class="yellow">baculovirus</span> phr genes each form a monophyletic group, and together form a well-supported clade within the insect photolyases. This suggests that <span class="yellow">baculoviruses</span> obtained their phr genes from an ancestral lepidopteran insect host. <span class="red">A</span> likely evolutionary scenario is that a granulovirus, <span class="yellow">Spodoptera litura GV</span> or a direct ancestor, obtained a phr gene. Subsequently, it was horizontally transferred from this granulovirus to several group II nucleopolyhedroviruses (NPVs), including those that infect noctuids of the Plusiinae subfamily. 
<h3>21488872</h3>Scale and state dependence of the relationship between personality and dispersal in a <span class="yellow">great tit</span> population. <br><br>1. Dispersal is a key process in population biology and ecology. Although the general ecological conditions that lead to dispersal have been well studied, the causes of individual variation in dispersal are less well understood. <span class="red">A</span> number of recent studies suggest that heritable temperament - or personality - traits are correlated with dispersal in the wild but the extent to which these 'personality-dispersal syndromes' are general, how they depend on an individual's state and on spatial scale and whether they are temporally stable, both within and across individuals, remains unclear. 2. Here, we examine the relationship between exploration behaviour - an axis of personality that appears to be important in animals generally - and a variety of dispersal processes over 6 years in a population of the <span class="yellow">great tit</span> <span class="yellow">Parus major</span>. 3. Exploration behaviour was higher in immigrant than in locally born juveniles, but the difference was much larger for individuals with a small body mass, though independent of sex, representing one of the first examples of a state-dependent effect in a personality-dispersal syndrome. 4. Despite a temporal trend in exploration behaviour at the population level, the difference between immigrants and locally born birds remained stable over time, both across and within individuals. This suggests that the personality difference between immigrants and locally born birds is established early in development, but that the process of immigration interacts with both personality and state. 5. We found that the number of immigrant parents a locally born bird had did not influence exploration behaviour, suggesting either the difference between immigrants and residents was environmental or that the effect is overridden by local environmental sources of variation. 6. In contrast to previous work, we found no evidence for links between personality and natal dispersal distance within the population, either in terms of an individual's own exploration behaviour or that of its parents. 7. Our results suggest that there are links between individual differences in personality and dispersal, but that these can be dependent on differences in state among individuals and on the scale over which dispersal is measured. Future work should aim to understand the differences between dispersal within and between populations and the ways in which personality and state interact to determine the outcome of these processes. 
<h3>21496128</h3>Pyrethroid resistance in <span class="yellow">Sitophilus zeamais</span> is associated with a mutation (T929I) in the voltage-gated sodium channel. <br><br>The <span class="yellow">maize weevil</span>, <span class="yellow">Sitophilus zeamais</span>, is the most important pest affecting stored grain in Brazil and its control relies heavily on the use of insecticides. The intensive use of compounds such as the pyrethroids has led to the emergence of resistance, and previous studies have suggested that resistance to both pyrethroids and 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) may result from reduced sensitivity of the insecticide target, the voltage-gated sodium channel. To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying pyrethroid resistance in <span class="yellow">S. zeamais</span>, the domain II region of the voltage-gated sodium channel (para-orthologue) gene was amplified by PCR and sequenced from susceptible and resistant laboratory <span class="yellow">S. zeamais</span> strains that were selected with a discriminating dose of DDT. <span class="red">A</span> single point mutation, T929I, was found in the para gene of the resistant <span class="yellow">S. zeamais</span> populations and its presence in individual weevils was strongly associated with survival after DDT exposure. This is the first identification of a target-site resistance mutation in <span class="yellow">S. zeamais</span> and unusually it is a super-kdr type mutation occurring in the absence of the more common kdr (L1014F) substitution. <span class="red">A</span> high-throughput assay based on TaqMan single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping was developed for sensitive detection of the mutation and used to screen field-collected strains of <span class="yellow">S. zeamais</span>. This showed that the mutation is present at low frequency in field populations and is a useful tool for informing control strategies. 
<h3>21496911</h3>Stillbirths: Where? When? Why? How to make the data count?<br><br>Despite increasing attention and investment for maternal, neonatal, and child health, stillbirths remain invisible-not counted in the Millennium Development Goals, nor tracked by the UN, nor in the Global Burden of Disease metrics. At least 2*65 million stillbirths (uncertainty range 2*08 million to 3*79 million) were estimated worldwide in 2008 (>=1000 g birthweight or >=28 weeks of gestation). 98% of stillbirths occur in low-income and middle-income countries, and numbers vary from 2*0 per 1000 total births in Finland to more than 40 per 1000 total births in Nigeria and Pakistan. Worldwide, 67% of stillbirths occur in rural families, 55% in rural sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, where skilled birth attendance and caesarean sections are much lower than that for urban births. In total, an estimated 1*19 million (range 0*82 million to 1*97 million) intrapartum stillbirths occur yearly. Most intrapartum stillbirths are associated with obstetric emergencies, whereas antepartum stillbirths are associated with maternal infections and fetal growth restriction. National estimates of causes of stillbirths are scarce, and multiple (>35) classification systems impede international comparison. Immediate data improvements are feasible through household surveys and facility audit, and improvements in vital registration, including specific perinatal certificates and revised International Classification of Disease codes, are needed. <span class="red">A</span> simple, programme-relevant stillbirth classification that can be used with verbal autopsy would provide a basis for comparable national estimates. <span class="red">A</span> new focus on all deaths around the time of birth is crucial to inform programmatic investment. 
<h3>21514396</h3>Altering sexual reproductive mode by interspecific exchange of MAT loci.<br><br>Sexual fungi can be self-sterile (heterothallic, requiring genetically distinct partners) or self-fertile (homothallic, no partner required). In most ascomycetes, a single mating type locus (MAT) controls the ability to reproduce sexually. In the genus Cochliobolus, all heterothallic species have either MAT1-1 or MAT1-2 (but never both) in different individuals whereas all homothallic species carry both MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 in the same nucleus of an individual. It has been demonstrated, previously, that a MAT gene from homothallic <span class="yellow">Cochliobolus luttrellii</span> can confer self-mating ability on a mat-deleted strain of its heterothallic relative, <span class="yellow">Cochliobolus heterostrophus</span>. In this reciprocal study, we expressed, separately, the heterothallic <span class="yellow">C. heterostrophus</span> MAT1-1-1 and MAT1-2-1 genes in a mat-deleted homothallic <span class="yellow">C. luttrellii</span> strain and asked if this converts homothallic <span class="yellow">C. luttrellii</span> to heterothallism. We report that: (1) <span class="red">A</span> <span class="yellow">C. luttrellii</span> transgenic strain carrying <span class="yellow">C. heterostrophus</span> MAT1-1-1 and a <span class="yellow">C. luttrellii</span> transgenic strain carrying <span class="yellow">C. heterostrophus</span> MAT1-2-1 can mate in a heterothallic manner and the fertility of the cross is similar to that of a wild type <span class="yellow">C. luttrellii</span> self. Full tetrads are always found. (2) <span class="red">A</span> <span class="yellow">C. luttrellii</span> transgenic strain carrying <span class="yellow">C. heterostrophus</span> MAT1-1-1 can mate with the parental wild type <span class="yellow">C. luttrellii</span> MAT1-1;MAT1-2 strain, indicating the latter is able to outcross, a result which was expected but has not been demonstrated previously. (3) <span class="red">A</span> <span class="yellow">C. luttrellii</span> transgenic strain carrying <span class="yellow">C. heterostrophus</span> MAT1-2-1 cannot mate with the parental wild type <span class="yellow">C. luttrellii</span> MAT1-1;MAT1-2 strain, indicating outcrossing specificity. (4) Each transgenic <span class="yellow">C. luttrellii</span> strain, carrying only a single <span class="yellow">C. heterostrophus</span> MAT gene, is able to self, although all pseudothecia produced are smaller than those of wild type and fertility is low (about 4-15% of the number of wild type asci). These data support the argument that in Cochliobolus spp., the primary determinant of reproductive mode is MAT itself, and that a heterothallic strain can be made homothallic or a homothallic strain can be made heterothallic by exchange of MAT genes. The selfing ability of transgenic <span class="yellow">C. luttrellii</span> strains also suggests that both MAT1-1-1 and MAT1-2-1 genes of <span class="yellow">C. heterostrophus</span> carry equivalent transcription regulatory activities, each capable of promoting sexual development when alone, in a suitable genetic background. 
<h3>21521214</h3>Lasting effects of maternal behaviour on the distribution of a dispersive stream insect. <br><br>1. Predicting population dynamics at large spatial scales requires integrating information about spatial distribution patterns, inter-patch movement rates and within-patch processes. Advective dispersal of aquatic species by water movement is considered paramount to understanding their population dynamics. Rivers are model advective systems, and the larvae of baetid mayflies are considered quintessential dispersers. Egg laying of baetids along channels is patchy and reflects the distribution of oviposition sites, but larvae are assumed to drift frequently and far, thereby erasing patterns created during oviposition. Dispersal kernels are often overestimated, however, and empirical tests of such assumptions are warranted because of the pivotal role distribution patterns can have on populations. 2. We tested empirically whether the egg distribution patterns arising from oviposition behaviours persisted and were reflected in the distribution patterns of larval <span class="yellow">Baetis rhodani</span>. In field surveys, we tested for associations between egg mass and larval densities over 1 km lengths of four streams. <span class="red">A</span> control species, the mayfly Ephemerella ignita, was employed to test for covarying environmental factors. We estimated drift rates directly to test whether larvae dispersed between riffles (patches of high egg mass density) and whether drift rates were density-dependent or density-related - expected outcomes if drift erases patterns established by maternal behaviours. 3. Positive associations between egg masses and larval benthic densities were found for neonate and mid-stage larvae of Baetis, but not the control species, suggesting persistence of the patchy distribution patterns established at oviposition. Drift rates were high, and riffles were net exporters of neonate and mid-stage larvae, but drift rates were unrelated to benthic densities and few drifters reached the next riffle. Riffles were sinks for large larvae, suggesting ontogenetic shifts in habitat use, but little long-distance dispersal. 4. Overall, the results suggest that most neonate and mid-stage larvae of <span class="yellow">B. rhodani</span> remain close to the natal riffle, and late-stage larvae disperse shorter distances than routinely assumed. The persistence of maternal effects on distribution patterns well into juvenile life of an allegedly iconic disperser suggests that traditional models of how dispersal influences the population dynamics of many lotic invertebrates may be incorrect. 
<h3>21526926</h3>Nesting biology and fungiculture of the fungus-growing ant, Mycetagroicus cerradensis: new light on the origin of higher attine agriculture. <br><br>The genus Mycetagroicus is perhaps the least known of all fungus-growing ant genera, having been first described in 2001 from museum specimens. <span class="red">A</span> recent molecular phylogenetic analysis of the fungus-growing ants demonstrated that Mycetagroicus is the sister to all higher attine ants (Trachymyrmex, Sericomyrmex, Acromyrmex, Pseudoatta, and Atta), making it of extreme importance for understanding the transition between lower and higher attine agriculture. Four nests of Mycetagroicus cerradensis near Uberlandia, Minas Gerais, Brazil were excavated, and fungus chambers for one were located at a depth of 3.5 meters. Based on its lack of gongylidia (hyphal-tip swellings typical of higher attine cultivars), and a phylogenetic analysis of the ITS rDNA gene region, M. cerradensis cultivates a lower attine fungus in Clade 2 of lower attine (G3) fungi. This finding refines a previous estimate for the origin of higher attine agriculture, an event that can now be dated at approximately 21-25 mya in the ancestor of extant species of Trachymyrmex and Sericomyrmex. 
<h3>21565476</h3>Morphological redescriptions of four marine ciliates (Ciliophora: Cyrtophorida: Dysteriidae) from Qingdao, China. <br><br>The morphology and infraciliature of four marine cyrtophorid ciliates isolated from Qingdao, China, were investigated. Based on the present work and on previous data, improved diagnoses for three rarely known species are provided: (1) Mirodysteria decora; small-sized marine Mirodysteria about 35-60 x 25-35 mum in vivo, oval in outline; body surface with two or three conspicuous dorsal spines and one caudal spine; three right kineties, the rightmost one extending dorso-apically; left frontal kineties reduced, each consisting of three basal bodies only; podite subcaudally positioned; two ventrally located contractile vacuoles. (2) Dysteria legumen; body oval with two longitudinal grooves on different plates; six right kineties, the rightmost two of which extend dorso-apically; two left frontal kineties and two ventrally located contractile vacuoles. (3) Dysteria proraefrons; body about 60x35 mum in vivo; six right kineties, the two rightmost of which extend dorso-apically and the leftmost one is considerably shortened; three left frontal kineties; two ventrally located contractile vacuoles. <span class="red">A</span> population of <span class="yellow">D. derouxi</span> with eight or nine right kineties is also briefly described. The current investigation further demonstrates high diversity and cosmopolitan distribution of this highly specialized group of benthic ciliates. 
<h3>21585578</h3>Influence of helix 12 of Ultraspiracle on <span class="yellow">Drosophila melanogaster</span> ecdysone receptor function. <br><br>Although it has no ligand, helix 12 in the ligand binding domain of Ultraspiracle (USP) is locked in an antagonistic position. To investigate whether this position is of functional importance, we enhanced the flexibility of helix 12 by mutating two amino acids (259, located in L1-3 and F491 in helix 12). Mutated USP reduces the stability of USP and all isoforms of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) and impairs nuclear localization and DNA binding of EcR/USP(L259A/F491/A), resulting in lower levels of basal transcriptional activity. Although the affinity of the ligand ponasterone <span class="red">A</span> to EcR/USP(L259/F491) is moderately diminished, hormone-induced stimulation of transcriptional activity is normal. Potentiation of the ecdysone response by juvenile hormone (JH) is selectively increased in mutated heterodimers with EcR-B1, demonstrating that the antagonistic position impairs functional interaction of the EcR complex with JHIII. 
<h3>21820070</h3>Application of the systematic "DAmP" approach to create a partially defective <span class="yellow">C. albicans</span> mutant. <br><br>An understanding of gene function often relies upon creating multiple kinds of alleles. Functional analysis in <span class="yellow">Candida albicans</span>, a major <span class="yellow">fungal</span> pathogen, has generally included characterization of mutant strains with insertion or deletion alleles and over-expression alleles. Here we use in <span class="yellow">C. albicans</span> another type of allele that has been employed effectively in the model <span class="yellow">yeast</span> <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, a "Decreased Abundance by mRNA Perturbation" (DAmP) allele (Yan et al., 2008). DAmP alleles are created systematically through replacement of 30 noncoding regions with nonfunctional heterologous sequences, and thus are broadly applicable. We used a DAmP allele to probe the function of Sun41, a surface protein with roles in cell wall integrity, cell-cell adherence, hyphal formation, and biofilm formation that has been suggested as a possible therapeutic target (Firon et al., 2007; Hiller et al., 2007; Norice et al., 2007). <span class="red">A</span> SUN41-DAmP allele results in approximately 10-fold reduced levels of SUN41 RNA, and yields intermediate phenotypes in most assays. We report that a sun41Delta/Delta mutant is defective in biofilm formation in vivo, and that the SUN41-DAmP allele complements that defect. This finding argues that Sun41 may not be an ideal therapeutic target for biofilm inhibition, since a 90% decrease in activity has little effect on biofilm formation in vivo. We anticipate that DAmP alleles of <span class="yellow">C. albicans</span> genes will be informative for analysis of other prospective drug targets, including essential genes. 
<h3>21840412</h3>Expression and functional characterisation of TNC, a high-affinity nickel transporter from <span class="yellow">Neurospora crassa</span>. <br><br>Our previous in silico studies identified a high-affinity nickel transporter,TNC, from the metal transportome of <span class="yellow">Neurospora crassa</span>. <span class="red">A</span> knockout mutant of the tnc gene in <span class="yellow">N. crassa</span> failed to transport nickel, showed phenotypic growth defects and diminished urease activity under physiological levels of nickel. Transport assays conducted in wild type and knockout mutant strains showed that TNC transports nickel withhigh affinity but exhibits selectivity for other transition metal ions like cobalt. Heterologous complementation of <span class="yellow">Schizosaccharomyces pombe</span> nickel uptake mutant by TNC further substantiates its nickel transport function. Transcriptional analysis of the nickel transporter encoding gene, tnc in <span class="yellow">N. crassa</span> by qRT-PCR showed its constitutive expression in various phases of its life cycle. However, levels of the corresponding protein TNC were down-regulated only by increasing the nickel, but not cobalt concentration in the media. Immunolocalisation data suggested that TNC is distributed in the plasma membrane of <span class="yellow">N. crassa</span>. Thus, the present study establishes TNC as a functional plasma membrane nickel transporter necessary for physiological acquisition of nickel in the multicellular fungi <span class="yellow">N. crassa</span>. 
<h3>21929695</h3>Overexpression of a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, CYP6ER1, is associated with resistance to imidacloprid in the <span class="yellow">brown planthopper</span>, <span class="yellow">Nilaparvata lugens</span>. <br><br>The <span class="yellow">brown planthopper</span>, <span class="yellow">Nilaparvata lugens</span>, is an economically significant pest of <span class="yellow">rice</span> throughout Asia and has evolved resistance to many insecticides including the neonicotinoid imidacloprid. The resistance of field populations of <span class="yellow">N. lugens</span> to imidacloprid has been attributed to enhanced detoxification by cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), although, to date, the causative P450(s) has (have) not been identified. In the present study, biochemical assays using the model substrate 7-ethoxycoumarin showed enhanced P450 activity in several resistant <span class="yellow">N. lugens</span> field strains when compared with a susceptible reference strain. Thirty three cDNA sequences encoding tentative unique P450s were identified from two recent sequencing projects and by degenerate PCR. The mRNA expression level of 32 of these was examined in susceptible, moderately resistant and highly resistant <span class="yellow">N. lugens</span> strains using quantitative real-time PCR. <span class="red">A</span> single P450 gene (CYP6ER1) was highly overexpressed in all resistant strains (up to 40-fold) and the level of expression observed in the different <span class="yellow">N. lugens</span> strains was significantly correlated with the resistance phenotype. These results provide strong evidence for a role of CYP6ER1 in the resistance of <span class="yellow">N. lugens</span> to imidacloprid. 
<h3>22182611</h3>Laboratory and Field Evaluation of Formulated <span class="yellow">Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis</span> as a Feed Additive and Using Topical Applications for Control of <span class="yellow">Musca domestica</span> (Diptera: Muscidae) Larvae in Caged-Poultry Manure. <br><br>Infestations of <span class="yellow">house flies</span>, <span class="yellow">Musca domestica</span> L., are a continual problem around <span class="yellow">poultry</span> establishments. Acute toxicity of two commercial <span class="yellow">Bacillus thuringiensis variety israelensis</span> (<span class="yellow">Bti</span>) formulations (water-dispersible granules and bran formulation) was evaluated against larvae in the laboratory and against natural populations of <span class="yellow">M. domestica</span> larvae in the field applied in feed to <span class="yellow">chickens</span> and as topical applications in the <span class="yellow">poultry</span> houses. Bioassay data showed that susceptibility of <span class="yellow">M. domestica</span> larvae increased to a given concentration of <span class="yellow">Bti</span> as the duration of exposure increased. In the laboratory studies, the LC(50) values of <span class="yellow">Bti</span> for the larvae ranged between 65 and 77.4 mug/ml. In the field, a concentration of 10 g <span class="yellow">Bti</span>/kg of feed resulted in 90% reduction of larvae at 4 wk after treatment. <span class="red">A</span> higher concentration (2 g/liter) of <span class="yellow">Bti</span> in spray applications was not significantly more effective than the lower concentration of 1 g/liter. Adding <span class="yellow">Bti</span> to <span class="yellow">chicken</span> feed is potentially an efficient measure for the management and control of <span class="yellow">house flies</span> in caged-poultry facilities. 
<h3>22182620</h3>Influence of Sticky Trap Color and Height Above Ground on Capture of Alate <span class="yellow">Elatobium abietinum</span> (Hemiptera: Aphididae) in Sitka Spruce Plantations. <br><br>A series of field trials were used to assess the practicality of using sticky traps to monitor populations of green spruce aphid, <span class="yellow">Elatobium abietinum</span> (Walker), in plantations of <span class="yellow">Sitka spruce</span>. The highest numbers of alate <span class="yellow">E. abietinum</span> were caught on sticky traps placed in the upper third of the live canopy at 9-17 m above the ground, whereas low numbers of aphids were caught just below the live canopy or at 2 m above the ground. Trials in 2005 with sticky traps of different colors showed that significantly more alate <span class="yellow">E. abietinum</span> were caught on yellow, red, and green sticky traps than on white, blue, and <span class="yellow">black</span> traps. <span class="red">A</span> repeat trial in 2007 resulted in significantly more alate aphids being caught on red sticky traps than on traps of any other color except for green. Attraction to red is unusual among aphids, as aphids are thought not to possess a red-sensitive photoreceptor. The attraction of <span class="yellow">E. abietinum</span> to red-colored sticky traps suggests that conifer-feeding aphids might have a fundamentally different color response compared with aphids that live on cereals, grasses, or herbaceous plants. Alternatively, the attraction to red might be a physiological artifact related to the presence of red-screening pigments in the aphid's compound eye. 
<h3>22182621</h3>The Role of Frass and Cocoon Volatiles in Host Location by Monodontomerus aeneus, a Parasitoid of Megachilid Solitary Bees. <br><br>Monodontomerus aeneus (Fonscolombe) is a parasitic <span class="yellow">wasp</span> that oviposits on the prepupae and pupae of <span class="yellow">Osmia cornuta</span> (Latreille) and other solitary bee species. <span class="red">A</span> two-armed olfactometer was used to test the olfactory attractiveness of <span class="yellow">O. cornuta</span> prepupae, cocoon, and larval frass to female M. aeneus. Both cocoon and frass attracted the female parasitoids, but frass alone was more attractive than the cocoon and the cocoon with frass was more attractive than frass alone. Female parasitoids were not attracted by the host prepupa. M33 (methanol) was the organic volatile most emitted by cocoons and m61 (acetic acid) was the compound most emitted by frass. However, cocoons showed higher emission for almost all compounds, including m61 (acetic acid). Although acetic acid alone attracted M. aeneus, a complex volatile signal is probably involved in the attraction process because the ratio of acetic acid and acetaldehyde characteristic of the frass was more attractive than other ratios. 
<h3>20692868</h3>Highly diverse and seasonally dynamic protist community in a pristine peat bog.<br><br>Culture-independent molecular methods based on the amplification, cloning and sequencing of small-subunit ribosomal RNA genes (SSU rDNAs) are powerful tools to study the diversity of microorganisms. Despite so, the eukaryotic microbial diversity of many ecosystems, including peatlands has not yet received much attention. We analysed the eukaryotic diversity by molecular surveys in water from the centre of a pristine Sphagnum-dominated peatland in the Jura Mountains of Switzerland during a complete seasonal cycle. The clone libraries constructed from five different temporal samplings revealed a high diversity of protists with representatives of all major eukaryotic phyla. In addition, four sequence types could not be assigned to any known high-level eukaryotic taxon but branched together with a rather good statistic support, raising the possibility of a novel, deep branching eukaryotic clade. The analysis of seasonal patterns of phylotypes showed a clear change in the eukaryotic communities between the warm period (late spring and summer) and the cold period (autumn and winter). Chrysophytes dominated the samples in the cold period while testate amoebae (Arcellinida and Euglyphida) and a few other groups peaked in summer. <span class="red">A</span> few phylotypes (such as a cryptomonad and a perkinsid) were abundant at given sampling times and then almost disappeared, suggesting bloom-like dynamics. 
<h3>20854921</h3>Genomic evidence of repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) in filamentous ascomycetes. <br><br>The genomes of 49 filamentous ascomycetes (subphylum Pezizomycotina) were examined by two independent methods for evidence of multiple C->T transitions typical of RIP. At least one transposable element or other repeat family was identified in each genome, and members were assessed for transition and transversion mutations relative to a model of their intact progenitor. Occurrence of RIP was indicated where family members differed by excess of directional transitions over transversions. Transition mutations were quantified by an algorithm taking double mutations in CpG and CpC dinucleotides into account. <span class="red">A</span> second method assessed dinucleotide frequency distribution anomalies in whole genomes, a procedure that allowed quantification of fractions of the non-coding genome that had been subject to extensive directional mutation. The results of both methods revealed that RIP-like activity varied greatly, both in extent of mutation and in dinucleotide context for C->T transitions. In the most extreme case, 75% of a <span class="yellow">Blastomyces dermatitidis</span> genome had suffered conspicuous GC-depletion, all of it in the non-coding fraction. Many genomes carried both intact repeats as well as others that had suffered heavily from transitions. Only one species, <span class="yellow">Chaetomium globosum</span>, showed no evidence of directional mutation. 
<h3>20884368</h3>The <span class="yellow">Perigord black truffle</span> responds to cold temperature with an extensive reprogramming of its transcriptional activity. <br><br>The <span class="yellow">Tuber melanosporum</span> genome has been analysed with the aim of identifying and characterizing the genes involved in the environmental stress response. <span class="red">A</span> whole genome array (7496 genes/probe) was used to verify the <span class="yellow">fungal</span> transcriptional profiling upon a cold temperature period (7 days at 4 ^0C). <span class="red">A</span> total of 423 genes resulted to be differentially expressed in a significant manner (>2.5-fold; p-value&lt;0.05) in the mycelia exposed to cold, compared to the control ones: 187 of these genes were up-regulated, while 236 were down-regulated. Sixty-six and fifty-one percent, respectively, of the up- or down-regulated transcripts had no KOG classification and were clustered as unclassified proteins, which was the most abundant category in the both up- and down-regulated genes. <span class="red">A</span> gene subset, containing a range of biological functions, was chosen to validate the microarray experiment through quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). The analysis confirmed the array data for 16 out of 22 of the considered genes, confirming that a cold temperature period influences the <span class="yellow">truffle</span> global gene expression. The expressed genes, which mostly resulted to be genes for heat shock proteins (HSPs) and genes involved in cell wall and lipid metabolism, could be involved in mechanisms, which are responsible for <span class="yellow">fungal</span> adaptation. Since <span class="yellow">truffle</span> ascomata develop during the winter period, we hypothesize that these differentially expressed genes may help the <span class="yellow">truffle</span> to adapt to low temperatures and/or perceive environmental signals that regulate the fructification. 
<h3>20933542</h3>The rapid production of high-titer <span class="yellow">porcine endogenous retrovirus</span>(PERV)-B env pseudotype and construction of an EGFP-expressing replication competent <span class="yellow">PERV-A</span> vector. <br><br><span class="yellow">Porcine endogenous retroviruses</span> (<span class="yellow">PERVs</span>) present a unique concern associated with xenotransplantation because they have been shown to infect certain <span class="yellow">human</span> cells in vitro and it is also difficult to generate herds of <span class="yellow">pigs</span> free of <span class="yellow">PERVs</span>. <span class="red">A</span> simple system for the production of high-titer MoMLV-PERV pseudotypes is reported; an EGFP-expressing replication-competent molecular clone that allows direct measurement of titer was also constructed. To improve the MLV-based <span class="yellow">retroviral</span> vector system, a 2.1-kb <span class="yellow">PERV</span><span class="yellow">PERV-B</span> env product was amplified from PK-15 genomic DNA and cloned into the pCL-Eco <span class="yellow">retroviral</span> vector. The titer of lacZ (<span class="yellow">PERV-B</span>) from the 293 cells was about 1.0x10(4) CFU/ml. In contrast, the titer of lacZ (PERV-B) from a conventional murine <span class="yellow">retroviral</span> vector (split genome) was found to be 1.2x10(2) CFU/ml when the <span class="yellow">PERV-B</span> env expression vector was transfected into TELCeB6 cells, which harbor MFGnlslacZ and the gag-pol-expressing vector. In addition, an infectious <span class="yellow">PERV-A</span> clone containing enhanced GFP (EGFP) by using a PCR-based method was developed. This EGFP-expressing PERV-A-IRES-EGFP molecular clone was found to be stable genetically on transfection in 293 cells. 
<h3>20934313</h3>Rhizomastix biflagellata sp. nov., a new amoeboflagellate of uncertain phylogenetic position isolated from frogs. <br><br>The genus Rhizomastix contains five species of amoeboflagellates with a single anterior flagellum, which live as intestinal symbionts of insects and amphibians. Though established in 1911, Rhizomastix has been neglected for decades and its phylogenetic position is uncertain. This paper describes the morphology of the first cultivated strain of Rhizomastix. The organism was isolated from an argentine horned frog and differs from the known Rhizomastix species by the presence of biflagellate cells. The isolate is described as Rhizomastix biflagellata sp. nov. <span class="red">A</span> possible relationship of Rhizomastix to Archamoebae is discussed. 
<h3>20946420</h3>Association between nonsynonymous mutations of starch synthase IIa and starch quality in <span class="yellow">rice</span> (<span class="yellow">Oryza sativa</span>). <br><br>Starch quality is one of the most important agronomic traits in <span class="yellow">Asian rice</span>, <span class="yellow">Oryza sativa</span>. Starch synthase IIa (SsIIa) is a major candidate gene for starch quality variation. Within SsIIa, three nonsynonymous mutations in exon 8 have been shown to affect enzyme activity when expressed in <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span>. To search for the variation in SsIIa that is responsible for starch quality variation in <span class="yellow">rice</span>, we sequenced the SsIIa exon 8 region and measured starch quality as starch disintegration in alkali for 289 accessions of cultivated <span class="yellow">rice</span> and 57 accessions of its wild ancestor, <span class="yellow">Oryza rufipogon</span>. <span class="red">A</span> general linear model and nested clade analysis were used to identify the associations between the three nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and starch quality. Among the three nonsynonymous SNPs, we found strong evidence of association at one nucleotide site ('SNP 3'), corresponding to a Leu/Phe replacement at codon 781. <span class="red">A</span> second SNP, corresponding to a Val/Met replacement at codon 737, could potentially show an association with increased sample sizes. Variation in SsIIa enzyme activity is associated with the cohesiveness of <span class="yellow">rice</span> grains when cooked, and our findings are consistent with selection for more cohesive grains during the domestication of <span class="yellow">tropical japonica rice</span>. 
<h3>20946587</h3>Ecological differentiation in xylem cavitation resistance is associated with stem and leaf structural traits. <br><br>Cavitation resistance is a critical determinant of drought tolerance in tropical tree species, but little is known of its association with life history strategies, particularly for seasonal dry forests, a system critically driven by variation in water availability. We analysed vulnerability curves for saplings of 13 tropical dry forest tree species differing in life history and leaf phenology. We examined how vulnerability to cavitation (P50) related to dry season leaf water potentials and stem and leaf traits. P50-values ranged from -0.8 to -6.2 MPa, with pioneers on average 38% more vulnerable to cavitation than shade-tolerants. Vulnerability to cavitation was related to structural traits conferring tissue stress vulnerability, being negatively correlated with wood density, and surprisingly maximum vessel length. Vulnerability to cavitation was negatively related to the Huber-value and leaf dry matter content, and positively with leaf size. It was not related to SLA. We found a strong trade-off between cavitation resistance and hydraulic efficiency. Most species in the field were operating at leaf water potentials well above their P50, but pioneers and deciduous species had smaller hydraulic safety margins than shade-tolerants and evergreens. <span class="red">A</span> trade-off between hydraulic safety and efficiency underlies ecological differentiation across these tropical dry forest tree species. 
<h3>20951165</h3>The validation of a real-time RT-PCR assay which detects <span class="yellow">influenza A</span><span class="red">A</span> and types simultaneously for <span class="yellow">influenza A H1N1</span> (2009) and oseltamivir-resistant (H275Y) <span class="yellow">influenza A H1N1</span><span class="red">A</span> <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> (2009). <br><br>Influenza <span class="red">A</span> <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> (2009) was declared by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as the first <span class="yellow">influenza</span> pandemic of the 21st century. Rapid detection of <span class="yellow">influenza A</span><span class="red">A</span> and differentiation of <span class="yellow">influenza A H1N1</span><span class="red">A</span> <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> (2009) and seasonal <span class="yellow">influenza A</span><span class="red">A</span> is beneficial. In addition the rapid detection of antiviral resistant strains of <span class="yellow">influenza A H1N1</span><span class="red">A</span> <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> (2009) would be useful for clinicians to allow for change to an effective treatment at a much earlier stage if resistance is found. It was the aim of this study to develop a real-time RT-PCR that can detect all <span class="yellow">influenza A viruses</span> and type simultaneously for <span class="yellow">influenza A H1N1</span> (2009) and oseltamivir resistant (H275Y) <span class="yellow">influenza A H1N1</span> (2009). This multiplex assay will allow laboratories to screen respiratory samples for all types of <span class="yellow">influenza A</span>, <span class="yellow">influenza A H1N1</span> (2009) <span class="yellow">virus</span> and oseltamivir resistant (H275Y) <span class="yellow">influenza A H1N1</span> (2009) <span class="yellow">virus</span> in a rapid and cost effective format, ensuring that typing methods for seasonal and avian viruses are used on a smaller subset of samples. Since most virology laboratories already offer a molecular service for <span class="yellow">influenza A</span><span class="red">A</span> this assay could easily be implemented into most areas at little cost therefore increasing local access to resistance testing. 
<h3>20962082</h3>The alphaherpesvirus US3/ORF66 protein kinases direct phosphorylation of the nuclear matrix protein matrin 3. <br><br>The protein kinase found in the short region of alphaherpesviruses, termed US3 in <span class="yellow">herpes simplex virus type 1</span> (<span class="yellow">HSV-1</span>) and <span class="yellow">pseudorabies virus</span> (<span class="yellow">PRV</span>) and ORF66 in <span class="yellow">varicella-zoster virus</span> (<span class="yellow">VZV</span>), affects several <span class="yellow">viral</span> and host cell processes, and its specific targets remain an area of active investigation. Reports suggesting that <span class="yellow">HSV-1</span> US3 substrates overlap with those of cellular protein kinase <span class="red">A</span> (PKA) prompted the use of an antibody specific for phosphorylated PKA substrates to identify US3/ORF66 targets. <span class="yellow">HSV-1</span>, <span class="yellow">VZV</span>, and <span class="yellow">PRV</span> induced very different substrate profiles that were US3/ORF66 kinase dependent. The predominant <span class="yellow">VZV</span>-phosphorylated 125-kDa species was identified as matrin 3, one of the major nuclear matrix proteins. Matrin 3 was also phosphorylated by <span class="yellow">HSV-1</span> and <span class="yellow">PRV</span> in a US3 kinase-dependent manner and by <span class="yellow">VZV</span> ORF66 kinase at a novel residue (KRRRT150EE). Since <span class="yellow">VZV</span>-directed T150 phosphorylation was not blocked by PKA inhibitors and was not induced by PKA activation, and since PKA predominantly targeted matrin 3 S188, it was concluded that phosphorylation by <span class="yellow">VZV</span> was PKA independent. However, purified <span class="yellow">VZV</span> ORF66 kinase did not phosphorylate matrin 3 in vitro, suggesting that additional cellular factors were required. In <span class="yellow">VZV</span>-infected cells in the absence of the ORF66 kinase, matrin 3 displayed intranuclear changes, while matrin 3 showed a pronounced cytoplasmic distribution in late-stage cells infected with US3-negative <span class="yellow">HSV-1</span> or <span class="yellow">PRV</span>. This work identifies phosphorylation of the nuclear matrix protein matrin 3 as a new conserved target of this kinase group. 
<h3>20962083</h3>Small-molecule inhibition of <span class="yellow">human immunodeficiency virus type 1</span> infection by <span class="yellow">virus</span> capsid destabilization. <br><br><span class="yellow">Human immunodeficiency virus type 1</span> (<span class="yellow">HIV-1</span>) infection is dependent on the proper disassembly of the <span class="yellow">viral</span> capsid, or &quot;uncoating,&quot; in target cells. The <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span> capsid consists of a conical multimeric complex of the <span class="yellow">viral</span> capsid protein (CA) arranged in a hexagonal lattice. Mutations in CA that destabilize the <span class="yellow">viral</span> capsid result in impaired infection owing to defects in reverse transcription in target cells. We describe here the mechanism of action of a small molecule <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span> inhibitor, PF-3450074 (PF74), which targets CA. PF74 acts at an early stage of <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span> infection and inhibits reverse transcription in target cells. We show that PF74 binds specifically to <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span> particles, and substitutions in CA that confer resistance to the compound prevent binding. <span class="red">A</span> single point mutation in CA that stabilizes the <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span> core also conferred strong resistance to the <span class="yellow">virus</span> without inhibiting compound binding. Treatment of <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span> particles or purified cores with PF74 destabilized the <span class="yellow">viral</span> capsid in vitro. Furthermore, the compound induced the rapid dissolution of the <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span> capsid in target cells. PF74 antiviral activity was promoted by binding of the host protein cyclophilin <span class="red">A</span> to the <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span> capsid, and PF74 and cyclosporine exhibited mutual antagonism. Our data suggest that PF74 triggers premature <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span> uncoating in target cells, thereby mimicking the activity of the retrovirus restriction factor TRIM5alpha. This study highlights uncoating as a step in the <span class="yellow">HIV-1</span> life cycle that is susceptible to small molecule intervention. 
<h3>21029748</h3>One-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR assays for detecting and subtyping <span class="yellow">pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009</span>, <span class="yellow">seasonal influenza A/H1N1</span>, and <span class="yellow">seasonal influenza A/H3N2 viruses</span>. <br><br><span class="yellow">Pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 (A/H1N1pdm) virus</span> has caused significant outbreaks worldwide. <span class="red">A</span> previous one-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) assay for detecting <span class="yellow">A/H1N1pdm virus</span> (H1pdm rRT-PCR assay) was improved since the former probe had a low melting temperature and low tolerance to <span class="yellow">viral</span> mutation. To help with the screening of the <span class="yellow">A/H1N1pdm virus</span>, rRT-PCR assays were also developed for detecting <span class="yellow">human</span> <span class="yellow">seasonal A/H1N1</span> (H1 rRT-PCR assay) and <span class="yellow">A/H3N2 influenza viruses</span> (H3 rRT-PCR assay). H1pdm, <span class="yellow">H1</span>, and H3 rRT-PCR assays were evaluated using in vitro-transcribed control RNA, isolated viruses, and other respiratory pathogenic viruses, and were shown to have high sensitivity, good linearity (R(2)=0.99), and high specificity. In addition, the improved H1pdm rRT-PCR assay could detect two <span class="yellow">viral strains of A/H1N1pdm</span>, namely, <span class="yellow">A/Aichi/472/2009 (H1N1)pdm</span> and <span class="yellow">A/Sakai/89/2009 (H1N1)pdm</span>, which have mutation(s) in the probe-binding region of the hemagglutinin gene, without loss of sensitivity. Using the three rRT-PCR assays developed, 90 clinical specimens collected between May and October 2009 were then tested. Of these, 26, 20, and 2 samples were identified as positive for <span class="yellow">A/H1pdm</span>, <span class="yellow">A/H3</span>, and <span class="yellow">A/H1</span>, respectively, while 42 samples were negative for <span class="yellow">influenza A viruses</span>. The present results suggest that these highly sensitive and specific H1pdm, <span class="yellow">H1</span>, and H3 rRT-PCR assays are useful not only for diagnosing <span class="yellow">influenza viruses</span>, but also for the surveillance of <span class="yellow">influenza viruses</span>. 
<h3>21067947</h3>Characterizing the role of RNA silencing components in <span class="yellow">Cryptococcus neoformans</span>. <br><br>The RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by homology-dependent degradation of the target mRNA with small RNA molecules plays a key role in controlling transcription and translation processes in a number of eukaryotic organisms. The RNAi machinery is also evolutionarily conserved in a wide variety of <span class="yellow">fungal</span> species, including pathogenic fungi. To elucidate the physiological functions of the RNAi pathway in <span class="yellow">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> that causes <span class="yellow">fungal</span> meningitis, here we performed genetic analyses for genes encoding Argonaute (AGO1 and AGO2), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDP1), and Dicers (DCR1 and DCR2) in both <span class="yellow">serotype A</span><span class="red">A</span> and D <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span>. The present study shows that Ago1, Rdp1, and Dcr2 are the major components of the RNAi process occurring in <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span>. However, the RNAi machinery is not involved in regulation of production of two virulence factors (capsule and melanin), sexual differentiation, and diverse stress response. Comparative transcriptome analysis of the <span class="yellow">serotype A</span><span class="red">A</span> and D RNAi mutants revealed that only modest changes occur in the genome-wide transcriptome profiles when the RNAi process was perturbed. Notably, the serotype D rdp1Delta mutants showed an increase in transcript abundance of active retrotransposons and transposons, such as T2 and T3, the latter of which is a novel serotype D-specific transposon of <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span>. In a wild type background both T2 and T3 were found to be weakly active mobile elements, although we found no evidence of Cnl1 retrotransposon mobility. In contrast, all three transposable elements exhibited enhanced mobility in the rdp1Delta mutant strain. In conclusion, the RNAi pathway plays an important role in controlling transposon activity and genome integrity of <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span>. 
<h3>21075923</h3>Fur negatively regulates hns and is required for the expression of HilA and virulence in <span class="yellow">Salmonella enterica</span><span class="yellow">Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium</span>. <br><br>Iron is an essential element for the survival of living cells. However, excess iron is toxic, and its uptake is exquisitely regulated by the ferric uptake regulator, Fur. In Salmonella, the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) encodes a type three secretion system, which is required for invasion of host epithelial cells in the small intestine. <span class="red">A</span> major activator of SPI-1 is HilA, which is encoded within SPI-1. One known regulator of hilA is Fur. The mechanism of hilA regulation by Fur is unknown. We report here that Fur is required for virulence in <span class="yellow">Salmonella enterica</span><span class="yellow">Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium</span> and that Fur is required for the activation of hilA, as well as of other HilA-dependent genes, invF and sipC. The Fur-dependent regulation of hilA was independent of PhoP, a known repressor of hilA. Instead, the expression of the gene coding for the histone-like protein, hns, was significantly derepressed in the fur mutant. Indeed, the activation of hilA by Fur was dependent on 28 nucleotides located upstream of hns. Moreover, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation to show that Fur bound, in vivo, to the upstream region of hns in a metal-dependent fashion. Finally, deletion of fur in an hns mutant resulted in Fur-independent activation of hilA. In conclusion, Fur activates hilA by repressing the expression of hns. 
<h3>21075931</h3>MexT regulates the type III secretion system through MexS and PtrC in <span class="yellow">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>. <br><br>The type III secretion system (T3SS) is the most important virulence factor in <span class="yellow">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>, and its expression level varies in different isolates. We studied the molecular basis for such differences in two laboratory strains, PAK and PAO1. <span class="red">A</span> chromosomal clone library from the high-T3SS-producer strain PAK was introduced into the low-producer strain PAO1, and we found that a mexS gene from PAK confers high T3SS expression in the PAO1 background. Further tests demonstrated that both mexS and its neighboring mexT gene are required for the repression of the T3SS in PAO1, while the PAK genome encodes a defective MexS, accounting for the derepression of the T3SS in PAK and the dominant negative effect when it is introduced into PAO1. MexS is a probable oxidoreductase whose expression is dependent on MexT, a LysR-type transcriptional regulator. Various genetic data support the idea that MexS modulates the transcriptional regulator function of MexT. In searching for the MexT-dependent repressor of the T3SS, a small gene product of PA2486 (ptrC) was found effective in suppressing the T3SS upon overexpression. However, deletion of ptrC in the PAO1 background did not result in derepression of the T3SS, indicating the presence of another repressor for the T3SS. Interestingly, overexpression of functional mexS alone was sufficient to repress T3SS even in the absence of MexT, suggesting that MexS is another mediator of MexT-dependent T3SS repression. Overexpression of mexS alone had no effect on the well-known MexT-dependent genes, including those encoding MexEF efflux pump, elastase, and pyocyanin, indicating alternative regulatory mechanisms. <span class="red">A</span> model has been proposed for the MexS/MexT-mediated regulation of the T3SS, the MexEF efflux pump, and the production of elastase and pyocyanin. 
<h3>21115655</h3>Citrate uptake in exchange with intermediates in the citrate metabolic pathway in <span class="yellow">Lactococcus lactis</span> <span class="yellow">IL1403</span>. <br><br>Carbohydrate/citrate cometabolism in <span class="yellow">Lactococcus lactis</span> results in the formation of the flavor compound acetoin. Resting cells of strain <span class="yellow">IL1403</span>(pFL3) rapidly consumed citrate while producing acetoin when substoichiometric concentrations of glucose or l-lactate were present. <span class="red">A</span> proton motive force was generated by electrogenic exchange of citrate and lactate catalyzed by the citrate transporter CitP and proton consumption in decarboxylation reactions in the pathway. In the absence of glucose or l-lactate, citrate consumption was biphasic. During the first phase, hardly any citrate was consumed. In the second phase, citrate was converted rapidly, but without the formation of acetoin. Instead, significant amounts of the intermediates pyruvate and alpha-acetolactate, and the end product acetate, were excreted from the cells. It is shown that the intermediates and acetate are excreted in exchange with the uptake of citrate catalyzed by CitP. The availability of exchangeable substrates in the cytoplasm determines both the rate of citrate consumption and the end product profile. It follows that citrate metabolism in <span class="yellow">L. lactis</span> IL1403(pFL3) splits up in two routes after the formation of pyruvate, one the well-characterized route yielding acetoin and the other a new route yielding acetate. The flux distribution between the two branches changes from 85:15 in the presence of l-lactate to 30:70 in the presence of pyruvate. The proton motive force generated was greatest in the presence of l-lactate and zero in the presence of pyruvate, suggesting that the pathway to acetate does not generate proton motive force. 
<h3>21115658</h3>Interbacterial macromolecular transfer by the <span class="yellow">Campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis</span> type IV secretion system. <br><br>We report here the first demonstration of intra- and interspecies conjugative plasmid DNA transfer for <span class="yellow">Campylobacter fetus</span>. Gene regions carried by a <span class="yellow">Campylobacter coli</span> plasmid were identified that are sufficient for conjugative mobilization to <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span> and <span class="yellow">C. fetus</span> recipients. <span class="red">A</span> broader functional range is predicted. Efficient DNA transfer involves the virB9 and virD4 genes of the type IV bacterial secretion system encoded by a pathogenicity island of <span class="yellow">C. fetus subsp. venerealis</span>. Complementation of these phenotypes from expression constructions based on the promoter of the <span class="yellow">C. fetus</span> surface antigen protein (sap) locus was temperature dependent, and a temperature regulation of the sap promoter was subsequently confirmed under laboratory conditions. Gene transfer was sensitive to surface or entry exclusion functions in potential recipient cells carrying IncPalpha plasmid RP4 implying functional relatedness to <span class="yellow">C. fetus</span> proteins. The virB/virD4 locus is also known to be involved in bacterial invasion and killing of cultured <span class="yellow">human</span> cells in vitro. Whether specifically secreted effector proteins contribute to host colonization and infection activities is currently unknown. Two putative effector proteins carrying an FIC domain conserved in a few bacterial type III and type IV secreted proteins of pathogens were analyzed for secretion by the <span class="yellow">C. fetus</span> or heterologous conjugative systems. No evidence for interbacterial translocation of the Fic proteins was found. 
<h3>21118199</h3>Canopy connectivity and the availability of diverse nesting resources affect species coexistence in arboreal ants. <br><br>1. Arboreal ants are both diverse and ecologically dominant in the tropics. Such ecologically important groups are likely to be particularly useful in ongoing empirical efforts to understand the processes that regulate species diversity and coexistence. 2. Our study addresses how access to tree-based resources and the diversity of pre-existing nesting cavities affect species diversity and coexistence in tropical arboreal ant assemblages. We focus on assemblage-level responses to these variables at local scales. We first surveyed arboreal ant diversity across three naturally occurring levels of canopy connectivity and a gradient of tree size. We then conducted whole-tree experimental manipulations of canopy connectivity and the diversity of cavity entrance sizes. All work was conducted in the Brazilian savanna or 'cerrado'. 3. Our survey suggested that species richness was equivalent among levels of connectivity. However, there was a consistent trend of lower species density with low canopy connectivity. This was confirmed at the scale of individual trees, with low-connectivity trees having significantly fewer species across all tree sizes. Our experiment demonstrated directly that low canopy connectivity results in significantly fewer species coexisting per tree. 4. <span class="red">A</span> diverse array of cavity entrance sizes did not significantly increase overall species per tree. Nevertheless, cavity diversity did significantly increase the species using new cavities on each tree, the species per tree unique to new cavities, total species using new cavities, and total cavity use. The populations of occupied cavities were consistent with newly founded colonies and new nests of established colonies from other trees. Cavity diversity thus appears to greatly affect new colony founding and colony growth. 5. These results contribute strong evidence that greater resource access and greater cavity diversity have positive effects on species coexistence in local arboreal ant assemblages. More generally, these positive effects are broadly consistent with niche differentiation promoting local species coexistence in diverse arboreal ant assemblages. The contributions of this study to the understanding of the processes of species coexistence are discussed, along with the potential of the focal system for future work on this issue. 
<h3>21126599</h3>The pH regulatory factor Pac1 regulates Tri gene expression and trichothecene production in <span class="yellow">Fusarium graminearum</span>. <br><br>Fungi manage the adaptation to extra-cellular pH through the PacC transcription factor, a key component of the pH regulatory system. PacC regulates the production of various secondary metabolites in filamentous fungi. In the important cereal pathogen <span class="yellow">Fusarium graminearum</span>, the production of trichothecene is induced only under acidic pH conditions. Here, we examined the role of the PacC homologue from <span class="yellow">F. graminearum</span>, FgPac1, on the regulation of trichothecene production. An FgDeltaPac1 deletion mutant was constructed in <span class="yellow">F. graminearum</span> which showed a reduced development under neutral and alkaline pH, increased sensitivity to H(2)O(2) and an earlier Tri gene induction and toxin accumulation at acidic pH. <span class="red">A</span> strain expressing the FgPac1(c) constitutively active form of Pac1 exhibited a strongly repressed Tri gene expression and reduced toxin accumulation at acidic pH. These results demonstrate that Pac1 negatively regulates Tri gene expression and toxin production in <span class="yellow">F. graminearum</span>. 
<h3>21131487</h3>A caffeyl-coenzyme <span class="red">A</span> synthetase initiates caffeate activation prior to caffeate reduction in the acetogenic bacterium <span class="yellow">Acetobacterium woodii</span>. <br><br>The anaerobic acetogenic bacterium <span class="yellow">Acetobacterium woodii</span> couples the reduction of caffeate with electrons derived from hydrogen to the synthesis of ATP by a chemiosmotic mechanism using sodium ions as coupling ions, but the enzymes involved remain to be established. Previously, the electron transfer flavoproteins EtfA and EtfB were found to be involved in caffeate respiration. By inverse PCR, we identified three genes upstream of etfA and etfB: carA, carB, and carC. carA encodes a potential coenzyme <span class="red">A</span> (CoA) transferase, carB an acyl-CoA synthetase, and carC an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. carA, -B, and -C are located together with etfA/carE and etfB/carD on one polycistronic message, indicating that CarA, CarB, and CarC are also part of the caffeate respiration pathway. The genetic data suggest an initial ATP-dependent activation of caffeate by CarB. To prove the proposed function of CarB, the protein was overproduced in <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span>, and the recombinant protein was purified. Purified CarB activates caffeate to caffeyl-CoA in an ATP- and CoA-dependent reaction. The enzyme has broad pH and temperature optima and requires K(+) for activity. In addition to caffeate, it can use p-coumarate, ferulate, and cinnamate as substrates, with 50, 15, and 9%, respectively, of the activity obtained with caffeate. Expression of the car operon is induced not only by caffeate, p-coumarate, ferulate, and cinnamate but also by sinapate. There is no induction by p-hydroxybenzoate or syringate. 
<h3>21155771</h3>Growth and reproductive costs of larval defence in the aposematic lepidopteran <span class="yellow">Pieris brassicae</span>. <br><br>1. Utilization of plant secondary compounds for antipredator defence is common in immature herbivorous insects. Such defences may incur a cost to the animal, either in terms of survival, growth rate or in the reproductive success. 2. <span class="red">A</span> common defence in lepidopterans is the regurgitation of semi-digested material containing the defensive compounds of the food plant, a defence which has led to gut specialization in this order. Regurgitation is often swift in response to cuticular stimulation and deters predators from consuming or parasitizing the larva. The loss of food and other gut material seems likely to impact on fitness, but evidence is lacking. 3. Here, we raised larvae of the common crop pest <span class="yellow">Pieris brassicae</span> on commercial <span class="yellow">cabbage</span> leaves, simulated predator attacks throughout the larval period, and measured life-history responses. 4. We found that the probability of survival to pupation decreased with increasing frequency of attacks, but this was because of regurgitation rather than the stimulation itself. There was a growth cost to the defence such that the more regurgitant that individuals produced over the growth period, the smaller they were at pupation. 5. The number of mature eggs in adult females was positively related to pupal mass, but this relationship was only found when individuals were not subjected to a high frequency of predator simulation. This suggests that there might be cryptic fitness costs to common defensive responses that are paid despite apparent growth rate being maintained. 6. Our results demonstrate a clear life-history cost of an antipredator defence in a model pest species and show that under certain conditions, such as high predation threat, the expected relationship between female body size and potential fecundity can be disrupted. 
<h3>21176788</h3>Hyphal and cytoskeleton polarization in <span class="yellow">Tuber melanosporum</span>: a genomic and cellular analysis. <br><br>Filamentous polarized growth involves a series of events including polarization of the cytoskeleton to selected growth sites, and the transport of secretory vesicles containing the components required for growth. The availability of <span class="yellow">fungal</span> genome sequences has recently led to the identification of a large number of proteins involved in these processes. We have explored the <span class="yellow">Tuber melanosporum</span> genome sequence by searching for homologs of genes known to play crucial roles in the morphogenesis and cell polarity of <span class="yellow">yeasts</span> and filamentous fungi. One hundred and forty-nine genes have been identified and functionally grouped according to the deduced amino acid sequences (44 genes involved in cell polarity/morphogenesis, 39 belonging to the actin cytoskeleton and 66 involved in membrane dynamics, septation and exocytosis). <span class="red">A</span> detailed gene annotation has shown that most components of the cell polarity machinery, morphogenesis and cytoskeleton found in <span class="yellow">yeasts</span> and filamentous fungi are conserved, although the degree of similarity varies from strong to weak. Microscopic analysis of quick-frozen <span class="yellow">truffle</span> hyphae detected the characteristic subcellular components of the hyphal tip in septate filamentous fungi, while transcript profiles revealed a moderately variable pattern during the biological cycle. 
<h3>21227500</h3>Continuing challenge of infectious diseases in India.<br><br>In India, the range and burden of infectious diseases are enormous. The administrative responsibilities of the health system are shared between the central (federal) and state governments. Control of diseases and outbreaks is the responsibility of the central Ministry of Health, which lacks a formal public health department for this purpose. Tuberculosis, malaria, filariasis, visceral leishmaniasis, leprosy, <span class="yellow">HIV</span> infection, and childhood cluster of vaccine-preventable diseases are given priority for control through centrally managed vertical programmes. Control of <span class="yellow">HIV</span> infection and leprosy, but not of tuberculosis, seems to be on track. Early success of malaria control was not sustained, and visceral leishmaniasis prevalence has increased. Inadequate containment of the vector has resulted in recurrent outbreaks of <span class="yellow">dengue</span> fever and re-emergence of <span class="yellow">Chikungunya virus</span> disease and typhus fever. Other infectious diseases caused by faecally transmitted pathogens (enteric fevers, cholera, <span class="yellow">hepatitis A</span> and <span class="yellow">E viruses</span>) and zoonoses (rabies, leptospirosis, anthrax) are not in the process of being systematically controlled. Big gaps in the surveillance and response system for infectious diseases need to be addressed. Replication of the model of vertical single-disease control for all infectious diseases will not be efficient or viable. India needs to rethink and revise its health policy to broaden the agenda of disease control. <span class="red">A</span> comprehensive review and redesign of the health system is needed urgently to ensure equity and quality in health care. We recommend the creation of a functional public health infrastructure that is shared between central and state governments, with professional leadership and a formally trained public health cadre of personnel who manage an integrated control mechanism of diseases in districts that includes infectious and non-infectious diseases, and injuries. 
<h3>21324422</h3>A clone-based transcriptomics approach for the identification of genes relevant for itaconic acid production in Aspergillus. <br><br>Several Aspergillus species are well-known for the production of a variety of organic acids. In this study, a cloned based transcriptomics approach was used to identify genes crucial in the biosynthesis pathway for one of these acids, itaconic acid. From a number of different <span class="yellow">Aspergillus terreus</span> controlled batch fermentations, those cultures with the largest difference in itaconic acid titer and productivity were selected for mRNA isolation. cDNAs derived from these mRNA samples were used for subsequent hybridization of glass slide arrays based on a collection of 5000 cDNA clones. <span class="red">A</span> selection of 13 cDNA clones resulting in the strongest (>10-fold) differential hybridization signals were identified and subsequently the inserts of these clones were sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of in total five different gene inserts among the sequenced clones. From one of these sequences, encoding a gene of the MmgE-PrpD family, the full length coding region was shown to encode one of the crucial itaconic acid pathway enzymes cis-aconitate decarboxylase, by heterologous expression in <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span>. Expression of this gene in <span class="yellow">Aspergillus niger</span>, which is a natural citric acid producer, resulted in itaconate production. Genome analysis suggests that in <span class="yellow">A. terreus</span> the cis-aconitate decarboxylase gene is part of an itaconate acid related gene cluster including genes encoding two pathway specific transporters and a Zinc finger protein. Interestingly, this cluster is directly linked to the large lovastatin gene cluster. 
<h3>21349119</h3>Differentially expressed genes in <span class="yellow">silkworm</span> cell cultures in response to infection by Wolbachia and Cardinium endosymbionts. <br><br>Wolbachia and Cardinium are bacterial endosymbionts that are widely distributed amongst arthropods. Both cause reproductive alterations, such as cytoplasmic incompatibility, parthenogenesis and feminization. Here we studied differentially expressed genes in Wolbachia- and Cardinium-infected Bm-aff3 <span class="yellow">silkworm</span> cells using a <span class="yellow">silkworm</span> microarray. Wolbachia infection did not alter gene expression or induce or suppress immune responses. In contrast, Cardinium infection induced many immune-related genes, including antimicrobial peptides, pattern recognition receptors and a serine protease. Host immune responses differed, possibly because of the different cell wall structures of Wolbachia and Cardinium because the former lacks genes encoding lipopolysaccharide components and two racemases for peptidoglycan formation. <span class="red">A</span> few possibly non-immune-related genes were differentially expressed, but their involvement in host reproductive alteration was unclear. 
<h3>21349120</h3>Neuropeptide Y-like signalling and nutritionally mediated gene expression and behaviour in the <span class="yellow">honey bee</span>. <br><br>Previous research has led to the idea that derived traits can arise through the evolution of novel roles for conserved genes. We explored whether neuropeptide Y (NPY)-like signalling, a conserved pathway that regulates food-related behaviour, is involved in a derived, nutritionally-related trait, the division of labour in worker <span class="yellow">honey bees</span>. Transcripts encoding two NPY-like peptides were expressed in separate populations of brain neurosecretory cells, consistent with endocrine functions. NPY-related genes were upregulated in the brains of older foragers compared with younger bees performing brood care ('nurses'). <span class="red">A</span> subset of these changes can be attributed to nutrition, but neuropeptide F peptide treatments did not influence sugar intake. These results contrast with recent reports of more robust associations between division of labour and the related insulin-signalling pathway and suggest that some elements of molecular pathways associated with feeding behaviour may be more evolutionarily labile than others. 
<h3>21435060</h3>Characterization of an omega-class glutathione S-transferase in the stress response of the <span class="yellow">silkmoth</span>. <br><br>The glutathione S-transferase (GST) superfamily is involved in detoxification of various xenobiotics. Using real-time PCR, mRNA encoding an omega-class GST of <span class="yellow">Bombyx mori</span> (bmGSTO) was shown to be induced after exposure to various environmental stresses. <span class="red">A</span> soluble form of recombinant protein (rbmGSTO) was functionally overexpressed in <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span> cells and purified to homogeneity. Cys 38 and Pro 39 were found to be highly conserved in omega-class GSTs, and their roles were investigated by site-directed mutagenesis/kinetic analysis. Mutations of Cys 38 and Pro 39 residues affected the catalytic efficiency of enzymes, indicating that the presence of Cys 38 and Pro 39 residues is important for bmGSTO activity. Thus, bmGSTO could contribute to increasing the environmental stress resistance of lepidopteran insects. 
<h3>21450337</h3>Osteoporosis: now and the future.<br><br>Osteoporosis is a common disease characterised by a systemic impairment of bone mass and microarchitecture that results in fragility fractures. With an ageing population, the medical and socioeconomic effect of osteoporosis, particularly postmenopausal osteoporosis, will increase further. <span class="red">A</span> detailed knowledge of bone biology with molecular insights into the communication between bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts and the orchestrating signalling network has led to the identification of novel therapeutic targets. Novel treatment strategies have been developed that aim to inhibit excessive bone resorption and increase bone formation. The most promising novel treatments include: denosumab, a monoclonal antibody for receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand, a key osteoclast cytokine; odanacatib, a specific inhibitor of the osteoclast protease cathepsin K; and antibodies against the proteins sclerostin and dickkopf-1, two endogenous inhibitors of bone formation. This overview discusses these novel therapies and explains their underlying physiology. 
<h3>21529147</h3>Growth inhibition of <span class="yellow">Beauveria bassiana</span> by bacteria isolated from the cuticular surface of the <span class="yellow">corn leafhopper</span>, <span class="yellow">Dalbulus maidis</span> and the planthopper, <span class="yellow">Delphacodes kuscheli</span>, two important vectors of <span class="yellow">maize</span> pathogens. <br><br>The phytosanitary importance of the <span class="yellow">corn</span><span class="yellow">corn leafhopper</span>, <span class="yellow">Dalbulus maidis</span> (De Long and Wolcott) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) and the planthopper, <span class="yellow">Delphacodes kuscheli</span> Fennah (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) lies in their ability to transmit phloem-associated plant pathogens, mainly viruses and mollicutes, and to cause considerable mechanical damage to <span class="yellow">corn</span> plants during feeding and oviposition. Fungi, particularly some members of the Ascomycota, are likely candidates for biocontrol agents against these insect pests, but several studies revealed their failure to invade the insect cuticle possibly because of the presence of inhibitory compounds such as phenols, quinones, and lipids and also by the antibiosis effect of the microbiota living on the cuticular surface of the host. The present work aims to understand interactions between the entomopathogenic fungus <span class="yellow">Beauveria bassiana</span> (Balsamao-Crivelli) Vuillemin (Hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae) and bacterial antagonists isolated from the cuticular surface of <span class="yellow">D. maidis</span> and <span class="yellow">D. kuscheli</span>. <span class="red">A</span> total of 155 bacterial isolates were recovered from the insect's cuticle and tested against <span class="yellow">B. bassiana</span>. Ninety-one out of 155 strains inhibited the growth of <span class="yellow">B. bassiana</span>. Bacterial strains isolated from <span class="yellow">D. maidis</span> were significantly more antagonistic against <span class="yellow">B. bassiana</span> than those isolates from <span class="yellow">D. kuscheli</span>. Among the most effective antagonistic strains, six isolates of <span class="yellow">Bacillus thuringiensis</span> Berliner (Bacillales: Bacillaeae (after <span class="yellow">B. subtilis</span>)), one isolate of <span class="yellow">B. mycoides</span> Flugge, eight isolates of <span class="yellow">B. megaterium</span> de Bary, five isolates of <span class="yellow">B.pumilus</span> Meyer and Gottheil, one isolate of <span class="yellow">B. licheniformis</span> (Weigmann) Chester, and four isolates of <span class="yellow">B. subtilis</span> (Ehrenberg) Cohn were identified. 
<h3>21601644</h3>Analysis of the <span class="yellow">Fusarium graminearum species complex</span> from <span class="yellow">wheat</span>, <span class="yellow">barley</span> and <span class="yellow">maize</span> in South Africa provides evidence of species-specific differences in host preference. <br><br>Species identity and trichothecene toxin potential of 560 members of the <span class="yellow">Fusarium graminearum species complex</span> (<span class="yellow">FGSC</span>) collected from diseased <span class="yellow">wheat</span>, <span class="yellow">barley</span> and <span class="yellow">maize</span> in South Africa was determined using a microsphere-based multilocus genotyping assay. Although three trichothecene types (3-ADON, 15-ADON and NIV) were represented among these isolates, strains with the 15-ADON type predominated on all three hosts. <span class="red">A</span> significant difference, however, was identified in the composition of <span class="yellow">FGSC</span> pathogens associated with Gibberella ear rot (GER) of <span class="yellow">maize</span> as compared to Fusarium head blight (FHB) of <span class="yellow">wheat</span> or <span class="yellow">barley</span> (P&lt;0.001). <span class="yellow">F. graminearum</span> accounted for more than 85% of the <span class="yellow">FGSC</span> isolates associated with FHB of <span class="yellow">wheat</span> and <span class="yellow">barley</span> (N=425), and was also the dominant species among isolates from <span class="yellow">maize</span> roots (N=35). However, with the exception of a single isolate identified as an interspecific hybrid between <span class="yellow">Fusariumboothii</span> and <span class="yellow">F. graminearum</span>, GER of <span class="yellow">maize</span> (N=100) was exclusively associated with <span class="yellow">F. boothii</span>. The predominance of <span class="yellow">F. graminearum</span> among FHB isolates, and the near exclusivity of <span class="yellow">F. boothii</span> among GER isolates, was observed across all cultivars, collection dates, and provinces sampled. Because these results suggest a difference in host preference among species of the <span class="yellow">FGSC</span>, we hypothesize that <span class="yellow">F. graminearum</span> may be less well adapted to infect <span class="yellow">maize</span> ears than other members of the <span class="yellow">FGSC</span>. 
<h3>21689185</h3>Synganglion transcriptome and developmental global gene expression in adult females of the <span class="yellow">American dog tick</span>, <span class="yellow">Dermacentor variabilis</span> (Acari: Ixodidae). <br><br>454 Pyrosequencing was used to characterize the expressed genes from the synganglion and associated neurosecretory organs of unfed and partially fed virgin and mated replete females of the <span class="yellow">American dog tick</span>, <span class="yellow">Dermacentor variabilis</span>. <span class="red">A</span> total of 14,881 contiguous sequences (contigs) was assembled, with an average size of 229 bp. Gene ontology terms for Level 2 biological processes were assigned to 4366 contigs. Seven acetylcholinesterases, a muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor, two nicotinic ACh receptor Beta-subunits, two ACh unc-18 regulators, two dopamine receptors, two gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, two GABA transporters, two norepinephrine transporters and an octopamine receptor are described. Microarrays were conducted to examine global gene expression and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to verify expression of selected neuropeptides. Hierarchical clustering of all differentially expressed transcripts grouped part-fed and replete ticks as being more similar in terms of differentially expressed genes with unfed ticks as the outgroup. Nine putative neuropeptides (allatostatin, bursicon-Beta, preprocorazonin, glycoprotein hormone alpha, insulin-like peptide, three orcokinins, preprosulphakinin) and a gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor were differentially expressed, and their developmental expression and role in reproduction was investigated. The presence of eclosion hormone, corazonin and bursicon in the synganglion, which in insects regulate behaviour and cuticle development associated with moulting, suggest that this system may be used in ticks to regulate blood feeding, cuticle expansion and development related to female reproduction; adult ticks do not moult. 
<h3>20955226</h3>Separating parental environment from seed size effects on next generation growth and development in <span class="yellow">Arabidopsis</span>. <br><br>Plant growth and development is profoundly influenced by environmental conditions that laboratory experimentation typically attempts to control. However, growth conditions are not uniform between or even within laboratories and the extent to which these differences influence plant growth and development is unknown. Experiments with wild-type <span class="yellow">Arabidopsis thaliana</span> were designed to quantify the influences of parental environment and seed size on growth and development in the next generation. <span class="red">A</span> single lot of seed was planted in six environmental chambers and grown to maturity. The seed produced was mechanically sieved into small and large size classes then grown in a common environment and subjected to a set of assays spanning the life cycle. Analysis of variance demonstrated that seed size effects were particularly significant early in development, affecting primary root growth and gravitropism, but also flowering time. Parental environment affected progeny germination time, flowering and weight of seed the progeny produced. In some cases, the parental environment affected the magnitude of (interacted with) the observed seed size effects. These data indicate that life history circumstances of the parental generation can affect growth and development throughout the life cycle of the next generation to an extent that should be considered when performing genetic studies. 
<h3>20955241</h3>The first vitellogenin receptor from a Lepidopteran insect: molecular characterization, expression patterns and RNA interference analysis. <br><br>The vitellogenin receptor (VgR) belongs to the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) superfamily, and is an important carrier for the uptake of vitellogenin (Vg) into developing oocytes of all oviparous species. The first full-length message for a VgR from a Lepidopteran insect was cloned and sequenced from the ovary of <span class="yellow">Spodoptera litura Fabricius</span> (GenBank accession no. GU983858). The coding region consisted of 5370 bp flanked by a 49 bp 5'-untranslated region (UTR) and a 177 bp 3'-UTR, which encoded a 1798-residue protein with a predicted molecular weight (MW) of 201.69 kDa. <span class="yellow">S. litura</span> VgR (SlVgR)comprised two ligand binding sites with four LDLR class <span class="red">A</span> repeats in the first domain and seven in the second domain, an epidermal growth factor-like domain containing an LDLR class B repeat and a YWXD motif, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain. <span class="red">A</span> phylogenetic relationship placed SlVgR as a separate group from the other insects. SlVgR messenger RNA (mRNA) was specifically expressed in the ovarian tissues. The developmental expression patterns showed that VgR mRNA was first transcribed in 6(th) day female pupae and the maximum level of VgR mRNA appeared in 36-h-old adults. Immunoblot analysis detected an ovary-specific VgR protein with a MW of -200 kDa, whose development profiles were consistent with VgR mRNA expression patterns. RNA inteference (RNAi) specifically disrupted the VgR gene by injection of 3 or 5 mug VgR double-stranded RNA per insect in 4(th) or 6(th) day pupae. RNAi of SlVgR led to a phenotype characterized by high Vg accumulation in the haemolymph, low Vg deposition in the ovary and the failure of insect spawning. These results mean that VgR is critical for binding Vg and transporting it into the oocytes of the insect ovary, thus playing an important role in insect reproduction. 
<h3>21075926</h3>Type I signal peptidase and protein secretion in <span class="yellow">Staphylococcus epidermidis</span>.<br><br>Bacterial protein secretion is a highly orchestrated process that is essential for infection and virulence. Despite extensive efforts to predict or experimentally detect proteins that are secreted, the characterization of the bacterial secretome has remained challenging. <span class="red">A</span> central event in protein secretion is the type I signal peptidase (SPase)-mediated cleavage of the N-terminal signal peptide that targets a protein for secretion via the general secretory pathway, and the arylomycins are a class of natural products that inhibit SPase, suggesting that they may be useful chemical biology tools for characterizing the secretome. Here, using an arylomycin derivative, along with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we identify 11 proteins whose secretion from stationary-phase <span class="yellow">Staphylococcus epidermidis</span> is dependent on SPase activity, 9 of which are predicted to be translated with canonical N-terminal signal peptides. In addition, we find that the presence of extracellular domains of lipoteichoic acid synthase (LtaS) and the Beta-lactam response sensor BlaR1 in the medium is dependent on SPase activity, suggesting that they are cleaved at noncanonical sites within the protein. In all, the data define the proteins whose stationary-phase secretion depends on SPase and also suggest that the arylomycins should be valuable chemical biology tools for the study of protein secretion in a wide variety of different bacteria. 
<h3>21075928</h3>Aerobic degradation of mercaptosuccinate by the gram-negative bacterium <span class="yellow">Variovorax paradoxus</span> strain B4. <br><br>The Gram-negative bacterium <span class="yellow">Variovorax paradoxus</span> strain B4 was isolated from soil under mesophilic and aerobic conditions to elucidate the so far unknown catabolism of mercaptosuccinate (MS). During growth with MS this strain released significant amounts of sulfate into the medium. Tn5::mob-induced mutagenesis was successfully employed and yielded nine independent mutants incapable of using MS as a carbon source. In six of these mutants, Tn5::mob insertions were mapped in a putative gene encoding a molybdenum (Mo) cofactor biosynthesis protein (moeA). In two further mutants the Tn5::mob insertion was mapped in the gene coding for a putative molybdopterin (MPT) oxidoreductase. In contrast to the wild type, these eight mutants also showed no growth on taurine. In another mutant a gene putatively encoding a 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme <span class="red">A</span> dehydrogenase (paaH2) was disrupted by transposon insertion. Upon subcellular fractionation of wild-type cells cultivated with MS as sole carbon and sulfur source, MPT oxidoreductase activity was detected in only the cytoplasmic fraction. Cells grown with succinate, taurine, or gluconate as a sole carbon source exhibited no activity or much lower activity. MPT oxidoreductase activity in the cytoplasmic fraction of the Tn5::mob-induced mutant Icr6 was 3-fold lower in comparison to the wild type. Therefore, a new pathway for MS catabolism in <span class="yellow">V. paradoxus</span> strain B4 is proposed: (i) MPT oxidoreductase catalyzes the conversion of MS first into sulfinosuccinate (a putative organo-sulfur compound composed of succinate and a sulfino group) and then into sulfosuccinate by successive transfer of oxygen atoms, (ii) sulfosuccinate is cleaved into oxaloacetate and sulfite, and (iii) sulfite is oxidized to sulfate. 
<h3>21148728</h3>Three motAB stator gene products in <span class="yellow">Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus</span> contribute to motility of a single flagellum during predatory and prey-independent growth. <br><br>The predatory bacterium <span class="yellow">Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus</span> uses flagellar motility to locate regions rich in Gram-negative prey bacteria, colliding and attaching to prey and then ceasing flagellar motility. Prey are then invaded to form a &quot;bdelloplast&quot; in a type IV pilus-dependent process, and prey contents are digested, allowing <span class="yellow">Bdellovibrio</span> growth and septation. After septation, <span class="yellow">Bdellovibrio</span> flagellar motility resumes inside the prey bdelloplast prior to its lysis and escape of <span class="yellow">Bdellovibrio</span> progeny. <span class="yellow">Bdellovibrio</span> can also grow slowly outside prey as long flagellate host-independent (HI) cells, cultured on peptone-rich media. The <span class="yellow">B. bacteriovorus HD100</span> genome encodes three pairs of MotAB flagellar motor proteins, each of which could potentially form an inner membrane ion channel, interact with the FliG flagellar rotor ring, and produce flagellar rotation. In 2004, Flannagan and coworkers (R. S. Flannagan, M. <span class="red">A</span>. Valvano, and S. F. Koval, Microbiology 150:649-656, 2004) used antisense RNA and green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression to downregulate a single <span class="yellow">Bdellovibrio</span> motA gene and reported slowed release from the bdelloplast and altered motility of the progeny. Here we inactivated each pair of motAB genes and found that each pair contributes to motility, both predatorily, inside the bdelloplast and during HI growth; however, each pair was dispensable, and deletion of no pair abolished motility totally. Driving-ion studies with phenamil, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), and different pH and sodium conditions indicated that all Mot pairs are proton driven, although the sequence similarities of each Mot pair suggests that some may originate from halophilic species. Thus, <span class="yellow">Bdellovibrio</span> is a &quot;dedicated motorist,&quot; retaining and expressing three pairs of mot genes. 
<h3>21183148</h3>Endotoxin removal devices for the treatment of sepsis and septic shock.<br><br>A substantial body of experimental and clinical evidence suggests that neutralising or removing lipopolysaccharide endotoxin would be an effective adjunctive approach to the management of Gram-negative sepsis. Polymyxins are a group of cyclic cationic polypeptide antibiotics. Although they have useful antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria, their clinical use has been limited because of toxicity. However, in addition to their antimicrobial property, polymyxins can bind to and neutralise endotoxin. Thus, investigators have explored the possibility of using polymyxin bound to a solid-phase carrier for specific haem-adsorption in patients with sepsis, thereby retaining the lipopolysaccharide-binding properties but minimising systemic toxic effects. This system has been widely used in Japan for many years, but convincing clinical evidence of efficacy is lacking. <span class="red">A</span> recent Italian study has some promising data. Although polymyxin has been the principal agent used to explore this approach, other molecules have the ability to bind endotoxin, and some of these have very recently been proposed as the basis for other endotoxin-removal devices. The available evidence is reviewed to assess the potential use of such devices in clinical practice. 
<h3>21281729</h3>A mutation in the Cc.ubc2 gene affects clamp cell morphogenesis as well as nuclear migration for dikaryosis in <span class="yellow">Coprinopsis cinerea</span>. <br><br>The formation and proliferation of the dikaryon in the agaricomycete <span class="yellow">Coprinopsis cinerea</span> is controlled by the mating type genes, <span class="red">A</span> and B. The B genes, which encode pheromones and pheromone receptors, control nuclear migration for dikaryosis as well as the fusion of the clamp cell with the subterminal cell while the <span class="red">A</span> genes, which encode two classes of homeodomain proteins, control conjugate nuclear division associated with clamp connection development. We characterized the mutant, B28, which was newly isolated as a strain that fails to form a primary hyphal knot, the first visible sign toward fruiting, from a homokaryotic fruiting strain after REMI mutagenesis. Detailed phenotypic analysis revealed that strain B28 exhibits, in addition to the fruiting defect, a defect in A-regulated clamp cell morphogenesis as well as a defect in B-regulated nuclear migration for dikaryosis. The mutant clamp cells are unique in that they continue growing like branches without fusing with the subterminal cells, in contrast to the unfused pseudoclamp which are normally formed in A-on B-off strains, providing evidence for the existence of an as yet unidentified mechanism for the growth suppression of the clamp cell. Molecular analysis revealed that the gene responsible for the phenotypes, designated Cc.ubc2, encodes a protein similar to Ubc2, an adaptor protein for filamentous growth, pheromone response and virulence in the smut fungus <span class="yellow">Ustilago maydis</span>. In addition, western blot analysis demonstrated that the Cc.ubc2-1 mutation blocks phosphorylation of a presumptive MAP kinase. 
<h3>22001288</h3>Modulation of <span class="yellow">fungal</span> sensitivity to staurosporine by targeting proteins identified by transcriptional profiling. <br><br>An analysis of the time-dependent genetic response to the death-inducer staurosporine was performed in <span class="yellow">Neurospora crassa</span> by transcriptional profiling. Staurosporine induced two major genes encoding an ABC transporter and a protein with similarity to regulatory subunits of potassium channels. The transcriptional response is dependent on the activity of a novel transcription factor. Deletion mutants in differentially expressed genes displayed altered sensitivity to staurosporine, underscoring significant proteins involved in the response to the drug. <span class="red">A</span> null-mutant of the ABC transporter (abc3) is extremely sensitive to staurosporine, accumulates more staurosporine than the wild type strain and is defective in energy-dependent export of the drug, indicating that the ABC3 protein is the first described staurosporine transporter. It was located in the plasma membrane by immunofluorescence microscopy. The combination of inhibitors of ABC transporters or of potassium channels with staurosporine leads to an enhanced activity against <span class="yellow">N. crassa</span> and pathogenic fungi paving the way to the development of more potent and specific antifungals. Our results highlight the general use of transcriptional profiling for the identification of novel proteins involved in cell death and their potential use as drug targets.
