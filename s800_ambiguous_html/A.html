</br>
Using phospholipases <b>A</b> ( 2 ) - specific spectrophotometric assays , it was shown that SB__A SI__. SI__castellanii lysates and their conditioned medium exhibit phospholipase activities . 
</br>
Sensitivity to phosphonoacetate and dideoxyTTP was examined in POPs ( TetPOP and CmPOP ) or POP - containing organelles ( chloroplasts of SB__Arabidopsis ) and other polymerases ( DNA polymerase I and mitochondria of SB__rat liver , which contain Polgamma ) , and the results suggest that high sensitivity to phosphonoacetate is unique to POPs in Family - <b>A</b> DNA polymerases . 
</br>
Furthermore , we observed a functional divergence between JEC21 SNF1 and its equivalent from serotype <b>A</b> strain SB__H99 . 
</br>
* <b>A</b> positive correlation was found between ionic effect and vessel grouping parameters , especially the portion of vessel walls in contact with neighbouring vessels . 
</br>
Transmembrane helix 2 ( TM2 ) of the Tar chemoreceptor undergoes an inward piston - like displacement of 1 to 3 <b>A</b> upon binding aspartate . 
</br>
Transcriptome profiling revealed a trichome - specific fatty acyl - coenzyme <b>A</b> reductase , trichome - specific fatty acyl - CoA reductase 1 ( TFAR1 ) , the expression of which correlates with trichome development and sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis . 
</br>
Correlation among parameters under the different water treatments suggested that potential improvements in the intrinsic water - use efficiency ( <b>A</b> ( N ) / g ( s ) ) are possible without negative impacts on yield . 
</br>
Under WS TR accessions displayed higher <b>A</b> ( N ) / g ( s ) , which was not due to differences in Rubisco - related parameters , but correlated with the ratio between the leaf mesophyll and stomatal conductances ( g ( m ) / g ( s ) ) . 
</br>
The results confirm the existence of differential traits in the response to drought stress in Mediterranean accessions of SB__tomato , and demonstrate that increases in the g ( m ) / g ( s ) ratio would allow improvements in <b>A</b> ( N ) / g ( s ) in horticultural crops . 
</br>
The ubiquitous marine Chlorophyte alga SB__Dunaliella SI__tertiolecta was tested under identical UV - B flux densities coupled with ecologically realistic fluxes of UV - <b>A</b> and visible radiation for 6 and 12 h exposures . 
</br>
Here , we examine how the vulnerability of xylem to water stress - induced cavitation and the coordination between water transport capacity and assimilation ( <b>A</b> ) influences diurnal water - use efficiency ( WUE ) and dry - matter production in SB__Lolium SI__perenne L . 
</br>
Instantaneous <b>A</b> remained maximal until & gt ; 70 % of hydraulic conductivity had been lost . 
</br>
* <b>A</b> PCR - based approach was initially employed to screen truffles for the presence of the MAT1 - 2 - 1 gene and amplify the conserved regions flanking the mating type ( MAT ) locus . 
</br>
* <b>A</b> greater understanding of the reproductive mechanisms that exist in Tuber spp . allows for optimization of truffle plantation management strategies . 
</br>
By studying stable cell lines , we found that F141L - LHBs could induce cell cycle progression by downregulating the p53 and p21 pathways and upregulating CDK4 and cyclin <b>A</b> . 
</br>
Regulation and function of SB__Escherichia SI__coli sugar efflux transporter <b>A</b> ( SetA ) during glucose - phosphate stress . 
</br>
To visualize RNA exiting , we have now determined asymmetric reconstructions from that subset , using both single - particle cryo - electron microscopy and cryo - electron tomographic methods , producing independent reconstructions at - 50 - <b>A</b> resolution . 
</br>
Contrary to predictions in the literature , the footprint of RNA on the capsid surface is located close to a viral 2 - fold axis , covering a slot - shaped area of reduced density that is present in both of the symmetrized 80S reconstructions and which extends by about 20 <b>A</b> away from the 2 - fold axis toward each neighboring 5 - fold axis . 
</br>
Although one prototypical Rfv3 susceptible SB__mouse strain , <b>A</b> / WySn , indeed contains a dysfunctional BAFF - R , two other Rfv3 susceptible strains , BALB / c and <b>A</b> . BY , express functional BAFF - R genes , determined on the basis of genotyping and B - cell immunophenotyping . 
</br>
Furthermore , transcomplementation studies in ( C57BL / 6 [ B6 ] x BALB / c ) F ( 1 ) and ( B6 x <b>A</b> . BY ) F ( 1 ) SB__mice revealed that the B6 Apobec3 gene significantly influences recovery from SB__FV viremia , cellular infection , and disease at 28 dpi . 
</br>
Finally , the Rfv3 phenotypes of prototypic B6 , <b>A</b> . BY , <b>A</b> / WySn , and BALB / c SB__mouse strains correlate with reported Apobec3 mRNA expression levels . 
</br>
T - cell cross - reactivity between SB__HCV and influenza virus - specific epitopes has been associated with rapid progression of SB__HCV disease ( S . Urbani , B . Amadei , P . Fisicaro , M . Pilli , G . Missale , <b>A</b> . Bertoletti , and C . Ferrari , J . Exp . Med . 201 : 675 - 680 , 2005 ) . 
</br>
We measured IFN - alpha , IFN - Beta , myxovirus resistance protein <b>A</b> ( MxA ) , SB__human TRIM5alpha ( huTRIM5alpha ) , and TRIM22 mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) of high - risk , SB__HIV SI__- SI__1 - uninfected participants and SB__HIV SI__- SI__1 - positive study participants . 
</br>
In India , there has been co - circulation , extinction and emergence of genotypes / lineages within serotype <b>A</b> foot - and - mouth disease ( SB__FMD ) virus . 
</br>
Total ascitic fluid IgG purified by Protein - <b>A</b> chromatography reacted with SB__HCV proteins in immunoblots , cell extracts , and replicon - expressing cells . 
</br>
Catabolite control protein <b>A</b> controls hydrogen peroxide production and cell death in SB__Streptococcus SI__sanguinis . 
</br>
To further investigate the regulation of spx gene expression , we assessed the role of catabolite control protein <b>A</b> ( CcpA ) in spx expression control . 
</br>
* <b>A</b> SB__rice mutant , SB__Oryza SI__sativa SI__short SI__postembryonic SI__roots SI__1 ( SB__Osspr1 ) , has been characterized . 
</br>
* <b>A</b> subset of transcripts coding for trehalose , glyoxylate and methylcitrate enzymes was up - regulated in fruiting bodies , whereas genes involved in mannitol and glycogen metabolism were preferentially expressed in mycelia and ectomycorrhizas , respectively . 
</br>
Interestingly , the native exoprotein OppA ( Ap ) was copurified with a hexapeptide ( EKFKIV ) showing both lysines methylated and possibly originating from an <b>A</b> . pernix endogenous stress - induced lipoprotein . 
</br>
Using the TTSS , SB__STEC is able to inject effector proteins directly into eukaryotic host cells , where they cause characteristic attaching and effacing ( <b>A</b> / E ) lesions . 
</br>
One of them , the non - LEE - encoded effector <b>A</b> ( NleA ) , is widely distributed among pathogenic SB__E SI__. SI__coli . 
</br>
Both cycles form succinyl - coenzyme <b>A</b> ( CoA ) from acetyl - CoA and two molecules of inorganic carbon , but they use different means . 
</br>
In this pathway , acetyl - coenzyme <b>A</b> ( CoA ) and succinyl - CoA are the only intermediates that can be considered common to the central carbon metabolism . 
</br>
As expected , concentrations of the yolk antioxidants vitamin <b>A</b> , vitamin E and carotenoids ( lutein and zeaxanthin ) were strongly positively intercorrelated . 
</br>
Influenza <b>A</b> H5N1 has had a profound effect on the poultry industry . 
</br>
Field observations demonstrated higher infection intensity in introduced trout than in SB__native SI__galaxias , but only small , immature <b>A</b> . galaxii were present in SB__trout . 
</br>
Experimental infections also demonstrated that <b>A</b> . galaxii does not mature in SB__trout , although parasite establishment and initial growth were similar in the two hosts . 
</br>
However , dynamic population modelling predicts that <b>A</b> . galaxii infections in native SB__galaxias should at most only be slightly reduced by dilution in the presence of SB__trout . 
</br>
We report that : ( 1 ) <b>A</b> SB__C SI__. SI__luttrellii transgenic strain carrying SB__C SI__. SI__heterostrophus MAT1 - 1 - 1 and a SB__C SI__. SI__luttrellii transgenic strain carrying SB__C SI__. SI__heterostrophus MAT1 - 2 - 1 can mate in a heterothallic manner and the fertility of the cross is similar to that of a wild type SB__C SI__. SI__luttrellii self . 
</br>
( 2 ) <b>A</b> SB__C SI__. SI__luttrellii transgenic strain carrying SB__C SI__. SI__heterostrophus MAT1 - 1 - 1 can mate with the parental wild type SB__C SI__. SI__luttrellii MAT1 - 1 ; MAT1 - 2 strain , indicating the latter is able to outcross , a result which was expected but has not been demonstrated previously . 
</br>
( 3 ) <b>A</b> SB__C SI__. SI__luttrellii transgenic strain carrying SB__C SI__. SI__heterostrophus MAT1 - 2 - 1 cannot mate with the parental wild type SB__C SI__. SI__luttrellii MAT1 - 1 ; MAT1 - 2 strain , indicating outcrossing specificity . 
</br>
Mutated USP reduces the stability of USP and all isoforms of the ecdysone receptor ( EcR ) and impairs nuclear localization and DNA binding of EcR / USP ( L259A / F491 / <b>A</b> ) , resulting in lower levels of basal transcriptional activity . 
</br>
Although the affinity of the ligand ponasterone <b>A</b> to EcR / USP ( L259 / F491 ) is moderately diminished , hormone - induced stimulation of transcriptional activity is normal . 
</br>
SB__S SI__. SI__litura VgR ( SlVgR ) comprised two ligand binding sites with four LDLR class <b>A</b> repeats in the first domain and seven in the second domain , an epidermal growth factor - like domain containing an LDLR class B repeat and a YWXD motif , a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain . 
</br>
Translational control of the abundance of cytoplasmic poly ( <b>A</b> ) binding protein in SB__human SI__cytomegalovirus - infected cells . 
</br>
However , only SB__HCMV replication is associated with an increased abundance of eIF4F core components ( eIF4E , eIF4G , eIF4A ) and the eIF4F - associated factor poly ( <b>A</b> ) binding protein ( PABP ) . 
</br>
In another mutant a gene putatively encoding a 3 - hydroxyacyl - coenzyme <b>A</b> dehydrogenase ( paaH2 ) was disrupted by transposon insertion . 
</br>
In 2004 , Flannagan and coworkers ( R . S . Flannagan , M . <b>A</b> . Valvano , and S . F . Koval , Microbiology 150 : 649 - 656 , 2004 ) used antisense RNA and green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) expression to downregulate a single SB__Bdellovibrio motA gene and reported slowed release from the bdelloplast and altered motility of the progeny . 
</br>
The formation and proliferation of the dikaryon in the agaricomycete SB__Coprinopsis SI__cinerea is controlled by the mating type genes , <b>A</b> and B . 
</br>
The B genes , which encode pheromones and pheromone receptors , control nuclear migration for dikaryosis as well as the fusion of the clamp cell with the subterminal cell while the <b>A</b> genes , which encode two classes of homeodomain proteins , control conjugate nuclear division associated with clamp connection development . 
</br>
Detailed phenotypic analysis revealed that strain B28 exhibits , in addition to the fruiting defect , a defect in <b>A</b> - regulated clamp cell morphogenesis as well as a defect in B - regulated nuclear migration for dikaryosis . 
</br>
The mutant clamp cells are unique in that they continue growing like branches without fusing with the subterminal cells , in contrast to the unfused pseudoclamp which are normally formed in <b>A</b> - on B - off strains , providing evidence for the existence of an as yet unidentified mechanism for the growth suppression of the clamp cell .

</br>
The rapid production of high - titer SB__porcine SI__endogenous SI__retrovirus ( PERV ) - B env pseudotype and construction of an EGFP - expressing replication competent PERV - <b>A</b> vector . 
</br>
This EGFP - expressing PERV - <b>A</b> - IRES - EGFP molecular clone was found to be stable genetically on transfection in 293 cells . 
</br>
The validation of a real - time RT - PCR assay which detects influenza <b>A</b> and types simultaneously for SB__influenza SI__A SI__H1N1 ( 2009 ) and oseltamivir - resistant ( H275Y ) influenza <b>A</b> H1N1 ( 2009 ) . 
</br>
Influenza <b>A</b> H1N1 ( 2009 ) was declared by the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) as the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century . 
</br>
Rapid detection of influenza <b>A</b> and differentiation of influenza <b>A</b> H1N1 ( 2009 ) and seasonal influenza <b>A</b> is beneficial . 
</br>
In addition the rapid detection of antiviral resistant strains of influenza <b>A</b> H1N1 ( 2009 ) would be useful for clinicians to allow for change to an effective treatment at a much earlier stage if resistance is found . 
</br>
Since most virology laboratories already offer a molecular service for influenza <b>A</b> this assay could easily be implemented into most areas at little cost therefore increasing local access to resistance testing . 
</br>
Reports suggesting that SB__HSV SI__- SI__1 US3 substrates overlap with those of cellular protein kinase <b>A</b> ( PKA ) prompted the use of an antibody specific for phosphorylated PKA substrates to identify US3 / ORF66 targets . 
</br>
PF74 antiviral activity was promoted by binding of the host protein cyclophilin <b>A</b> to the SB__HIV SI__- SI__1 capsid , and PF74 and cyclosporine exhibited mutual antagonism . 
</br>
Photosynthesis rate ( <b>A</b> ( n ) ) becomes unstable above a threshold temperature , and the recovery upon return to low temperature varies because of reasons not fully understood . 
</br>
We investigated responses of <b>A</b> ( n ) , dark respiration and chlorophyll fluorescence to supraoptimal temperatures of varying duration and kinetics in SB__Phaseolus SI__vulgaris asking whether the instability of photosynthesis under severe heat stress is associated with cellular damage . 
</br>
However , <b>A</b> ( n ) was strongly inhibited already before T ( F ) was reached . 
</br>
To elucidate the physiological functions of the RNAi pathway in SB__Cryptococcus SI__neoformans that causes fungal meningitis , here we performed genetic analyses for genes encoding Argonaute ( AGO1 and AGO2 ) , RNA - dependent RNA polymerase ( RDP1 ) , and Dicers ( DCR1 and DCR2 ) in both serotype <b>A</b> and D SB__C SI__. SI__neoformans . 
</br>
Comparative transcriptome analysis of the serotype <b>A</b> and D RNAi mutants revealed that only modest changes occur in the genome - wide transcriptome profiles when the RNAi process was perturbed . 
</br>
A caffeyl - coenzyme <b>A</b> synthetase initiates caffeate activation prior to caffeate reduction in the acetogenic bacterium SB__Acetobacterium SI__woodii . 
</br>
carA encodes a potential coenzyme <b>A</b> ( CoA ) transferase , carB an acyl - CoA synthetase , and carC an acyl - CoA dehydrogenase . 
</br>
SB__P SI__. SI__aeruginosa contains two different sugar chains , the homopolymer common antigen ( <b>A</b> band ) and the heteropolymer O antigen ( B band ) , which impart serospecificity . 
</br>
Effects of nitrogen ( N ) supply on the limiting step of CO ( 2 ) assimilation rate ( <b>A</b> ) at 380 mumol mol ( - 1 ) CO ( 2 ) concentration ( <b>A</b> ( 380 ) ) at several leaf temperatures were studied in several crops , since N nutrition alters N allocation between photosynthetic components . 
</br>
Large leaf N content was linked to a high stomatal ( g ( s ) ) and mesophyll conductance ( g ( m ) ) , but resulted in a lower intercellular ( C ( i ) ) and chloroplast CO ( 2 ) concentration ( C ( c ) ) because the increase in g ( s ) and g ( m ) was insufficient to compensate for change in <b>A</b> ( 380 ) . 
</br>
The <b>A</b> - C ( c ) response was used to estimate the maximum rate of RuBP carboxylation ( V ( cmax ) ) and chloroplast electron transport ( J ( max ) ) . 
</br>
Analysis using the C ( 3 ) photosynthesis model indicated that <b>A</b> ( 380 ) tended to be limited by RuBP carboxylation in plants grown at low N concentration , whereas it was limited by RuBP regeneration in plants grown at high N concentration . 
</br>
We conclude that the limiting step of <b>A</b> ( 380 ) depends on leaf N content and is mainly determined by N partitioning between Rubisco and electron transport components . 
</br>
SB__S SI__. SI__litura VgR ( SlVgR ) comprised two ligand binding sites with four LDLR class <b>A</b> repeats in the first domain and seven in the second domain , an epidermal growth factor - like domain containing an LDLR class B repeat and a YWXD motif , a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain . 
</br>
Translational control of the abundance of cytoplasmic poly ( <b>A</b> ) binding protein in SB__human SI__cytomegalovirus - infected cells .

However , only SB__HCMV replication is associated with an increased abundance of eIF4F core components ( eIF4E , eIF4G , eIF4A ) and the eIF4F - associated factor poly ( <b>A</b> ) binding protein ( PABP ) . 
</br>
In another mutant a gene putatively encoding a 3 - hydroxyacyl - coenzyme <b>A</b> dehydrogenase ( paaH2 ) was disrupted by transposon insertion . 
</br>
In 2004 , Flannagan and coworkers ( R . S . Flannagan , M . <b>A</b> . Valvano , and S . F . Koval , Microbiology 150 : 649 - 656 , 2004 ) used antisense RNA and green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) expression to downregulate a single SB__Bdellovibrio motA gene and reported slowed release from the bdelloplast and altered motility of the progeny . 
</br>
The formation and proliferation of the dikaryon in the agaricomycete SB__Coprinopsis SI__cinerea is controlled by the mating type genes , <b>A</b> and B . 
</br>
The B genes , which encode pheromones and pheromone receptors , control nuclear migration for dikaryosis as well as the fusion of the clamp cell with the subterminal cell while the <b>A</b> genes , which encode two classes of homeodomain proteins , control conjugate nuclear division associated with clamp connection development . 
</br>
Detailed phenotypic analysis revealed that strain B28 exhibits , in addition to the fruiting defect , a defect in <b>A</b> - regulated clamp cell morphogenesis as well as a defect in B - regulated nuclear migration for dikaryosis . 
</br>
The mutant clamp cells are unique in that they continue growing like branches without fusing with the subterminal cells , in contrast to the unfused pseudoclamp which are normally formed in <b>A</b> - on B - off strains , providing evidence for the existence of an as yet unidentified mechanism for the growth suppression of the clamp cell .
