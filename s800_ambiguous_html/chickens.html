The pandemic <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> (H1N1pdm) <span class="yellow">virus</span> is the predominant <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span> strain in the <span class="yellow">human</span> population. It has also crossed the species barriers and infected turkeys and <span class="yellow">swine</span> in several countries. Thus, the development of a vaccine that is effective in multiple animal species is urgently needed. We have previously demonstrated that the introduction of temperature-sensitive mutations into the PB2 and PB1 genes of an avian <span class="yellow">H9N2 virus</span>, combined with the insertion of a hemagglutinin (HA) tag in PB1, resulted in an attenuated (att) vaccine backbone for both <span class="blue">chickens</span> and <span class="yellow">mice</span>. Because the new pandemic strain is a triple-reassortant (TR) <span class="yellow">virus</span>, we chose to introduce the double attenuating modifications into a <span class="yellow">swine</span>-like TR <span class="yellow">virus</span> isolate, <span class="yellow">A/turkey/OH/313053/04 (H3N2)</span> (ty/04), with the goal of producing live attenuated <span class="yellow">influenza</span> vaccines (LAIV). This genetically modified backbone had impaired polymerase activity and restricted <span class="yellow">virus</span> growth at elevated temperatures. In vivo characterization of two <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> vaccine candidates generated using the ty/04 att backbone demonstrated that this vaccine is highly attenuated in <span class="yellow">mice</span>, as indicated by the absence of signs of disease, limited replication, and minimum histopathological alterations in the respiratory tract. <span class="yellow">A</span> single immunization with the ty/04 att-based vaccines conferred complete protection against a lethal <span class="yellow">H1N1pdm</span><span class="yellow">H1N1pdm virus</span> infection in <span class="yellow">mice</span>. More importantly, vaccination of <span class="yellow">pigs</span> with a ty/04 att-H1N1 vaccine candidate resulted in sterilizing immunity upon an aggressive intratracheal challenge with the 2009 <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> pandemic <span class="yellow">virus</span>. Our studies highlight the safety of the ty/04 att vaccine platform and its potential as a master donor strain for the generation of live attenuated vaccines for <span class="yellow">humans</span> and livestock. 
<h3>20962090</h3><span class="yellow">Marek's disease virus type 1</span> microRNA miR-M3 suppresses cisplatin-induced apoptosis by targeting Smad2 of the transforming growth factor beta signal pathway. <br><br>Viruses cause about 15% of the cancers that are still the leading causes of <span class="yellow">human</span> mortality. The discovery of <span class="yellow">viral</span> oncogenes has enhanced our understanding of <span class="yellow">viral</span> oncogenesis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of virus-induced cancers are complex and require further investigation. The present study has attempted to investigate the effects of the microRNAs (miRNAs) encoded by <span class="yellow">Marek's disease virus 1</span> (<span class="yellow">MDV1</span>), a <span class="yellow">chicken</span> herpesvirus causing acute T-cell lymphomas and solid visceral tumors in <span class="blue">chickens</span>, on anti-cancer drug-induced apoptosis and identify the targets of the miRNAs. The results showed that of the total 14 miRNAs encoded by <span class="yellow">MDV1</span>, <span class="yellow">MDV1</span>-miR-M3 significantly promoted cell survival under treatment with cisplatin, a widely used chemotherapy drug. <span class="yellow">MDV1</span>-miR-M3 suppressed cisplatin-induced apoptosis by directly downregulating expression at the protein but not the mRNA level of Smad2, a critical component in the transforming growth factor Beta signal pathway. Our data suggest that latent/oncogenic viruses may encode miRNAs to directly target cellular factors involved in antiviral processes including apoptosis, thus proactively creating a cellular environment beneficial to <span class="yellow">viral</span> latency and oncogenesis. Furthermore, the knowledge of the apoptosis resistance conferred by <span class="yellow">viral</span> miRNAs has great practical implications for improving the efficacy of chemotherapies for treating cancers, especially those induced by oncogenic viruses. 
<h3>22182611</h3>Laboratory and Field Evaluation of Formulated <span class="yellow">Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis</span> as a Feed Additive and Using Topical Applications for Control of <span class="yellow">Musca domestica</span> (Diptera: Muscidae) Larvae in Caged-Poultry Manure. <br><br>Infestations of <span class="yellow">house flies</span>, <span class="yellow">Musca domestica</span> L., are a continual problem around <span class="yellow">poultry</span> establishments. Acute toxicity of two commercial <span class="yellow">Bacillus thuringiensis variety israelensis</span> (<span class="yellow">Bti</span>) formulations (water-dispersible granules and bran formulation) was evaluated against larvae in the laboratory and against natural populations of <span class="yellow">M. domestica</span> larvae in the field applied in feed to <span class="blue">chickens</span> and as topical applications in the <span class="yellow">poultry</span> houses. Bioassay data showed that susceptibility of <span class="yellow">M. domestica</span> larvae increased to a given concentration of <span class="yellow">Bti</span> as the duration of exposure increased. In the laboratory studies, the LC(50) values of <span class="yellow">Bti</span> for the larvae ranged between 65 and 77.4 mug/ml. In the field, a concentration of 10 g <span class="yellow">Bti</span>/kg of feed resulted in 90% reduction of larvae at 4 wk after treatment. <span class="yellow">A</span> higher concentration (2 g/liter) of <span class="yellow">Bti</span> in spray applications was not significantly more effective than the lower concentration of 1 g/liter. Adding <span class="yellow">Bti</span> to <span class="yellow">chicken</span> feed is potentially an efficient measure for the management and control of <span class="yellow">house flies</span> in caged-poultry facilities.
