<h2>fire ants</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21526930</h3>Fire ant decapitating fly cooperative release programs (1994-2008): two Pseudacteon species, <span class="yellow">P. tricuspis</span> and <span class="yellow">P. curvatus</span>, rapidly expand across imported <span class="yellow">fire ant</span> populations in the southeastern United States. <br><br>Natural enemies of the imported <span class="red">fire ants</span>, <span class="yellow">Solenopsis invicta Buren</span> <span class="yellow">S. richteri Forel</span> (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), and their hybrid, include a suite of more than 20 <span class="yellow">fire ant</span> decapitating phorid flies from South America in the genus Pseudacteon. Over the past 12 years, many researchers and associates have cooperated in introducing several species as classical or self-sustaining biological control agents in the United States. As a result, two species of flies, <span class="yellow">Pseudacteon tricuspis Borgmeier</span> and <span class="yellow">P. curvatus Borgmeier</span> (Diptera: Phoridae), are well established across large areas of the southeastern United States. Whereas many researchers have published local and state information about the establishment and spread of these flies, here distribution data from both published and unpublished sources has been compiled for the entire United States with the goal of presenting confirmed and probable distributions as of the fall of 2008. Documented rates of expansion were also used to predict the distribution of these flies three years later in the fall of 2011. In the fall of 2008, eleven years after the first successful release, we estimate that <span class="yellow">P. tricuspis</span> covered about 50% of the <span class="yellow">fire ant</span> quarantined area and that it will occur in almost 65% of the quarantine area by 2011. Complete coverage of the <span class="yellow">fire ant</span> quarantined area will be delayed or limited by this species' slow rate of spread and frequent failure to establish in more northerly portions of the <span class="yellow">fire ant</span> range and also, perhaps, by its preference for <span class="yellow">red imported fire ants</span> (<span class="yellow">S. invicta</span>). Eight years after the first successful release of <span class="yellow">P. curvatus</span>, two biotypes of this species (one biotype occurring predominantly in the <span class="yellow">black</span> and hybrid imported <span class="red">fire ants</span> and the other occurring in <span class="yellow">red imported fire ants</span>) covered almost 60% of the <span class="yellow">fire ant</span> quarantined area. We estimate these two biotypes will cover almost 90% of the quarantine area by 2011 and 100% by 2012 or 2013. Strategic selection of several distributional gaps for future releases will accelerate complete coverage of quarantine areas. However, some gaps may be best used for the release of additional species of decapitating flies because establishment rates may be higher in areas without competing species. 
<h3>21529150</h3>The organization of foraging in the <span class="yellow">fire ant</span>, <span class="yellow">Solenopsis invicta</span>. <br><br>Although natural selection in ants acts most strongly at the colony, or superorganismal level, foraging patterns have rarely been studied at that level, focusing instead on the behavior of individual foragers or groups of foragers. The experiments and observations in this paper reveal in broad strokes how colonies of the <span class="yellow">fire ant</span>, <span class="yellow">Solenopsis invicta</span><span class="yellow">Solenopsis invicta Buren</span> (<span class="yellow">Hymenoptera</span>: Formicidae), allocate their available labor to foraging, how they disperse that force within their territory, and how this force changes with colony size, season and worker age. Territory area is positively related to colony size and the number of foragers, more so during the spring than fall. Changes of colony size and territory area are driven by seasonal variation of sexual and worker production, which in turn drive seasonal variation of worker age-distribution. During spring sexual production, colonies shrink because worker production falls below replacement. This loss is proportional to colony size, causing forager density in the spring to be negatively related to colony and territory size. In the fall, colonies emphasize worker production, bringing colony size back up. However, because smaller colonies curtailed spring worker production less than larger ones, their fall forager populations are proportionally greater, causing them to gain territory at the expense of large colonies. Much variation of territory area remains unexplained and can probably be attributed to pressure from neighboring colonies. Boundaries between territories are characterized by &quot;no ants' zones&quot; mostly devoid of <span class="red">fire ants</span>. The forager population can be divided into a younger group of recruitable workers that wait for scouts to activate them to help retrieve large food finds. About one-third of the recruits wait near openings in the foraging tunnels that underlie the entire territory, while two-thirds wait in the nest. Recruitment to food is initially very rapid and local from the foraging tunnels, while sustained recruitment gradually involves the recruits waiting in the nest. As recruits age, they become scouts searching for food on the surface, and die about two weeks later. Foraging tunnels decrease in cross-sectional area with distance from the nest, in keeping with the gradual bleeding off of workers to the surface with distance. Foragers lack route-faithfulness, and having been marked and released at one point within the territory, they can be recaptured at any other point a day later. The size of the territory actually occupied may be limited during dry weather, resulting in very large no-ants' zones. 
<h3>21797944</h3>Insect insulin receptors: insights from sequence and caste expression analyses of two cloned hymenopteran insulin receptor cDNAs from the <span class="yellow">fire ant</span>. <br><br>The insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signalling (IIS) pathway in the <span class="yellow">honey bee</span> (<span class="yellow">Apis mellifera</span>) is linked to reproductive division of labour and foraging behaviour. Two insulin receptor genes are present in the released genomes of other social hymenopterans. Limited information is available on the IIS pathway role in ants. The predicted insulin receptor sequences from the recently released draft genome of the <span class="yellow">fire ant</span> <span class="yellow">Solenopsis invicta</span> (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) are incomplete and biologically significant data are also lacking. To elucidate the role of the IIS pathway in the <span class="yellow">fire ant</span>, two putative insulin receptors (SiInR-1 and SiInR-2) were cloned; the first InR cDNAs cloned from social insects. Analyses of putative post-translational modification sites in SiInRs revealed the potential for differential regulation. We investigated the transcriptional expression of both receptors at different developmental stages, castes and queen tissues. In last instar larvae and pharate pupae of workers and reproductive, transcriptional abundance of both receptors was negatively correlated with body size and nutritional status. The expression level of both receptors in different queen tissues appears to correlate with requirements for queen reproductive physiology and behaviours. This study contributes new information to the understanding of social insects because in <span class="blue">fire ants</span> juvenile hormone acts as a gonadotropin and workers are fully sterile, contrary to <span class="yellow">honey bees</span>.
