<h2>corn</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20887797</h3>The FvMK1 mitogen-activated protein kinase gene regulates conidiation, pathogenesis, and fumonisin production in <span class="annotated ">Fusarium verticillioides</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Fusarium verticillioides</span> is one of the most important <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> pathogens to cause destructive diseases of <span class="annotated ">maize</span> worldwide. Fumonisins produced by the fungus are harmful to <span class="annotated ">human</span> and animal health. To date, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with pathogenicity and fumonisin biosynthesis in <span class="annotated ">F. verticillioides</span> is limited. Because MAP kinase pathways have been implicated in regulating diverse processes important for plant infection in phytopathogenic fungi, in this study we identified and functionally characterized the FvMK1 gene in <span class="annotated ">F. verticillioides</span>. FvMK1 is orthologous to FMK1 in <span class="annotated ">F. oxysporum</span> and GPMK1 in <span class="annotated ">F. graminearum</span>. The Fvmk1 deletion mutant was reduced in vegetative growth and production of microconidia. However, it was normal in sexual reproduction and increased in the production of macroconidia. In infection assays with developing <span class="match annotated ">corn</span> kernels, the Fvmk1 mutant was non-pathogenic and failed to colonize through wounding sites. It also failed to cause stalk rot symptoms beyond the inoculation sites on <span class="match annotated ">corn</span> stalks, indicating that FvMK1 is essential for plant infection. Furthermore, the Fvmk1 mutant was significantly reduced in fumonisin production and expression levels of FUM1 and FUM8, two genes involved in fumonisin biosynthesis. The defects of the Fvmk1 mutant were fully complemented by re-introducing the wild type FvMK1 allele. These results demonstrate that FvMK1 plays critical roles in the regulation of vegetative growth, asexual reproduction, fumonisin biosynthesis, and pathogenicity. 
<h3>21039559</h3>Systemic virus-induced gene silencing allows functional characterization of <span class="annotated ">maize</span> genes during biotrophic interaction with <span class="annotated ">Ustilago maydis</span>. <br><br>Infection of <span class="annotated ">maize</span> (<span class="annotated ">Zea mays</span>) plants with the <span class="match annotated ">corn</span><span class="unannotated ">corn smut</span> fungus <span class="annotated ">Ustilago maydis</span> leads to the formation of large tumors on the stem, leaves and inflorescences. In this biotrophic interaction, plant defense responses are actively suppressed by the pathogen, and previous transcriptome analyses of infected <span class="annotated ">maize</span> plants showed massive and stage-specific changes in host gene expression during disease progression. To identify <span class="annotated ">maize</span> genes that are functionally involved in the interaction with <span class="annotated ">U. maydis</span>, we adapted a virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) system based on the brome mosaic <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> (BMV) for <span class="annotated ">maize</span>. Conditions were established that allowed successful <span class="annotated ">U. maydis</span> infection of BMV-preinfected <span class="unannotated ">maize</span> plants. This set-up enabled quantification of VIGS and its impact on <span class="annotated ">U. maydis</span> infection using a quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)-based readout. In proof-of-principle experiments, an <span class="annotated ">U. maydis</span>-induced terpene synthase was shown to negatively regulate disease development while a protein involved in cell death inhibition was required for full virulence of <span class="unannotated ">U. maydis</span>. The results suggest that this system is a versatile tool for the rapid identification of <span class="annotated ">maize</span> genes that determine compatibility with <span class="annotated ">U. maydis</span>. 
<h3>21526935</h3>Assessment of attractiveness of <span class="annotated ">cassava</span> as a roosting plant for the <span class="annotated ">melon fly</span>, <span class="annotated ">Bactrocera cucurbitae</span>, and the <span class="annotated ">Oriental fruit fly</span>, <span class="annotated ">B. dorsalis</span>. <br><br>Application of bait spray to crop borders is a standard approach for suppression of <span class="annotated ">melon fly</span>, <span class="annotated ">Bactrocera cucurbitae</span> (Coquillett) (Diptera: Tephritidae) populations and may also be of value for suppression of <span class="annotated ">oriental fruit fly</span>, <span class="annotated ">B. dorsalis</span> (Hendel) populations. Establishment of preferred roosting hosts as crop borders may help to improve suppression of both fruit <span class="linneaus_only ">fly</span> species by providing sites for bait spray applications. In an area-wide <span class="annotated ">B. cucurbitae</span> suppression trial, the question was raised as to whether <span class="annotated ">cassava</span>, <span class="annotated ">Manihot esculenta</span> Crantz (Euphorbiales: Euphorbiaceae), could be used as a <span class="annotated ">B. cucurbitae</span> roosting host. <span class="annotated ">M. esculenta</span> was of interest as a roosting host because, in contrast to many other identified preferred roosting hosts, it would also be a crop potentially increasing the productivity of the crop production system overall. As a short-lived and shrubby perennial, <span class="annotated ">M. esculenta</span> potentially constitutes a crop with more persistent roosting foliage than an annual crop such as <span class="match annotated ">corn</span>, <span class="annotated ">Zea mays</span> L. (Cyperales: Poaceae), that has often been planted as a roosting host for <span class="annotated ">B. cucurbitae</span> control. Using protein-baited traps set amidst potted plants placed adjacent to a <span class="annotated ">papaya</span> <span class="annotated ">Carica papaya</span> L. (Violales: Caricaceae) orchard known to have established populations of <span class="annotated ">B. cucurbitae</span> and <span class="annotated ">B. dorsalis</span>, the effectiveness of <span class="annotated ">M. esculenta</span> as a roosting host was assessed by comparing its attractiveness to that of <span class="annotated ">castor bean</span>, <span class="annotated ">Ricinus communis</span> L (Malpighiales: Euphorbiaceae), previously identified as one of the most attractive roosting hosts for <span class="annotated ">B. cucurbitae</span>, and to <span class="match annotated ">corn</span>, a crop which has been planted as a roosting host for help in <span class="annotated ">B. cucurbitae</span> control. The results showed that use of <span class="annotated ">M. esculenta</span> as a roosting host is comparable to use of <span class="annotated ">R. communis</span> by both <span class="annotated ">B. cucurbitae</span> and <span class="annotated ">B. dorsalis</span>. These results provide encouragement to incorporate <span class="annotated ">M. esculenta</span> on a farm as a trap crop (i.e. site for bait spray application). This has the advantage of having the trap crop be a crop on its own (as opposed to <span class="annotated ">castor bean</span>) and, among prospective crops that could be used as a trap crop, has foliage more persistent than an annual trap crop such as <span class="match annotated ">corn</span>. 
<h3>21529147</h3>Growth inhibition of <span class="annotated ">Beauveria bassiana</span> by bacteria isolated from the cuticular surface of the <span class="annotated ">corn leafhopper</span>, <span class="annotated ">Dalbulus maidis</span> and the planthopper, <span class="annotated ">Delphacodes kuscheli</span>, two important vectors of <span class="unannotated ">maize</span> pathogens. <br><br>The phytosanitary importance of the <span class="match annotated ">corn</span><span class="unannotated ">corn leafhopper</span>, <span class="unannotated ">Dalbulus maidis</span> (De Long and Wolcott) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) and the planthopper, <span class="unannotated ">Delphacodes kuscheli</span> Fennah (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) lies in their ability to transmit phloem-associated plant pathogens, mainly viruses and mollicutes, and to cause considerable mechanical damage to <span class="match unannotated ">corn</span> plants during feeding and oviposition. Fungi, particularly some members of the Ascomycota, are likely candidates for biocontrol agents against these insect pests, but several studies revealed their failure to invade the insect cuticle possibly because of the presence of inhibitory compounds such as phenols, quinones, and lipids and also by the antibiosis effect of the microbiota living on the cuticular surface of the host. The present work aims to understand interactions between the entomopathogenic fungus <span class="annotated ">Beauveria bassiana</span> (Balsamao-Crivelli) Vuillemin (Hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae) and bacterial antagonists isolated from the cuticular surface of <span class="annotated ">D. maidis</span> and <span class="annotated ">D. kuscheli</span>. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> total of 155 bacterial isolates were recovered from the insect's cuticle and tested against <span class="annotated ">B. bassiana</span>. Ninety-one out of 155 strains inhibited the growth of <span class="annotated ">B. bassiana</span>. Bacterial strains isolated from <span class="annotated ">D. maidis</span> were significantly more antagonistic against <span class="annotated ">B. bassiana</span> than those isolates from <span class="annotated ">D. kuscheli</span>. Among the most effective antagonistic strains, six isolates of <span class="annotated ">Bacillus thuringiensis</span> Berliner (Bacillales: Bacillaeae (after <span class="annotated ">B. subtilis</span>)), one isolate of <span class="annotated ">B. mycoides</span> Flugge, eight isolates of <span class="annotated ">B. megaterium</span> de Bary, five isolates of <span class="annotated ">B.pumilus</span> Meyer and Gottheil, one isolate of <span class="annotated ">B. licheniformis</span> (Weigmann) Chester, and four isolates of <span class="annotated ">B. subtilis</span> (Ehrenberg) Cohn were identified.
