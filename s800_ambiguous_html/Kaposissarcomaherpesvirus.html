<h2>Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20980505</h3>Translational control of the abundance of cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein in <span class="yellow">human cytomegalovirus</span>-infected cells. <br><br>Irrespective of their effects on ongoing host protein synthesis, productive replication of the representative alphaherpesvirus <span class="yellow">herpes simplex virus type 1</span>, the representative gammaherpesvirus <span class="blue">Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus</span>, and the representative betaherpesvirus <span class="yellow">human cytomegalovirus</span> [<span class="yellow">HCMV</span>] stimulates the assembly of the multisubunit, cap-binding translation factor eIF4F. However, only <span class="yellow">HCMV</span> replication is associated with an increased abundance of eIF4F core components (eIF4E, eIF4G, eIF4A) and the eIF4F-associated factor poly(A) binding protein (PABP). Here, we demonstrate that the increase in translation factor concentration was readily detected in an asynchronous population of <span class="yellow">HCMV</span>-infected primary <span class="yellow">human</span> fibroblasts, abolished by prior UV inactivation of <span class="yellow">virus</span>, and genetically dependent upon <span class="yellow">viral</span> immediate-early genes. Strikingly, while increased mRNA steady-state levels accompanied the rise in eIF4E and eIF4G protein levels, the overall abundance of PABP mRNA, together with the half-life of the polypeptide it encodes, remained relatively unchanged by <span class="yellow">HCMV</span> infection. Instead, <span class="yellow">HCMV</span>-induced PABP accumulation resulted from new protein synthesis and was sensitive to the mTORC1-selective inhibitor rapamycin, which interferes with phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrate p70 S6K and the translational repressor 4E-BP1. While virus-induced PABP accumulation did not require p70 S6K, it was inhibited by the expression of a dominant-acting 4E-BP1 variant unable to be inactivated by mTORC1. Finally, unlike the situation in alpha- or gammaherpesvirus-infected cells, where PABP is redistributed to nuclei, PABP accumulated in the cytoplasm of <span class="yellow">HCMV</span>-infected cells. Thus, cytoplasmic PABP accumulation is translationally controlled in <span class="yellow">HCMV</span>-infected cells via a mechanism requiring mTORC1-mediated inhibition of the cellular 4E-BP1 translational repressor.
