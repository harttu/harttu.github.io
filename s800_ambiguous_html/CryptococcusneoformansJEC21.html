<h2>Cryptococcus neoformans JEC21</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20719250</h3>Regulation of virulence factors, carbon utilization and virulence by SNF1 in <span class="blue">Cryptococcus neoformans JEC21</span> and divergent actions of SNF1 between cryptococcal strains. 

We describe here the functions of a Snf1/AMPK homolog in the <span class="yellow">human</span> pathogenic <span class="yellow">yeast</span> <span class="yellow">Cryptococcus neoformans</span>, strain <span class="yellow">JEC21</span>. We found that <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1 is a key regulator for the biosynthesis of the major virulence factors, stress resistance and alternative carbon source utilization. Disruption of <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1 results in defects of laccase activity and capsule production, sensitivity to cation stress. Especially, we found that <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1 is essential for growth at elevated temperature and for thermotolerance. To our knowledge, a role for Snf1 proteins in thermotolerance has not been reported. Furthermore, we observed a functional divergence between <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1 and its equivalent from <span class="yellow">serotype A</span><span class="yellow">A</span> strain <span class="yellow">H99</span>. <span class="yellow">A</span> high temperature is needed for <span class="yellow">H99</span> SNF1 to function in stress response and carbon source preference, but not for the <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1. Our results confirmed a critical role of <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1 in regulation of stress response and virulence. Revelation of divergent actions of SNF1 may help to understand the evolution of cryptococcal pathogenesis and provides insights into the strain-associated biosynthesis of virulence factors.
