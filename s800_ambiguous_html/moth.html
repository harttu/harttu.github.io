<h2>moth</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21091811</h3>Candidate chemosensory ionotropic receptors in a Lepidoptera.<br><br>A new family of candidate chemosensory ionotropic receptors (IRs) related to ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) was recently discovered in <span class="annotated ">Drosophila melanogaster</span>. Through Blast analyses of an expressed sequenced tag library prepared from male antennae of the noctuid <span class="match linneaus_only ">moth</span> <span class="annotated ">Spodoptera littoralis</span>, we identified 12 unigenes encoding proteins related to <span class="annotated ">D. melanogaster</span> and <span class="annotated ">Bombyx mori</span> IRs. Their full length sequences were obtained and the analyses of their expression patterns suggest that they were exclusively expressed or clearly enriched in chemosensory organs. The deduced protein sequences were more similar to <span class="annotated ">B. mori</span> and <span class="annotated ">D. melanogaster</span> IRs than to iGluRs and showed considerable variations in the predicted ligand-binding domains; none have the three glutamate-interacting residues found in iGluRs, suggesting different binding specificities. Our data suggest that we identified members of the insect IR chemosensory receptor family in <span class="annotated ">S. littoralis</span> and we report here the first demonstration of IR expression in Lepidoptera. 
<h3>21188839</h3>Breathing some air into the single-species vacuum: multi-species responses to environmental change. <br><br>Studies of ecological responses to climate change have often analysed species independently of each other, yet interactions between species are fundamental aspects of ecology. Mutshinda, O'Hara &amp; Woiwod (2011) used light-trapping data for Lepidoptera (moths) to examine population responses to intraspecific effects and effects of winter rainfall and temperature. They show how Bayesian hierarchical models can analyse residual correlations among species' responses, illustrating an approach to account for and measure dependencies that are not fully explained by the candidate explanatory variables. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> key result is that the responses of the different <span class="match linneaus_only ">moth</span> species did not appear to have strong residual correlation (Mutshinda, O'Hara &amp; Woiwod 2011). These analyses provide an approach for synthesising across species and can better inform ecological responses to environmental change. 
<h3>21199020</h3>Genetic analysis of the xenobiotic resistance-associated ABC gene subfamilies of the Lepidoptera. <br><br>Some ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters of subfamilies B, C and G confer resistance to xenobiotics including insecticides. We identified genes of these subfamilies expressed by the lepidopterans <span class="annotated ">Trichoplusia ni</span> and <span class="annotated ">Bombyx mori</span>. The <span class="annotated ">B. mori</span> genome includes eight, six and 13 ABC-B, -C and -G genes, respectively, which encode P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance protein, MRP, and breast cancer resistance protein, BCRP, homologues. Among the ABC-C and -G subfamilies, gene duplication contributes to protein diversity. We have identified three ABC-B and two ABC-C <span class="annotated ">T. ni</span> genes. Analyses of the <span class="annotated ">T. ni</span> MRP (TrnMRP) revealed unique features, including the potential for TrnMRP4 hyperglycosylation and the alternative splicing of TrnMRP1. Taken together, these attributes of <span class="match linneaus_only ">moth</span> multidrug resistance-associated ABCs may confer distinct functional capacities to xenobiotic efflux. 
<h3>21793956</h3>Identification and expression analysis of nervous wreck, which is preferentially expressed in the brain of the male <span class="annotated ">silkworm moth</span>, <span class="annotated ">Bombyx mori</span>. <br><br>Sexually dimorphic neural circuits are essential for reproductive behaviour. The molecular basis of sexual dimorphism in the <span class="annotated ">silkworm moth</span> (<span class="annotated ">Bombyx mori</span>) brain, however, is unclear. We conducted cDNA subtraction screening and identified nervous wreck (Bmnwk), a synaptic growth regulatory gene, whose expression is higher in the male brain than in the female brain of the <span class="annotated ">silkworm</span>. Bmnwk was preferentially expressed in the brain at the late pupae and adult stages. In situ hybridization revealed that Bmnwk is highly expressed in the optic lobe of the male <span class="match linneaus_only ">moth</span> brain. These findings suggest that Bmnwk has a role in the development and/or maintenance of the optic lobe in the male <span class="annotated ">silkworm</span> brain.
