</br>
Homologues of the <b>Drosophila</b> behaviour - linked genes shaker ( shkr ) and slowmo ( slmo ) were identified from SB__Ostrinia SI__nubilalis ( Lepidoptera : Crambidae ) . 
</br>
Expression analysis of the tryptophan hydroxylase gene TRH and phenylalanine - tryptophan hydroxylase gene TPH , which are selectively involved in neuronal and peripheral 5 - HT synthesis in <b>Drosophila</b> , suggested that two 5 - HT synthesis pathways co - exist in the cricket neuronal tissues .
