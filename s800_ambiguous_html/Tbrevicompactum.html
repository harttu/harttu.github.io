<h2>T. brevicompactum</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21145409</h3>Overexpression of the trichodiene synthase gene tri5 increases trichodermin production and antimicrobial activity in <span class="yellow">Trichoderma brevicompactum</span>. <br><br><span class="yellow">Trichoderma brevicompactum</span> produces trichodermin, a simple trichothecene-type toxin that shares the first steps of the sesquiterpene biosynthetic pathway with other phytotoxic trichothecenes from <span class="yellow">Fusarium spp</span>. Trichodiene synthase catalyses the conversion of farnesyl pyrophosphate to trichodiene and it is encoded by the tri5 gene that was cloned and analysed functionally by homologous overexpression in <span class="blue">T. brevicompactum</span>. tri5 expression was up-regulated in media with glucose, H(2)O(2) or glycerol. tri5 repression was observed in cultures supplemented with the antioxidants ferulic acid and tyrosol. Acetone extracts of tri5-overexpressing transformants displayed higher antifungal activity than those from the wild-type. Chromatographic and spectroscopic analyses revealed that tri5 overexpression led to an increased production of trichodermin and tyrosol. Agar diffusion assays with these two purified metabolites from the tri5-overexpressing transformant <span class="blue">T. brevicompactum</span> Tb41tri5 showed that only trichodermin had antifungal activity against <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, <span class="yellow">Kluyveromyces marxianus</span>, <span class="yellow">Candida albicans</span>, <span class="yellow">Candida glabrata</span>, <span class="yellow">Candida tropicalis</span> and <span class="yellow">Aspergillus fumigatus</span>, in most cases such activity being higher than that observed for amphotericin B and hygromycin. Our results point to the significant role of tri5 in the production of trichodermin and in the antifungal activity of <span class="blue">T. brevicompactum</span>.
