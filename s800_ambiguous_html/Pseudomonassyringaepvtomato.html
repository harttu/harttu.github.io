<h2>Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20854394</h3>SGT1 contributes to coronatine signaling and <span class="blue">Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato</span> disease symptom development in <span class="yellow">tomato</span> and <span class="yellow">Arabidopsis</span>. <br><br>* <span class="yellow">Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000</span> (<span class="yellow">Pst DC3000</span>) causes an economically important bacterial speck disease on <span class="yellow">tomato</span> and produces symptoms with necrotic lesions surrounded by chlorosis. The chlorosis is mainly attributed to a jasmonic acid (JA)-isoleucine analogue, coronatine (COR), produced by <span class="yellow">Pst DC3000</span>. However, the molecular processes underlying lesion development and COR-induced chlorosis are poorly understood. * In this study, we took advantage of a chlorotic phenotype elicited by COR on <span class="yellow">Nicotiana benthamiana</span> leaves and virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) as a rapid reverse genetic screening tool and identified a role for SGT1 (suppressor of G2 allele of skp1) in COR-induced chlorosis. * Silencing of SGT1 in <span class="yellow">tomato</span> resulted in reduction of disease-associated symptoms (cell death and chlorosis), suggesting a molecular connection between COR-induced chlorosis and cell death. In <span class="yellow">Arabidopsis</span>, AtSGT1b but not AtSGT1a was required for COR responses, including root growth inhibition and <span class="yellow">Pst DC3000</span> symptom (water soaked lesion) development. Notably, overexpression of AtSGT1b did not alter <span class="yellow">Pst DC3000</span> symptoms or sensitivity to COR. * Taken together, our results demonstrate that SGT1/SGT1b is required for COR-induced chlorosis and subsequent necrotic disease development in <span class="yellow">tomato</span> and <span class="yellow">Arabidopsis</span>. SGT1 is therefore a component of the COR/JA-mediated signal transduction pathway.
