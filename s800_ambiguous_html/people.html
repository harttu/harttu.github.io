<h2>people</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21093904</h3>The health of prisoners.<br><br>More than 10 million <span class="match linneaus_only ">people</span> are incarcerated worldwide; this number has increased by about a million in the past decade. Mental disorders and infectious diseases are more common in prisoners than in the general population. High rates of suicide within prison and increased mortality from all causes on release have been documented in many countries. The contribution of prisons to illness is unknown, although shortcomings in treatment and aftercare provision contribute to adverse outcomes. Research has highlighted that <span class="linneaus_only ">women</span>, prisoners aged 55 years and older, and juveniles present with higher rates of many disorders than do other prisoners. The contribution of initiatives to improve the health of prisoners by reducing the burden of infectious and chronic diseases, suicide, other causes of premature mortality and violence, and counteracting the cycle of reoffending should be further examined. 
<h3>21227492</h3>Health care and equity in India.<br><br>In India, despite improvements in access to health care, inequalities are related to socioeconomic status, geography, and gender, and are compounded by high out-of-pocket expenditures, with more than three-quarters of the increasing financial burden of health care being met by households. Health-care expenditures exacerbate poverty, with about 39 million additional <span class="match linneaus_only ">people</span> falling into poverty every year as a result of such expenditures. We identify key challenges for the achievement of equity in service provision, and equity in financing and financial risk protection in India. These challenges include an imbalance in resource allocation, inadequate physical access to high-quality health services and <span class="annotated ">human</span> resources for health, high out-of-pocket health expenditures, inflation in health spending, and behavioural factors that affect the demand for appropriate health care. Use of equity metrics in monitoring, assessment, and strategic planning; investment in development of a rigorous knowledge base of health-systems research; development of a refined equity-focused process of deliberative decision making in health reform; and redefinition of the specific responsibilities and accountabilities of key actors are needed to try to achieve equity in health care in India. The implementation of these principles with strengthened public health and primary-care services will help to ensure a more equitable health care for India's population. 
<h3>21227494</h3>Reproductive health, and <span class="linneaus_only ">child</span> health and nutrition in India: meeting the challenge. <br><br>India, with a population of more than 1 billion <span class="match linneaus_only ">people</span>, has many challenges in improving the health and nutrition of its citizens. Steady declines have been noted in fertility, maternal, <span class="linneaus_only ">infant</span> and <span class="linneaus_only ">child</span> mortalities, and the prevalence of severe manifestations of nutritional deficiencies, but the pace has been slow and falls short of national and Millennium Development Goal targets. The likely explanations include social inequities, disparities in health systems between and within states, and consequences of urbanisation and demographic transition. In 2005, India embarked on the National Rural Health Mission, an extraordinary effort to strengthen the health systems. However, coverage of priority interventions remains insufficient, and the content and quality of existing interventions are suboptimum. Substantial unmet need for contraception remains, adolescent pregnancies are common, and access to safe abortion is inadequate. Increases in the numbers of deliveries in institutions have not been matched by improvements in the quality of intrapartum and neonatal care. Infants and young <span class="linneaus_only ">children</span> do not get the health care they need; access to effective treatment for neonatal illness, diarrhoea, and pneumonia shows little improvement; and the coverage of nutrition programmes is inadequate. Absence of well functioning health systems is indicated by the inadequacies related to planning, financing, <span class="annotated ">human</span> resources, infrastructure, supply systems, governance, information, and monitoring. We provide a case for transformation of health systems through effective stewardship, decentralised planning in districts, a reasoned approach to financing that affects demand for health care, a campaign to create awareness and change health and nutrition behaviour, and revision of programmes for <span class="linneaus_only ">child</span> nutrition on the basis of evidence. This agenda needs political commitment of the highest order and the development of a people's movement. 
<h3>21269678</h3>Emerging infectious diseases in southeast Asia: regional challenges to control.<br><br>Southeast Asia is a hotspot for emerging infectious diseases, including those with pandemic potential. Emerging infectious diseases have exacted heavy public health and economic tolls. Severe acute respiratory syndrome rapidly decimated the region's tourist industry. Influenza <span class="unannotated ">A</span> <span class="unannotated ">H5N1</span> has had a profound effect on the <span class="unannotated ">poultry</span> industry. The reasons why southeast Asia is at risk from emerging infectious diseases are complex. The region is home to dynamic systems in which biological, social, ecological, and technological processes interconnect in ways that enable microbes to exploit new ecological niches. These processes include population growth and movement, urbanisation, changes in food production, agriculture and land use, water and sanitation, and the effect of health systems through generation of drug resistance. Southeast Asia is home to about 600 million <span class="match linneaus_only ">people</span> residing in countries as diverse as Singapore, a city state with a gross domestic product (GDP) of US$37,500 per head, and Laos, until recently an overwhelmingly rural economy, with a GDP of US$890 per head. The regional challenges in control of emerging infectious diseases are formidable and range from influencing the factors that drive disease emergence, to making surveillance systems fit for purpose, and ensuring that regional governance mechanisms work effectively to improve control interventions. 
<h3>21349766</h3>Treatment implications of the emerging molecular classification system for melanoma. <br><br>Melanoma is an aggressive disease with few standard treatment options. The conventional classification system for this disease is based on histological growth patterns, with division into four subtypes: superficial spreading, lentigo maligna, nodular, and acral lentiginous. Major limitations of this classification system are absence of prognostic importance and little correlation with treatment outcomes. Recent preclinical and clinical findings support the notion that melanoma is not one malignant disorder but rather a family of distinct molecular diseases. Incorporation of genetic signatures into the conventional histopathological classification of melanoma has great implications for development of new and effective treatments. Genes of the mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway harbour alterations sometimes identified in <span class="match linneaus_only ">people</span> with melanoma. The mutation Val600Glu in the BRAF oncogene (designated BRAF(V600E)) has been associated with sensitivity in vitro and in vivo to agents that inhibit BRAF(V600E) or MEK (a kinase in the MAPK pathway). Melanomas arising from mucosal, acral, chronically sun-damaged surfaces sometimes have oncogenic mutations in KIT, against which several inhibitors have shown clinical efficacy. Some uveal melanomas have activating mutations in GNAQ and GNA11, rendering them potentially susceptible to MEK inhibition. These findings suggest that prospective genotyping of <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span> with melanoma should be used increasingly as we work to develop new and effective treatments for this disease. 
<h3>21371658</h3>Guidelines for hospital-acquired pneumonia and health-care-associated pneumonia: a vulnerability, a pitfall, and a fatal flaw. <br><br>The 2005 American Thoracic Society and Infectious Disease Society of America's guidelines for pneumonia introduced the new category of health-care-associated pneumonia, which increased the number of <span class="match linneaus_only ">people</span> to whom the guidelines for multidrug-resistant pathogens applied. Three fundamental issues inherent in the definition of hospital-acquired pneumonia and health-care-associated pneumonia undermined the credibility of these guidelines and the applicability of their recommendations: a vulnerability, a pitfall, and a fatal flaw. The vulnerability is the extreme heterogeneity of the population of <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span>. The fatal flaw is the failure to accurately diagnose hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia; inability to distinguish colonisation from infection in respiratory-tract cultures renders the guidelines inherently unstable. The pitfall is spiralling empiricism of antibiotic use for severely ill <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span> in whom infection might not be present. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> vicious circle of antibiotic overuse leading to emergence of resistant microflora can become established, leading to unnecessary use of empirical broad-spectrum combination antibiotics and increased mortality. Controlled studies now show that administration of broad-spectrum combination antibiotic therapy can lead to increased mortality in uninfected <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span>. Proposed solutions include the use of individualised assessment of <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span>. Health-care-associated pneumonia should be broken down into several distinct subgroups so narrow-spectrum antibiotic therapy can be used. Emphasis should be placed on defining the microbial cause of the pneumonia rather than reflex administration of empirical combination therapy. 
<h3>21371747</h3>Alzheimer's disease.<br><br>An estimated 24 million <span class="match linneaus_only ">people</span> worldwide have dementia, the majority of whom are thought to have Alzheimer's disease. Thus, Alzheimer's disease represents a major public health concern and has been identified as a research priority. Although there are licensed treatments that can alleviate symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, there is a pressing need to improve our understanding of pathogenesis to enable development of disease-modifying treatments. Methods for improving diagnosis are also moving forward, but a better consensus is needed for development of a panel of biological and neuroimaging biomarkers that support clinical diagnosis. There is now strong evidence of potential risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and cognitive decline, but further work is needed to understand these better and to establish whether interventions can substantially lower these risks. In this Seminar, we provide an overview of recent evidence regarding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and discuss potential ways to reduce the risk of developing the disease. 
<h3>21453963</h3>Glaucoma.<br><br>Most medical practitioners have regular contact with adults who have one of the two forms of glaucoma: open-angle glaucoma or angle-closure glaucoma. Data from population-based surveys indicate that one in 40 adults older than 40 years has glaucoma with loss of visual function, which equates to 60 million <span class="match linneaus_only ">people</span> worldwide being affected and 8*4 million being bilaterally blind. Even in developed countries, half of glaucoma cases are undiagnosed. Glaucoma is mostly asymptomatic until late in the disease when visual problems arise. Vision loss from glaucoma cannot be recovered, and improved case-detection methods for glaucoma are needed. Glaucoma is commonly treated with daily eye-drop drugs, but adherence to treatment is often unsatisfactory. As a usually asymptomatic and chronic disease, glaucoma has similar treatment challenges to chronic systemic diseases. Similarities to the pathogenesis of common CNS diseases mean that common neuroprotective strategies might exist. Successful gene therapy, which has been used for other eye diseases might be possible for the treatment of glaucoma in the future. 
<h3>21498115</h3>No paradox, no progress: inverse cancer comorbidity in <span class="match linneaus_only ">people</span> with other complex diseases. <br><br>In the past 5 years, several leading groups have attempted to explain why individuals with Down's syndrome have a reduced risk of many solid tumours and an increased risk of leukaemia and testicular cancer. Niels Bohr, the Danish physicist, noted that a paradox could initiate progress. We think that the paradox of a medical disorder protecting against cancer could be formalised in a new model of inverse cancer morbidity in <span class="match linneaus_only ">people</span> with other serious diseases. In this Personal View, we review evidence from epidemiological and clinical studies that supports a consistently lower than expected occurrence of cancer in <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span> with Down's syndrome, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and anorexia nervosa. Intriguingly, most comorbidities are neuropsychiatric or CNS disorders. We provide a brief overview of evidence indicating genetic and molecular connections between cancer and these complex diseases. Inverse comorbidity could be a valuable model to investigate common or related pathways or processes and test new therapies, but, most importantly, to understand why certain <span class="match linneaus_only ">people</span> are protected from the malignancy. 
<h3>21511198</h3>The pharmacological treatment of epilepsy in adults.<br><br>Treatment decisions in epilepsy need to be individualised on the basis of careful analysis of the risk-benefit ratio of each available option. Key decision steps include the time at which antiepileptic drug treatment should be started, which drug should be chosen for first-line therapy, and which strategy is most appropriate for <span class="match linneaus_only ">people</span> who did not respond to the initially prescribed drug. With more than 20 antiepileptic drugs currently available to treat epilepsy in adults, opportunities to tailor drug therapy have never been greater, but optimum use of such a complex armamentarium is a challenge even for the epilepsy specialist. Antiepileptic drug choice is primarily based on evidence of efficacy and effectiveness for the individual's seizure type, but other patient-specific factors need to be considered, including age, sex, childbearing potential, comorbidities, and concomitant medications. 
<h3>21511329</h3><span class="annotated ">Hepatitis delta virus</span>.<br><br><span class="annotated ">Hepatitis delta virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">HDV</span>) is a small, defective RNA <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> that can infect only individuals who have <span class="annotated ">hepatitis B virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">HBV</span>); worldwide more than 15 million <span class="match linneaus_only ">people</span> are co-infected. There are eight reported genotypes of <span class="annotated ">HDV</span> with unexplained variations in their geographical distribution and pathogenicity. The <span class="annotated ">hepatitis D</span> virion is composed of a coat of <span class="annotated ">HBV</span> envelope proteins surrounding the nucleocapsid, which consists of a single-stranded, circular RNA genome complexed with delta antigen, the <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> protein. <span class="annotated ">HDV</span> is clinically important because although it suppresses <span class="annotated ">HBV</span> replication, it causes severe liver disease with rapid progression to cirrhosis and hepatic decompensation. The range of clinical presentation is wide, varying from mild disease to fulminant liver failure. The prevalence of <span class="annotated ">HDV</span> is declining in some endemic areas but increasing in northern and central Europe because of immigration. Treatment of <span class="annotated ">HDV</span> is with pegylated interferon alfa; however, response rates are poor. Increased understanding of the molecular virology of <span class="annotated ">HDV</span> will identify novel therapeutic targets for this most severe form of chronic <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> hepatitis. 
<h3>21526934</h3>Factors of susceptibility of <span class="annotated ">human</span> myiasis caused by the <span class="annotated ">New World screw-worm</span>, <span class="annotated ">Cochliomyia hominivorax</span> in Sao Gonsigmaalo, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. <br><br>This study was carried out between July 2007 and June 2008 and reports on the occurrence of <span class="annotated ">human</span> myiasis caused by the New World screwworm, <span class="annotated ">Cochliomyia hominivorax</span> (Coquerel) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) in Sao Gonsigmaalo in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Liquid or solid vaseline was used to suffocate the larvae, which were then preserved in 70% ethanol and sent to the Instituto Oswaldo Cruz for identification. <span class="annotated ">C. hominivorax</span> were identified in all 22 cases of myiasis. There were 12 male and 10 female <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span> with ages ranging from 03 to 71. Ethnically the highest incidence was among <span class="unannotated ">black</span> <span class="match linneaus_only ">people</span>, with 17 cases. Open wounds were the main cause of the parasitosis, whereas poor personal hygiene, the low educational level, alcoholism, bedridden <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span>, and physical or mental disability were possibly secondary factors; in addition to all these factors the income of the <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span> was very low. 
<h3>21227489</h3>Towards achievement of universal health care in India by 2020: a call to action. <br><br>To sustain the positive economic trajectory that India has had during the past decade, and to honour the fundamental right of all citizens to adequate health care, the health of all Indian <span class="match linneaus_only ">people</span> has to be given the highest priority in public policy. We propose the creation of the Integrated National Health System in India through provision of universal health insurance, establishment of autonomous organisations to enable accountable and evidence-based good-quality health-care practices and development of appropriately trained <span class="annotated ">human</span> resources, the restructuring of health governance to make it coordinated and decentralised, and legislation of health entitlement for all Indian <span class="match linneaus_only ">people</span>. The key characteristics of our proposal are to strengthen the public health system as the primary provider of promotive, preventive, and curative health services in India, to improve quality and reduce the out-of-pocket expenditure on health care through a well regulated integration of the private sector within the national health-care system. Dialogue and consensus building among the stakeholders in the government, civil society, and private sector are the next steps to formalise the actions needed and to monitor their achievement. In our call to action, we propose that India must achieve health care for all by 2020. 
<h3>21474174</h3>Priority actions for the non-communicable disease crisis.<br><br>The UN High-Level Meeting on Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) in September, 2011, is an unprecedented opportunity to create a sustained global movement against premature death and preventable morbidity and disability from NCDs, mainly heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory disease. The increasing global crisis in NCDs is a barrier to development goals including poverty reduction, health equity, economic stability, and <span class="annotated ">human</span> security. The Lancet NCD Action Group and the NCD Alliance propose five overarching priority actions for the response to the crisis--leadership, prevention, treatment, international cooperation, and monitoring and accountability--and the delivery of five priority interventions--<span class="annotated ">tobacco</span> control, salt reduction, improved diets and physical activity, reduction in hazardous alcohol intake, and essential drugs and technologies. The priority interventions were chosen for their health effects, cost-effectiveness, low costs of implementation, and political and financial feasibility. The most urgent and immediate priority is <span class="annotated ">tobacco</span> control. We propose as a goal for 2040, a world essentially free from <span class="annotated ">tobacco</span> where less than 5% of <span class="match linneaus_only ">people</span> use <span class="unannotated ">tobacco</span>. Implementation of the priority interventions, at an estimated global commitment of about US$9 billion per year, will bring enormous benefits to social and economic development and to the health sector. If widely adopted, these interventions will achieve the global goal of reducing NCD death rates by 2% per year, averting tens of millions of premature deaths in this decade. 
<h3>21435599</h3>Long-term outcomes of <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span> with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.<br><br>More and more <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span> survive aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH), with case fatality decreasing by 17% in absolute terms over the past three decades and incidence remaining relatively stable at nine per 100,000 patient-years. The mean age at which aSAH occurs is reasonably young at 55 years, and <span class="match linneaus_only ">people</span> of this age in the general population have a good life expectancy. However, there are few data for life expectancy after aSAH, and the risks of late recurrent aSAH and other vascular diseases are unclear. The course of associated long-term physical and cognitive deficits after aSAH is not well established, leading to questions about potential outcomes to quality of life and working capacity, as well as best clinical practices.
