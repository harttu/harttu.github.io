<h2>rabbits</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20951743</h3>Development and validation of a lateral flow immunoassay using colloidal gold for the identification of serotype-specific <span class="yellow">foot-and-mouth disease virus O</span>, <span class="yellow">A</span> and <span class="yellow">Asia 1</span>. 

A lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) was developed to identify and diagnose <span class="yellow">foot-and-mouth disease virus</span> (<span class="yellow">FMDV</span>) serotypes <span class="yellow">O</span>, <span class="yellow">A</span> and <span class="yellow">Asia 1</span>. Antibodies obtained from <span class="blue">rabbits</span> and guinea <span class="yellow">pigs</span> immunized with cell-culture-adapted <span class="yellow">virus</span> strains (<span class="yellow">O/CHA/99</span>, <span class="yellow">A/GS/LX/66</span>, <span class="yellow">Asia 1/CHN/05</span>) and suckling-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> adapted <span class="yellow">virus</span> strains (<span class="yellow">O/AV99(L)</span>, <span class="yellow">A/AV88(L)</span>, <span class="yellow">Asia 1/YNBS/58</span>) were used as capture antibodies. The diagnostic kit included three immunochromatographic strips of types <span class="yellow">O</span>, <span class="yellow">A</span> and <span class="yellow">Asia 1</span>, and the type-specific results were confirmed by color on the test lines of the three strips. The LFI was evaluated using epithelial and vesicular samples (n=396) prepared from current and historical field samples (provide by the National Foot-and-Mouth Disease Reference Laboratory of China at Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute). Negative samples (n=95) were collected from healthy animals. The diagnostic sensitivity of the LFI for <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> serotypes <span class="yellow">O</span>, <span class="yellow">A</span> and <span class="yellow">Asia 1</span> was 88.3% compared to 89.7% obtained by the reference method of indirect-sandwich ELISA. The sensitivity of the LFI for <span class="yellow">FMDV type Asia 1</span> was higher at 92.1% compared to 90.5% for the ELISA. The specificity of the LFI was 97.1% compared with 97.4%. 
<h3>20962094</h3><span class="yellow">Yeast</span>-elicited cross-reactive antibodies to <span class="yellow">HIV</span> Env glycans efficiently neutralize virions expressing exclusively high-mannose N-linked glycans. 

The <span class="yellow">HIV</span> envelope (Env) protein uses a dense coat of glycans to mask conserved domains and evade host humoral immune responses. The broadly neutralizing antibody 2G12, which binds a specific cluster of high-mannose glycans on <span class="yellow">HIV</span> Env, shows that the glycan shield can also serve as a target for neutralizing antibodies. We have described a triple mutant <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> strain that expresses high-mannose glycoproteins that bind to 2G12. When used to immunize <span class="blue">rabbits</span>, this <span class="yellow">yeast</span> elicits antibodies that bind to gp120-associated glycans but fail to neutralize <span class="yellow">virus</span>. Here we sought to determine the reason for these discordant results. Affinity purification of sera over columns conjugated with three 2G12-reactive <span class="yellow">yeast</span> glycoproteins showed that these proteins could adsorb 80% of the antibodies that bind to gp120 glycans. Despite binding to monomeric gp120, these mannose-specific antibodies failed to bind cell surface-expressed trimeric Env. However, when Env was expressed in the presence of the mannosidase inhibitor kifunensine to force retention of high-mannose glycans at all sites, the purified antibodies gained the abilities to bind trimeric Env and to strongly and broadly neutralize viruses produced under these conditions. Combined, these data show that the triple mutant <span class="yellow">yeast</span> strain elicits antibodies that bind to high-mannose glycans presented on the <span class="yellow">HIV</span> envelope, but only when they are displayed in a manner not found on native Env trimers. This implies that the underlying structure of the protein scaffold used to present the high-mannose glycans may be critical to allow elicitation of antibodies that recognize trimeric Env and neutralize <span class="yellow">virus</span>.
