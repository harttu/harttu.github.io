<h2>S. ratti</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20139281</h3><span class="yellow">Streptococcus ursoris sp. nov.</span>, isolated from the oral cavities of bears.<br><br>Three Gram-positive, catalase-negative, coccus-shaped organisms were isolated from the oral cavities of bears. The isolates were tentatively identified as a streptococcal species based on the results of biochemical tests. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies confirmed that the organisms were members of the genus Streptococcus, but they did not correspond to any recognized species of the genus. The nearest phylogenetic relative of the new isolates was <span class="yellow">Streptococcus ratti ATCC 19645</span>(T) (98.6 %), however, DNA-DNA hybridization analysis showed that the isolates displayed less than 15 % DNA-DNA relatedness with the type strain of <span class="blue">S. ratti</span>. Colonies of the novel strains grown on mitis salivarius agar showed an extracellular polysaccharide-producing colony morphology. Based on phenotypic and phylogenetic evidence, it is proposed that the novel isolates are classified in the genus Streptococcus as <span class="yellow">Streptococcus ursoris sp. nov.</span> The type strain of <span class="yellow">S. ursoris</span> is <span class="yellow">NUM 1615(T)</span> (=JCM 16316(T)=DSM 22768(T)).
