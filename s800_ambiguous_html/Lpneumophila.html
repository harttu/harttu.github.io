<h2>L. pneumophila</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21169481</h3>Antibiotics and UV radiation induce competence for natural transformation in <span class="yellow">Legionella pneumophila</span>. 

Natural transformation by competence is a major mechanism of horizontal gene transfer in bacteria. Competence is defined as the genetically programmed physiological state that enables bacteria to actively take up DNA from the environment. The conditions that signal competence development are multiple and elusive, complicating the understanding of its evolutionary significance. We used expression of the competence gene comEA as a reporter of competence development and screened several hundred molecules for their ability to induce competence in the freshwater living pathogen <span class="yellow">Legionella pneumophila</span>. We found that comEA expression is induced by chronic exposure to genotoxic molecules such as mitomycin C and antibiotics of the fluoroquinolone family. These results indicated that, in <span class="blue">L. pneumophila</span>, competence may be a response to genotoxic stress. Sunlight-emitted UV light represents a major source of genotoxic stress in the environment and we found that exposure to UV radiation effectively induces competence development. For the first time, we show that genetic exchanges by natural transformation occur within an UV-stressed population. Genotoxic stress induces the RecA-dependent SOS response in many bacteria. However, genetic and phenotypic evidence suggest that <span class="blue">L. pneumophila</span> lacks a prototypic SOS response and competence development in response to genotoxic stress is RecA independent. Our results strengthen the hypothesis that competence may have evolved as a DNA damage response in SOS-deficient bacteria. This parasexual response to DNA damage may have enabled <span class="blue">L. pneumophila</span> to acquire and propagate foreign genes, contributing to the emergence of this <span class="yellow">human</span> pathogen. 
<h3>21034773</h3>Comparison of commercial systems for extraction of nucleic acids from DNA/RNA respiratory pathogens. 

This study compared six automated nucleic acid extraction systems and one manual kit for their ability to recover nucleic acids from <span class="yellow">human</span> nasal wash specimens spiked with five respiratory pathogens, representing Gram-positive bacteria (<span class="yellow">Streptococcus pyogenes</span>), Gram-negative bacteria (<span class="yellow">Legionella pneumophila</span>), DNA viruses (adenovirus), segmented RNA viruses (<span class="yellow">human influenza virus A</span>), and non-segmented RNA viruses (<span class="yellow">respiratory syncytial virus</span>). The robots and kit evaluated represent major commercially available methods that are capable of simultaneous extraction of DNA and RNA from respiratory specimens, and included platforms based on magnetic-bead technology (KingFisher mL, Biorobot EZ1, easyMAG, KingFisher Flex, and MagNA Pure Compact) or glass fiber filter technology (Biorobot MDX and the manual kit Allprep). All methods yielded extracts free of cross-contamination and RT-PCR inhibition. All automated systems recovered <span class="blue">L. pneumophila</span> and <span class="yellow">adenovirus</span> DNA equivalently. However, the MagNA Pure protocol demonstrated more than 4-fold higher DNA recovery from the <span class="yellow">S. pyogenes</span> than other methods. The KingFisher mL and easyMAG protocols provided 1- to 3-log wider linearity and extracted 3- to 4-fold more RNA from the <span class="yellow">human influenza virus</span> and <span class="yellow">respiratory syncytial virus</span>. These findings suggest that systems differed in nucleic acid recovery, reproducibility, and linearity in a pathogen specific manner.
