<h2>Betaproteobacteria</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21420905</h3>Phylogenetic validation of the genera Angomonas and Strigomonas of trypanosomatids harboring bacterial endosymbionts with the description of new species of trypanosomatids and of proteobacterial symbionts. <br><br>We comparatively examined the nutritional, molecular and optical and electron microscopical characteristics of reference species and new isolates of trypanosomatids harboring bacterial endosymbionts. Sequencing of the V7V8 region of the small subunit of the ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene distinguished six major genotypes among the 13 isolates examined. The entire sequences of the SSU rRNA and glycosomal glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) genes were obtained for phylogenetic analyses. In the resulting phylogenetic trees, the symbiont-harboring species clustered as a major clade comprising two subclades that corresponded to the proposed genera Angomonas and Strigomonas. The genus Angomonas comprised 10 flagellates including former <span class="yellow">Crithidia deanei</span> and <span class="yellow">C. desouzai</span> plus a new species. The genus Strigomonas included former <span class="yellow">Crithidia oncopelti</span> and <span class="yellow">Blastocrithidia culicis</span> plus a new species. Sequences from the internal transcribed spacer of ribosomal DNA (ITS rDNA) and size polymorphism of kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) minicircles revealed considerable genetic heterogeneity within the genera Angomonas and Strigomonas. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rDNA and ITS rDNA sequences demonstrated that all of the endosymbionts belonged to the <span class="red">Betaproteobacteria</span> and revealed three new species. The congruence of the phylogenetic trees of trypanosomatids and their symbionts support a co-divergent host-symbiont evolutionary history. 
<h3>20173005</h3><span class="yellow">Thiomonas islandica</span> sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic, hydrogen- and sulfur-oxidizing <span class="yellow">betaproteobacterium</span> isolated from a hot spring. <br><br>A novel, hydrogen- and sulfur-oxidizing bacterium, designated strain <span class="yellow">6C(T)</span>, was isolated from a hot spring in Graendalur, south-western Iceland. Cells of this organism were Gram-reaction-negative, rod-shaped and motile. The strain grew aerobically and was capable of chemolithotrophic growth on thiosulfate and hydrogen, heterotrophic growth on pyruvate, oxalate, acetate and on glutamate in the presence of <span class="yellow">yeast</span> extract and mixotrophic growth on several organic compounds, thiosulfate and/or hydrogen. During growth on thiosulfate, the final product was sulfate, resulting in a drop in pH from 6.8 to 2.7. Heterotrophic growth on pyruvate was observed at pH 4-7 (optimum pH 4) and 35-50 ^0C (optimum 45 ^0C). The DNA G+C content was 65.2 mol%. As determined by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain <span class="yellow">6C(T)</span> represents a distinct species belonging to the class <span class="blue">Betaproteobacteria</span> and is most closely related to <span class="yellow">Thiomonas intermedia</span> <span class="yellow">DSM 18155(T)</span> and <span class="yellow">Thiomonas perometabolis</span> <span class="yellow">DSM 18570(T)</span>. DNA-DNA hybridization between strain <span class="yellow">6C(T)</span> and <span class="yellow">Thiomonas intermedia</span> <span class="yellow">DSM 18155(T)</span> and <span class="yellow">Thiomonas perometabolis</span> <span class="yellow">DSM 18570(T)</span> gave relatedness values below 32 %. These results, together with physiological characteristics, showed that strain <span class="yellow">6C(T)</span> represents a novel species within the genus Thiomonas, for which the name <span class="yellow">Thiomonas islandica</span> sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is <span class="yellow">6C(T)</span> (=<span class="yellow">DSM 21436(T)</span> =<span class="yellow">JCM 16107(T)</span>).
