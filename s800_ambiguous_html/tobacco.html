<h2>tobacco</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20880205</h3>Factors required for the high CO2 specificity of the anaerobically induced <span class="yellow">maize</span> GapC4 promoter in transgenic <span class="blue">tobacco</span>. 

Flooding, a natural cause of anaerobiosis, is often accompanied by high CO(2) concentrations in the flood water. Plants need to respond to these environmental conditions. Strong anaerobic reporter gene activity in <span class="blue">tobacco</span> (<span class="yellow">Nicotiana tabacum</span>) controlled by the glycolytic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GapC4) promoter from <span class="yellow">maize</span> (<span class="yellow">Zea mays</span>) depends on the presence of CO(2) and light. To identify factors required for CO(2) regulated gene expression, promoter deletions fused to the Beta-glucuronidase reporter gene were studied in transgenic <span class="blue">tobacco</span>. Deletion of a 40 bp fragment directly upstream of the TATA box leads to increased anaerobic reporter gene activity both, in the presence and absence of CO(2). This deletion does not affect light specific anaerobic expression. <span class="yellow">A</span> positive correlation between increasing CO(2) concentrations and gene activity is observed. Electrophoretic mobility shift experiments indicate that <span class="blue">tobacco</span> nuclear extracts harbour proteins that bind to part of the 40 bp fragment. Database assisted as well as experimental analysis reveal a role for AP2/EREBP transcription factors for conferring the high CO(2) specificity to the GapC4 promoter in <span class="blue">tobacco</span> leaves. This work highlights the importance for plants to respond to high environmental CO(2) concentrations under anaerobic conditions. 
<h3>21227486</h3>Chronic diseases and injuries in India.

Chronic diseases (eg, cardiovascular diseases, mental health disorders, diabetes, and cancer) and injuries are the leading causes of death and disability in India, and we project pronounced increases in their contribution to the burden of disease during the next 25 years. Most chronic diseases are equally prevalent in poor and rural populations and often occur together. Although a wide range of cost-effective primary and secondary prevention strategies are available, their coverage is generally low, especially in poor and rural populations. Much of the care for chronic diseases and injuries is provided in the private sector and can be very expensive. Sufficient evidence exists to warrant immediate action to scale up interventions for chronic diseases and injuries through private and public sectors; improved public health and primary health-care systems are essential for the implementation of cost-effective interventions. We strongly advocate the need to strengthen social and policy frameworks to enable the implementation of interventions such as taxation on bidis (small hand-rolled cigarettes), smokeless <span class="blue">tobacco</span>, and locally brewed alcohols. We also advocate the integration of national programmes for various chronic diseases and injuries with one another and with national health agendas. India has already passed the early stages of a chronic disease and injury epidemic; in view of the implications for future disease burden and the demographic transition that is in progress in India, the rate at which effective prevention and control is implemented should be substantially increased. The emerging agenda of chronic diseases and injuries should be a political priority and central to national consciousness, if universal health care is to be achieved. 
<h3>22182623</h3>Interspecific Interactions Between <span class="yellow">Bemisia tabaci</span> Biotype B and <span class="yellow">Trialeurodes vaporariorum</span> (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae). 

<span class="yellow">Bemisia tabaci</span> (Gennadius) biotype B and <span class="yellow">Trialeurodes vaporariorum</span> (Westwood) are invasive whitefly species that often co-occur on greenhouse-grown vegetables in northern China. Although <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> biotype B has been present in China for a relatively short period of time, it has become dominant over <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span>. We studied the interspecific competitive interactions between the two species in single or mixed cultures at 24 +/- 1^0C, 40 +/- 5% RH, and L14:D10 h photoperiod. Female longevity on <span class="yellow">tomato</span> was not significantly different between species, but <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> reproduced 4.3 to 4.9 fold more progeny. The ratio of female to male progeny in both instances was greater for <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span>. When cultured on <span class="yellow">tomato</span>, <span class="yellow">cotton</span>, and <span class="blue">tobacco</span>, <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> developed 0.8, 3.3, and 4.7 d earlier in single culture, and 1.8, 3.9, and 4.3 d earlier in mixed culture. <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> displaced <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span> in four, five and six generations when the initial ratios of <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> to <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span> were 15:15, 20:10, or 10:20 on <span class="yellow">tomato</span>. Populations of <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> were 2.3 fold higher than that of <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span> on <span class="yellow">tomato</span><span class="yellow">tomato plants</span> for seven consecutive generations in single culture. <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> performed better in development, survival, fecundity, and female ratio. We conclude that <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> could displace <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span> in as short as four generations in a controlled greenhouse environment when they start at equal proportions. Warmer greenhouse conditions and an increase in total greenhouse area could be contributing factors in the recent dominance of <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span>. 
<h3>20951091</h3>Genetics of lung-cancer susceptibility.

Lung cancer is the most common form of cancer death worldwide. Although reduction of <span class="blue">tobacco</span> consumption remains the most appropriate strategy to reduce lung-cancer burden, identification of genes involved in the cause of disease could contribute to further understanding of the underlying mechanisms, and eventually lead to additional prevention strategies and targeted treatments. Common gene variants involved in lung cancer have been recently identified through large, collaborative, genome-wide association studies. These studies identified three separate loci that are associated with lung cancer (5p15, 6p21, and 15q25) and include genes that regulate acetylcholine nicotinic receptors and telomerase production. However, much about genetic risk remains to be discovered, and rarer gene variants, such as those of the CHEK2 gene, likely account for most of the remaining risk. There is also a need for studies that investigate how genetic susceptibility is associated with clinical outcome measures, including treatment response and tumour relapse. 
<h3>21241331</h3>Expression of a <span class="yellow">Brassica napus</span> heme oxygenase confers plant tolerance to mercury toxicity. 

Plant heme oxygenases (HOs) regulate biosynthesis of phytochrome which accounts for photo-acceptance and -morphogenesis. Recent studies have demonstrated that plant HOs also regulate many other physiological processes including response to environmental stimuli. To elucidate the mechanism by which HOs regulate plant adaptation to heavy metal exposure, three novel HOs genes were isolated from <span class="yellow">rapeseed</span> (<span class="yellow">Brassica napus</span>) and their expression patterns were analysed. Alignment of deduced protein sequences revealed that the three BnHOs share high identity with their corresponding orthologos (AtHO1-3) from <span class="yellow">Arabidopsis</span>. To investigate whether the BnHO regulates plant tolerance to Hg toxicity, we constructed <span class="yellow">B. napus</span> transgenic plants overexpressing BnHO-1. Under Hg stress, the transgenic plants had 1.41-1.59 folds higher biomass than the untransformants. However, overexpression of BnHO-1 resulted in less accumulation of Hg in some lines of transformants than in untransformants. The transgenic plants show lower abundance of reactive oxygen species and attenuated oxidative injury compared with the untransgenic plants. We cloned the promoter sequences of BnHO-1 from <span class="yellow">B. napus</span>. Analysis revealed that the 1119 bp fragment contains a conserved Cd responsive element (CdRE) and others responding to multiple environmental stimuli. Transient expression in <span class="blue">tobacco</span> leaves showed differential responses to heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Pb, Hg and Cd). 
<h3>21269677</h3>The rise of chronic non-communicable diseases in southeast Asia: time for action. 

Southeast Asia faces an epidemic of chronic non-communicable diseases, now responsible for 60% of deaths in the region. The problem stems from environmental factors that promote <span class="blue">tobacco</span> use, unhealthy diet, and inadequate physical activity. Disadvantaged populations are the hardest hit, with death rates inversely proportional to a country's gross national income. Families shoulder the financial burden, but entire economies suffer as well. Although attempts to control non-communicable diseases are increasing, more needs to be done. Health-care systems need to be redesigned to deliver chronic care that is founded on existing primary health-care facilities, but supported by good referral systems. Surveillance of key modifiable risk factors is needed to monitor the magnitude of the problem and to study the effects of interventions. All branches of government and all sectors of society have to get involved in establishing environments that are conducive to healthy living. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations is in a unique position to make a united stand against chronic non-communicable diseases in the region. Inaction will affect millions of lives-often, the lives of those who have the least. 
<h3>21474174</h3>Priority actions for the non-communicable disease crisis.

The UN High-Level Meeting on Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) in September, 2011, is an unprecedented opportunity to create a sustained global movement against premature death and preventable morbidity and disability from NCDs, mainly heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory disease. The increasing global crisis in NCDs is a barrier to development goals including poverty reduction, health equity, economic stability, and <span class="yellow">human</span> security. The Lancet NCD Action Group and the NCD Alliance propose five overarching priority actions for the response to the crisis--leadership, prevention, treatment, international cooperation, and monitoring and accountability--and the delivery of five priority interventions--<span class="blue">tobacco</span> control, salt reduction, improved diets and physical activity, reduction in hazardous alcohol intake, and essential drugs and technologies. The priority interventions were chosen for their health effects, cost-effectiveness, low costs of implementation, and political and financial feasibility. The most urgent and immediate priority is <span class="blue">tobacco</span> control. We propose as a goal for 2040, a world essentially free from <span class="blue">tobacco</span> where less than 5% of people use <span class="red">tobacco</span>. Implementation of the priority interventions, at an estimated global commitment of about US$9 billion per year, will bring enormous benefits to social and economic development and to the health sector. If widely adopted, these interventions will achieve the global goal of reducing NCD death rates by 2% per year, averting tens of millions of premature deaths in this decade. 
<h3>20946589</h3>Cryptogein, a <span class="yellow">fungal</span> elicitor, remodels the phenylpropanoid metabolism of <span class="blue">tobacco</span> cell suspension cultures in a calcium-dependent manner. 

Plant cells use calcium-based signalling pathways to transduce biotic and/or abiotic stimuli into adaptive responses. However, little is known about the coupling between calcium signalling, transcriptional regulation and the downstream biochemical processes. To understand these relationships better, we challenged <span class="blue">tobacco</span> BY-2 cells with cryptogein and evaluated how calcium transients (monitored through the calcium sensor aequorin) impact (1) transcript levels of phenylpropanoid genes (assessed by RT-qPCR); and (2) derived-phenolic compounds (analysed by mass spectrometry). Most genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway were up-regulated by cryptogein and cell wall-bound phenolic compounds accumulated (mainly 5-hydroxyferulic acid). The accumulation of both transcripts and phenolics was calcium-dependent. The transcriptional regulation of phenylpropanoid genes was correlated in a non-linear manner with stimulus intensity and with components of the cryptogein-induced calcium signature. In addition, calmodulin inhibitors increased the sensitivity of cells to low concentrations of cryptogein. These results led us to propose a model of coupling between the cryptogein signal, calcium signalling and the transcriptional response, exerting control of transcription through the coordinated action of two decoding modules exerting opposite effects. 
<h3>21251018</h3>Using tunable diode laser spectroscopy to measure carbon isotope discrimination and mesophyll conductance to CO2 diffusion dynamically at different CO2 concentrations. 

In C3 leaves, the mesophyll conductance to CO2 diffusion, g(m) , determines the drawdown in CO2 concentration from intercellular airspace to the chloroplast stroma. Both g(m) and stomatal conductance limit photosynthetic rate and vary in response to the environment. We investigated the response of g(m) to changes in CO2 in two <span class="yellow">Arabidopsis</span> genotypes (including a mutant with open stomata, ost1), <span class="red">tobacco</span> and <span class="yellow">wheat</span>. We combined measurements of gas exchange with carbon isotope discrimination using tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy with a CO2 calibration system specially designed for a range of CO2 and O2 concentrations. CO2 was initially increased from 200 to 1000 ppm and then decreased stepwise to 200 ppm and increased stepwise back to 1000 ppm, or the sequence was reversed. In 2% O2 a step increase from 200 to 1000 ppm significantly decreased g(m) by 26-40% in all three species, whereas following a step decrease from 1000 to 200 ppm, the 26-38% increase in g(m) was not statistically significant. The response of g(m) to CO2 was less in 21% O2. Comparing wild type against the ost1 revealed that mesophyll and stomatal conductance varied independently in response to CO2. We discuss the effects of isotope fractionation factors on estimating g(m) .
