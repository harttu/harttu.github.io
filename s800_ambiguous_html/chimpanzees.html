<h2>chimpanzees</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21126914</h3>Tracking a century of global expansion and evolution of <span class="annotated ">HIV</span> to drive understanding and to combat disease. <br><br>Since the isolation of <span class="annotated ">HIV</span>, multiple transmissions are thought to have occurred between <span class="linneaus_only ">man</span> and other old-world primates. Assessment of samples from apes and <span class="annotated ">human</span> beings with African equatorial forest ancestry has traced the origin of <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> to <span class="match annotated ">chimpanzees</span>, and dated its most recent common ancestor to 1908. The evolution of <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> has been rapid, which has resulted in a complex classification, worldwide spread, and intermixing of strains; at least 48 circulating recombinant forms are currently identified. In addition to posing a nearly insurmountable challenge for diagnosis, treatment, vaccine development, and prevention, this extreme and divergent evolution has led to differences in virulence between <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> groups, subtypes, or both. Coincidental changes in <span class="annotated ">human</span> migration in the Congo river basin also affected spread of disease. Research over the past 25 years and advances in genomic sequencing methods, such as deep DNA sequencing, have greatly improved understanding and analysis of the thousands to millions of full infectious <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> genomes.
