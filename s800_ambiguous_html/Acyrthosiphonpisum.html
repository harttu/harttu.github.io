<h2>Acyrthosiphon pisum</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21199018</h3>Analysis of expressed sequence tags from <span class="yellow">Maize mosaic rhabdovirus</span>-infected gut tissues of <span class="yellow">Peregrinus maidis</span> reveals the presence of key components of insect innate immunity. 

The <span class="yellow">corn planthopper</span>, <span class="yellow">Peregrinus maidis</span>, causes direct feeding damage to plants and transmits <span class="yellow">Maize mosaic rhabdovirus (MMV)</span> in a persistent-propagative manner. <span class="yellow">MMV</span> must cross several insect tissue layers for successful transmission to occur, and the gut serves as an important barrier for rhabdovirus transmission. In order to facilitate the identification of proteins that may interact with <span class="yellow">MMV</span> either by facilitating acquisition or responding to <span class="yellow">virus</span> infection, we generated and analysed the gut transcriptome of <span class="yellow">P. maidis</span>. From two normalized cDNA libraries, we generated a <span class="yellow">P. maidis</span> gut transcriptome composed of 20,771 expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Assembly of the sequences yielded 1860 contigs and 14,032 singletons, and biological roles were assigned to 5793 (36%). Comparison of <span class="yellow">P. maidis</span> ESTs with other insect amino acid sequences revealed that <span class="yellow">P. maidis</span> shares greatest sequence similarity with another hemipteran, the <span class="yellow">brown planthopper</span> <span class="yellow">Nilaparvata lugens</span>. We identified 202 <span class="yellow">P. maidis</span> transcripts with putative homology to proteins associated with insect innate immunity, including those implicated in the Toll, Imd, JAK/STAT, Jnk and the small-interfering RNA-mediated pathways. Sequence comparisons between our <span class="yellow">P. maidis</span> gut EST collection and the currently available National Center for Biotechnology Information EST database collection for <span class="yellow">Ni. lugens</span> revealed that a pathogen recognition receptor in the Imd pathway, peptidoglycan recognition protein-long class (PGRP-LC), is present in these two members of the family Delphacidae; however, these recognition receptors are lacking in the model hemipteran <span class="blue">Acyrthosiphon pisum</span>. In addition, we identified sequences in the <span class="yellow">P. maidis</span> gut transcriptome that share significant amino acid sequence similarities with the rhabdovirus receptor molecule, acetylcholine receptor (AChR), found in other hosts. This EST analysis sheds new light on immune response pathways in hemipteran guts that will be useful for further dissecting innate defence response pathways to rhabdovirus infection. 
<h3>21382108</h3>Responses of the <span class="yellow">pea aphid</span> transcriptome to infection by facultative symbionts.

<span class="yellow">Serratia symbiotica</span> is a facultative symbiont of <span class="yellow">pea aphids</span> (<span class="blue">Acyrthosiphon pisum</span>) that provides tolerance to heat stress. Although the phenotypic effects of facultative symbionts upon hosts have been studied in some detail, little is known about the molecular and genomic basis of these interactions. Previous studies show a large impact of <span class="yellow">S. symbiotica</span> upon the aphid metabolome. Whole-genome transcriptional profiling and next-generation sequencing demonstrated expression of 94% of RefSeq genes from the <span class="yellow">pea aphid</span> genome, providing the largest dataset to date on aphid gene expression. However, only 28 genes showed changes in expression with <span class="yellow">S. symbiotica</span> infection, and these changes were of small magnitude. No expression differences in genes involved in innate immunity in other insects were observed. Therefore, the large metabolic impact of <span class="yellow">S. symbiotica</span> is most likely a result of metabolism of the symbiont itself, or of post-transcriptional modification of host gene expression. Although <span class="yellow">S. symbiotica</span> has a major influence on its host's metabolome and resistance to heat, it induces little change in gene expression in its host.
