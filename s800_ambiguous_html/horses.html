</br>
Antibodies to non - structural protein 1 ( NS1 ) of West Nile virus ( WNV ) have been used to differentiate WNV infection from infection by serologically cross - reactive flaviviruses , including SB__Japanese SI__encephalitis SI__virus ( JEV ) , in <b>horses</b> . 
</br>
However , since the inactivated West Nile ( SB__WN ) vaccine has been reported to induce NS1 antibodies , there is concern about the reliability of using NS1 - based assays for testing vaccinated <b>horses</b> . 
</br>
Both assays are based on NS1 antibodies and were established previously to differentiate SB__WNV from JEV infections in <b>horses</b> . 
</br>
Groups of three <b>horses</b> were vaccinated with two or three doses of a commercial inactivated WN vaccine and NS1 antibodies were detected by a conventional ELISA after the second vaccination .
