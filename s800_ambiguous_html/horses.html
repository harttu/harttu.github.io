Species composition and distribution of large intestinal ciliates were investigated in the feces from 15 <span class="yellow">Turk rahvan horses</span>, living in the vicinity of Izmir, Turkey. Twenty-two ciliate genera consisting of 36 species were identified. This is the first report on intestinal ciliates in <span class="yellow">Turk rahvan horses</span> and no previously unknown species were observed. The mean number of ciliates was 14.2+/-13.9x10(4) cells ml(-1) of feces and the mean number of ciliate species per host was 9.9+/-7.1. No ciliates were observed in 2 <span class="blue">horses</span>. Bundleia and Blepharocorys were considered to be the major genera since these ciliates were constantly found in high proportions. In contrast, Paraisotricha, Didesmis and Gassovskiella were only observed at low frequencies. The ciliates found in this survey had almost the same characteristics as those described in previous reports, suggesting that there was no significant geographic variation in the intestinal ciliate fauna of equids. 
<h3>20974180</h3>Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) antibody-based assays to differentiate <span class="yellow">West Nile</span> (WN) <span class="yellow">virus</span> from <span class="yellow">Japanese encephalitis virus</span> infections in horses: effects of <span class="yellow">WN virus</span> NS1 antibodies induced by inactivated <span class="yellow">WN</span> vaccine. 

Antibodies to non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of <span class="yellow">West Nile virus</span> (WNV) have been used to differentiate <span class="yellow">WNV</span> infection from infection by serologically cross-reactive flaviviruses, including <span class="yellow">Japanese encephalitis virus</span> (JEV), in <span class="red">horses</span>. However, since the inactivated <span class="yellow">West Nile</span> (<span class="yellow">WN</span>) vaccine has been reported to induce NS1 antibodies, there is concern about the reliability of using NS1-based assays for testing vaccinated <span class="red">horses</span>. Therefore, the effect of inactivated <span class="yellow">WN</span> vaccine-induced antibodies on an epitope-blocking ELISA and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) assay were investigated. Both assays are based on NS1 antibodies and were established previously to differentiate <span class="yellow">WNV</span> from <span class="yellow">JEV</span> infections in <span class="red">horses</span>. Groups of three <span class="red">horses</span> were vaccinated with two or three doses of a commercial inactivated <span class="yellow">WN</span> vaccine and NS1 antibodies were detected by a conventional ELISA after the second vaccination. Vaccine-induced NS1 antibodies were also detected by blocking ELISA and a CDC assay and affected the ability of these assays to differentiate <span class="yellow">WNV</span> from <span class="yellow">JEV</span> infections. However, the effect was less significant in the CDC assay, where use of a low serum concentration ensured effective differentiation. The more efficient detection of infection-induced antibodies over vaccine-induced antibodies by the CDC assay was potentially attributable to the different IgG isotype profiles of these antibodies.
