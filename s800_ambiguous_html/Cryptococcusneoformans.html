<h2>Cryptococcus neoformans</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20044015</h3>Characterizing the role of the microtubule binding protein Bim1 in <span class="blue">Cryptococcus neoformans</span>. 

During sexual development the <span class="yellow">human</span> <span class="yellow">fungal</span> pathogen <span class="blue">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> undergoes a developmental transition from yeast-form growth to filamentous growth. This transition requires cellular restructuring to form a filamentous dikaryon. Dikaryotic growth also requires tightly controlled nuclear migration to ensure faithful replication and dissemination of genetic material to spore progeny. Although the gross morphological changes that take place during dikaryotic growth are largely known, the molecular underpinnings that control this process are uncharacterized. Here we identify and characterize a <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span> homolog of the <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> BIM1 gene, and establish the importance of BIM1 for proper filamentous growth of <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span>. Deletion of BIM1 leads to truncated sexual development filaments, a severe defect in diploid formation, and a block in monokaryotic fruiting. Our findings lead to a model consistent with a critical role for BIM1 in both filament integrity and nuclear congression that is mediated through the microtubule cytoskeleton. 
<h3>20719250</h3>Regulation of virulence factors, carbon utilization and virulence by SNF1 in <span class="yellow">Cryptococcus neoformans JEC21</span> and divergent actions of SNF1 between cryptococcal strains. 

We describe here the functions of a Snf1/AMPK homolog in the <span class="yellow">human</span> pathogenic <span class="yellow">yeast</span> <span class="red">Cryptococcus neoformans</span>, strain <span class="yellow">JEC21</span>. We found that <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1 is a key regulator for the biosynthesis of the major virulence factors, stress resistance and alternative carbon source utilization. Disruption of <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1 results in defects of laccase activity and capsule production, sensitivity to cation stress. Especially, we found that <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1 is essential for growth at elevated temperature and for thermotolerance. To our knowledge, a role for Snf1 proteins in thermotolerance has not been reported. Furthermore, we observed a functional divergence between <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1 and its equivalent from <span class="yellow">serotype A</span><span class="yellow">A</span> strain <span class="yellow">H99</span>. <span class="yellow">A</span> high temperature is needed for <span class="yellow">H99</span> SNF1 to function in stress response and carbon source preference, but not for the <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1. Our results confirmed a critical role of <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1 in regulation of stress response and virulence. Revelation of divergent actions of SNF1 may help to understand the evolution of cryptococcal pathogenesis and provides insights into the strain-associated biosynthesis of virulence factors. 
<h3>20971202</h3>Ste50 adaptor protein governs sexual differentiation of <span class="blue">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> via the pheromone-response MAPK signaling pathway. 

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways control diverse cellular functions in pathogenic fungi, including sexual differentiation, stress response, and maintenance of cell wall integrity. Here we characterized a <span class="blue">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> gene, which is homologous to the <span class="yellow">yeast</span> Ste50 that is known to play an important role in mating pheromone response and stress response as an adaptor protein to the Ste11 MAPK kinase kinase in <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>. The <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span> Ste50 was not involved in any of the stress responses or virulence factor production (capsule and melanin) that are controlled by the HOG and Ras/cAMP signaling pathways. However, Ste50 was required for mating in both <span class="yellow">serotype A</span> and <span class="yellow">serotype D C. neoformans</span> strains. The ste50Delta mutant was completely defective in cell-cell fusion and mating pheromone production. Double mutation of the STE50 gene blocked increased production of pheromone and the hyper-filamentation phenotype of cells deleted of the CRG1 gene, which encodes the RGS protein that negatively regulates pheromone responsive G-protein signaling via the MAPK pathway. Regardless of the presence of the basidiomycota-specific SH3 domains of Ste50 that are known to be required for full virulence of <span class="yellow">Ustilago maydis</span>, Ste50 was dispensable for virulence of <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span> in a murine model of cryptococcosis. In conclusion, the Ste50 adaptor protein controls sexual differentiation of <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span> via the pheromone-responsive MAPK pathway but is not required for virulence. 
<h3>21111055</h3>Mating differentiation in <span class="blue">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> is negatively regulated by the Crk1 protein kinase. 

<span class="blue">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> is a heterothallic basidiomycete that grows vegetatively as <span class="yellow">yeast</span> and filamentous hyphae are produced in the sexual state. Previous studies have shown that <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span> Cwc1 and Cwc2 are two central photoregulators which form a complex to inhibit the production of sexual filaments upon light treatment. To reveal the detailed regulatory mechanisms, a genome wide mutagenesis screen was conducted and components in the Cwc1/Cwc2 complex mediated pathway have been identified. In this study, one suppressor mutant, DJ22, is characterized and T-DNA is found to disrupt the <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span> CRK1 gene, a homologue of <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> IME2 and <span class="yellow">Ustilago maydis</span> crk1. Ime2 is a meiosis-specific gene with the conserved Ser/Thr kinase domain and TXY dual phosphorylation site. Consistent with the findings of other suppressors in our screen, <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span> Crk1 plays a negative role in the mating process. Dikaryotic filaments, basidia, and basidiospores are produced earlier in the crk1 mutant crosses and mating efficiency is also increased. Artificial elevation of the CRK1 mRNA level inhibits mating. Interestingly, monokaryotic fruiting is defective both in the MATalpha crk1 mutant and CRK1 overexpression strains. Our studies demonstrate that <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span> CRK1 gene functions as a negative regulator in the mating differentiation. 
<h3>21320625</h3>Mechanisms of unisexual mating in <span class="blue">Cryptococcus neoformans</span>.

Sex serves a pivotal role in genetic exchange and it contributes to the fitness and genetic diversity for eukaryotic populations. Although the importance of the canonical bisexual mating has been widely accepted, the significance of the evolution and maintenance of unisexual mating observed in some eukaryotes is unclear. The recent discovery of same-sex mating in the <span class="yellow">human</span> <span class="yellow">fungal</span> pathogen <span class="blue">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> and the revelation of its impact on the Cryptococcus global population structure provide a platform to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and significance of unisexual mating. Here, we review the evidence of unisexual mating in Cryptococcus and provide some perspective on the biological significance of this life style on the survival of this important <span class="yellow">fungal</span> pathogen in the environment and in animal hosts. We also summarize our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing this unconventional mode of reproduction. 
<h3>21067947</h3>Characterizing the role of RNA silencing components in <span class="blue">Cryptococcus neoformans</span>. 

The RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by homology-dependent degradation of the target mRNA with small RNA molecules plays a key role in controlling transcription and translation processes in a number of eukaryotic organisms. The RNAi machinery is also evolutionarily conserved in a wide variety of <span class="yellow">fungal</span> species, including pathogenic fungi. To elucidate the physiological functions of the RNAi pathway in <span class="blue">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> that causes <span class="yellow">fungal</span> meningitis, here we performed genetic analyses for genes encoding Argonaute (AGO1 and AGO2), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDP1), and Dicers (DCR1 and DCR2) in both <span class="yellow">serotype A</span><span class="yellow">A</span> and D <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span>. The present study shows that Ago1, Rdp1, and Dcr2 are the major components of the RNAi process occurring in <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span>. However, the RNAi machinery is not involved in regulation of production of two virulence factors (capsule and melanin), sexual differentiation, and diverse stress response. Comparative transcriptome analysis of the <span class="yellow">serotype A</span><span class="yellow">A</span> and D RNAi mutants revealed that only modest changes occur in the genome-wide transcriptome profiles when the RNAi process was perturbed. Notably, the serotype D rdp1Delta mutants showed an increase in transcript abundance of active retrotransposons and transposons, such as T2 and T3, the latter of which is a novel serotype D-specific transposon of <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span>. In a wild type background both T2 and T3 were found to be weakly active mobile elements, although we found no evidence of Cnl1 retrotransposon mobility. In contrast, all three transposable elements exhibited enhanced mobility in the rdp1Delta mutant strain. In conclusion, the RNAi pathway plays an important role in controlling transposon activity and genome integrity of <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span>.
