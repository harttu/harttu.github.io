<h2>ATMT0225B6</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21600998</h3>The cell cycle gene MoCDC15 regulates hyphal growth, asexual development and plant infection in the <span class="yellow">rice blast pathogen</span> <span class="yellow">Magnaporthe oryzae</span>. 

Rice blast, caused by the pathogen <span class="yellow">Magnaporthe oryzae</span>, is a serious hindrance to <span class="yellow">rice</span> production and has emerged as an important model for the characterization of molecular mechanisms relevant to pathogenic development in plants. Similar to other pathogenic fungi, conidiation plays a central role in initiation of <span class="yellow">M.oryzae</span> infection and spread over a large area. However, relatively little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms that underlie conidiation in <span class="yellow">M. oryzae</span>. To better characterize these mechanisms, we identified a conidiation-defective mutant, <span class="blue">ATMT0225B6</span> (<span class="yellow">MoCDC15(T-DNA)</span>), in which a T-DNA insertion disrupted a gene that encodes a homolog of fission <span class="yellow">yeast</span> cdc15, and generated a second strain containing a disruption in the same allele (DeltaMoCDC15(T-DNA)). The cdc15 gene has been shown to act as a coordinator of the cell cycle in <span class="yellow">yeast</span>. Functional analysis of the <span class="yellow">MoCDC15(T-DNA)</span> and DeltaMoCDC15(T-DNA) mutants revealed that MoCDC15 is required for conidiation, preinfection development and pathogenicity in <span class="yellow">M. oryzae</span>. Conidia from these mutants were viable, but failed to adhere to hydrophobic surface, a crucial step required for subsequent pathogenic development. All phenotypic defects observed in mutants were rescued in a strain complemented with <span class="yellow">wild type MoCDC15</span>. Together, these data indicate that MoCDC15 functions as a coordinator of several biological processes important for pathogenic development in <span class="yellow">M. oryzae</span>.
