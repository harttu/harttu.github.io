<h2>patients</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20580606</h3>Treatment non-adherence in teenage and young adult <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with cancer.<br><br>Adhering to treatment can be a significant issue for many <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> diagnosed with chronic health conditions and this has been reported to be greater during the adolescent years. However, little is known about treatment adherence in teenage and young adult (TYA) <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with cancer. To increase awareness of the adherence challenges faced by these <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span>, we have reviewed the published work. The available evidence suggests that a substantial proportion of TYA <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with cancer do have difficulties, with reports that up to 63% of <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> do not adhere to their treatment regimens. However, with inconsistent findings across studies, the true extent of non-adherence for these young <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> is still unclear. Furthermore, it is apparent that there are many components of the cancer treatment regimen that have yet to be assessed in relation to <span class="linneaus_only ">patient</span> adherence. Factors that have been shown to affect treatment adherence in TYA <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> include <span class="linneaus_only ">patient</span> emotional functioning (depression and self-esteem), <span class="linneaus_only ">patient</span> health beliefs (perceived illness severity and vulnerability), and family environment (parental support and parent-child concordance). Strategies that foster greater <span class="linneaus_only ">patient</span> adherence are also identified. These strategies are multifactorial, targeting not only the <span class="linneaus_only ">patient</span>, but the health professional, family, and treatment regimen. This review highlights the lack of interventional studies addressing treatment adherence in TYA <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with cancer, with only one such intervention being identified: a video game intervention focusing on behavioural issues related to cancer treatment and care. Methodological issues in measuring adherence are addressed and suggestions for improving the design of future adherence studies highlighted, of which there is a great need. 
<h3>20719377</h3>Gout therapeutics: new drugs for an old disease.<br><br>The approval of febuxostat, a non-purine-analogue inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, by the European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration heralds a new era in the treatment of gout. The use of modified uricases to rapidly reduce serum urate concentrations in <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with otherwise untreatable gout is progressing. Additionally, advances in our understanding of the transport of uric acid in the renal proximal tubule and the inflammatory response to monosodium urate crystals are translating into potential new treatments. In this Review, we focus on the clinical trials of febuxostat. We also review results from studies of pegloticase, a pegylated uricase in development, and we summarise data for several other pipeline drugs for gout, such as the selective uricosuric drug RDEA594 and various interleukin-1 inhibitors. Finally, we issue a word of caution about the proper use of the new drugs and the already available drugs for gout. At a time of important advances, we need to recommit ourselves to a rational approach to the treatment of gout. 
<h3>20869315</h3>Drug interactions in childhood cancer.<br><br>Children with cancer are increasingly benefiting from new treatment strategies and advances in supportive care, as shown by improvements in both survival and quality-of-life. However, the continuous emergence of new cancer drugs and supportive-care drugs has increased the possibility of harmful drug interactions; health-care providers need to be very cautious when combining drugs. We discuss the most common interactions between chemotherapeutic drugs and supportive-care drugs-such as anticonvulsants, antiemetics, uric-acid-lowering compounds, acid suppressants, antimicrobials, and pain-management medications in paediatric <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span>. We also review the interactions between chemotherapy drugs and food and herbal supplements, and provide recommendations to avoid unwanted and potentially fatal interactions in <span class="linneaus_only ">children</span> with cancer. Because of the constant release of new drugs, health-care providers need to check the most recent references before making recommendations about drug interactions. 
<h3>20962085</h3>Novel F141L pre-S2 mutation in <span class="annotated ">hepatitis B virus</span> increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with chronic genotype C infections. <br><br>Several lines of evidence have suggested that some naturally occurring mutations of <span class="annotated ">hepatitis B virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">HBV</span>) play a critical role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we describe a novel HCC-related pre-S2 mutation, F141L. To prove the relationship between the F141L mutation and HCC, molecular epidemiology studies using MboII PCR restriction analysis (PRA) were performed, and the molecular mechanism was investigated through construction of a stable hepatocyte cell line expressing the large surface HB protein (LHB) with the F141L mutation (F141L-LHB). Application of MboII PRA to samples from 241 Korean <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with chronic liver diseases of different clinical stages confirmed that F141L mutants were significantly related to HCC, even in comparison to liver cirrhosis (HCC, 26.3% of <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span>, or 26/99; liver cirrhosis, 3.8% of <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span>, or 2/52; P = 0.001). By studying stable cell lines, we found that F141L-LHBs could induce cell cycle progression by downregulating the p53 and p21 pathways and upregulating CDK4 and cyclin <span class="unannotated ">A</span>. Furthermore, we found that in a colony-forming assay, the colony-forming rates in cell lines expressing F141L-LHBs were about twice as high as those of the wild type. In conclusion, our results suggest that F141L-LHBs may contribute importantly to the pathogenesis of HCC by inducing cell proliferation and transformation. So, the F141L mutation examined in this study could serve as a diagnostic marker for the prognosis of HCC. 
<h3>20962099</h3>Replicative and transcriptional activities of <span class="annotated ">hepatitis B virus</span> in <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> coinfected with <span class="annotated ">hepatitis B</span> and <span class="annotated ">hepatitis delta viruses</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Hepatitis B virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">HBV</span>) and <span class="annotated ">hepatitis delta virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">HDV</span>) interplay was investigated by examining liver and serum samples from 21 coinfected and 22 <span class="annotated ">HBV</span>-monoinfected <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with chronic liver disease. Different real-time PCR assays were applied to evaluate intrahepatic amounts of <span class="annotated ">HBV</span> DNA, covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), pregenomic RNA (pgRNA), pre-S/S RNAs, and <span class="annotated ">HDV</span> RNA. Besides <span class="annotated ">HBV</span> DNA and <span class="annotated ">HDV</span> RNA levels, HBsAg concentrations in the sera were also determined. <span class="annotated ">HDV</span>-coinfected cases showed significantly lower median levels of serum <span class="annotated ">HBV</span> DNA (-5 log), intrahepatic relaxed-circular DNA (-2 log), and cccDNA (-2 log) than those of <span class="annotated ">HBV</span>-monoinfected cases. Interestingly, pgRNA and pre-S/S RNA amounts were significantly lower (both -1 log) in <span class="annotated ">HDV</span>-positive <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span>, whereas serum HBsAg concentrations were comparable between the two <span class="linneaus_only ">patient</span> groups. Pre-S/S RNA and HBsAg amounts per cccDNA molecule were higher in <span class="annotated ">HDV</span>-positive <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> (3-fold and 1 log, respectively), showing that <span class="annotated ">HBV</span> replication was reduced, whereas synthesis of envelope proteins was not specifically decreased. The ratios of cccDNA to intracellular total <span class="annotated ">HBV</span> DNA showed a larger proportion of cccDNA molecules in <span class="annotated ">HDV</span>-positive cases. For these <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span>, both intrahepatic and serum <span class="annotated ">HDV</span> RNA amounts were associated with cccDNA but not with HBsAg or <span class="unannotated ">HBV</span> DNA levels. Finally, <span class="unannotated ">HBV</span> genomes with large deletions in the basal core promoter/precore region were detected in 5/21 <span class="annotated ">HDV</span>-positive <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> but in no <span class="annotated ">HDV</span>-negative <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> and were associated with lower viremia levels. These findings provide significant information about the interference exerted by <span class="unannotated ">HDV</span> on <span class="annotated ">HBV</span> replication and transcription activities in the <span class="annotated ">human</span> liver. 
<h3>20970457</h3>Development of an IgM-capture ELISA for <span class="annotated ">Coxsackievirus A16</span> infection.<br><br>Diagnosis of <span class="annotated ">Coxsackievirus A16</span> (<span class="annotated ">CA16</span>) infection in China relies mainly on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that require expensive equipment and special trained personnel, thus making its wide application in health care settings unlikely. In this study, a novel IgM anti-<span class="annotated ">CA16</span> assay was developed for the detection of IgM antibodies to <span class="annotated ">CA16</span> in serum. The responses and diagnostic value of IgM for the <span class="annotated ">CA16</span> infection were assessed by testing 1970 serum samples. The results showed that sensitivity of IgM test was 84.6% (259/306, 95% CI: 80.1-88.5), and specificity in control subjects and <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with <span class="annotated ">CA16</span> HFMD was 99.2% (1508/1520, 95% CI: 98.6-99.6) and 90.3% (14/144, 95% CI: 84.2-94.6), respectively. The IgM positive rate reached 56.3% in the sera collected within the first day after onset, increased continuously to 95.3% at day 5 to day 7 after onset, and then reached 100% after more than 8 days. The cross-reaction rate in <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> infected with other non-<span class="annotated ">CA16</span> enteroviruses was 9.7% (14/144). These results suggest that the IgM anti-<span class="annotated ">CA16</span> assay offers a rapid, convenient, and reliable method to detect acute <span class="annotated ">CA16</span> infections. 
<h3>20980500</h3>Differential regulation of <span class="annotated ">human papillomavirus type 8</span> by interferon regulatory factors 3 and 7. <br><br>The genus <span class="annotated ">Beta human papillomavirus (HPV) type 8</span> is associated with nonmelanoma skin cancer in <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with epidermodysplasia verruciformis, and evidence for its protumorigenic potential in the general population increases. To date, strategies to suppress <span class="annotated ">genus Beta HPV</span> infections are limited. Interferon regulatory factors IRF-3 and IRF-7 play key roles in the activation of the innate immune response to <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> infections. In this study, we show for the first time that both IRF-3 and IRF-7 regulate transcription of a papillomavirus, but with opposing effects. IRF-7, expressed in the suprabasal layers of <span class="annotated ">human</span> epidermis, increased <span class="annotated ">HPV8</span> late promoter activity via direct binding to <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> DNA. UV-B light-induced activation of the <span class="annotated ">HPV8</span> promoter involved IRF-7 as a downstream effector. In contrast, IRF-3, expressed in all layers of <span class="annotated ">human</span> epidermis, induced strong <span class="annotated ">HPV8</span> suppression in primary keratinocytes. IRF-3-mediated suppression prevailed over IRF-7-induced <span class="annotated ">HPV8</span> transcription. Unlike the E6 oncoprotein of the mucosal high-risk <span class="annotated ">HPV16</span>, the <span class="annotated ">HPV8</span> E6 protein did not bind to IRF-3 and only weakly antagonized its activity. Strong antiviral activity was also observed, when keratinocytes were treated with potent IRF-3 activators, poly(I:C) or RNA bearing 5' phosphates. In conclusion, we show that IRF-3 activation induces a state of cell-autonomous immunity against HPV in primary <span class="annotated ">human</span> keratinocytes. Our study suggests that local application of IRF-3-activating compounds might constitute an attractive novel therapeutic strategy against <span class="annotated ">HPV8</span>-associated diseases, particularly in epidermodysplasia verruciformis <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span>. 
<h3>21029749</h3>Double-antigen sandwich ELISA for the detection of anti-<span class="annotated ">hepatitis C virus</span> antibodies. <br><br>A double-antigen sandwich ELISA was developed a detection of <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> antibodies by a recombinant multi-epitope <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> antigen and a biotin-streptavidin amplification system. Three plasma specimens from 1708 individuals who were suspected previously to be <span class="annotated ">HCV</span>-positive using an <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> antibody diagnostic kit (Chuangxin, Xiamen, China) displayed negative results when using the ELISA. These results were validated by a recombinant immunoblotting assay (two were negative, and one was indeterminate). Among 889 blood specimens donated for clinical evaluation, 246 were positive and 630 were negative using the ELISA. The sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA were 98.7% and 100%, respectively. In 43 donors and 14 <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with chronic hepatitis C, the detectable rates for <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> IgM by both ELISA and the <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> anti-IgM detection reagents (Huimin, Shenyang, China) were 100%, and the detectable rate for <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> IgG using an indirect <span class="annotated ">HCV</span>-antibody detection kit (GWK, Beijing, China) was 98.3%. Thus, the double-antigen sandwich ELISA exhibits strong specificity and sensitivity and has been approved by the China State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA). The performance of the double-antigen sandwich ELISA was similar to the Ortho ELISA 3.0. It did not give false-negative results otherwise IgM was undetectable using an indirect <span class="annotated ">HCV</span>-antibody detection kit. This ELISA provides another method for the detection of <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> antibodies. 
<h3>21034775</h3>Cross-genotypic polyclonal anti-<span class="annotated ">HCV</span> antibodies from <span class="annotated ">human</span> ascitic fluid.<br><br>Many anti-<span class="annotated ">HCV</span> antibodies are available, but more are needed for research and clinical applications. This study examines whether ascitic fluid from cirrhotic <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> could be a source of reagent-grade antibodies. Ascitic fluid from 29 <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> was screened by ELISA for anti-<span class="annotated ">HCV</span> antibodies against three <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> proteins: core, NS4B, and NS5A. Significant patient-to-patient variability in anti-<span class="annotated ">HCV</span> antibody titers was observed. Total ascitic fluid IgG purified by Protein-A chromatography reacted with <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> proteins in immunoblots, cell extracts, and replicon-expressing cells. Affinity-purification using synthetic peptides as bait allowed the preparation of cross-genotypic antibodies directed against pre-selected regions of <span class="unannotated ">HCV</span> core, NS4B, and NS5A proteins. The performance of the polyclonal antibodies was comparable to that of monoclonal antibodies. Anti-NS4B antibody preparations reacted with genotype 1a, 1b, and 2a NS4B proteins in immunoblots and allowed NS4B to be localized in replicon-expressing cells. Ascitic fluid is an abundant source of <span class="annotated ">human</span> polyclonal cross-genotypic antibodies that can be used as an alternative to blood. This study shows the utility of selectively purifying <span class="annotated ">human</span> polyclonal antibodies from ascitic fluid. Affinity purification allows antibodies to be selected that are comparable to monoclonal antibodies in their ability to react with targeted regions of <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> proteins. 
<h3>21034776</h3>A versatile vector for the production of pseudotyped viruses expressing gp120 antigens from different clades of primary <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> isolates. <br><br>A novel <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> Env expression vector (SF162-Z) was developed by introducing two new cloning sites on the backbone of an existing vector that produces a full length Env from <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> SF162 isolate. These sites facilitate the swapping of the gp120 portion of the SF162 Env with matching gp120 antigens from <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> isolates of different genetic clades. Final production of functional pseudotyped viruses will express chimeric Env antigens, including gp41 of the parental SF162 and gp120 from other primary isolates. This system is useful for testing the neutralizing sensitivity of partial env gene products frequently identified in <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> quasi species in <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> infected with <span class="annotated ">HIV</span> or when only partial gp120 gene products are available. 
<h3>21147032</h3>Systemic therapy in the management of metastatic or locally recurrent adenoid cystic carcinoma of the salivary glands: a systematic review. <br><br>Adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACC) are rare cancers usually arising in the salivary glands. Once metastatic, the natural history can vary; some <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with indolent cancer remain asymptomatic for long periods, whereas others have rapidly progressive disease. Chemotherapy is generally reserved for the palliative treatment of symptomatic locally recurrent or metastatic disease that is not amenable to further surgery or radiation. Prospective trials of chemotherapy in advanced ACC are limited, and the optimum regimen is unclear. The aim of this systematic review is to summarise and rate the quality of trials assessing chemotherapy for treatment of ACC, by use of the European Lung Cancer Working Party scoring system. Endpoints evaluated include tumour response and rates of symptomatic improvement. 34 trials involving 441 <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> are included. We give evidence-based recommendations for management of ACC with chemotherapy, along with considerations for the design of future clinical trials in this disease. 
<h3>21147039</h3>Behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia: diagnosis, clinical staging, and management. <br><br>Patients with behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) present with insidious changes in personality and interpersonal conduct that indicate progressive disintegration of the neural circuits involved in social cognition, emotion regulation, motivation, and decision making. The underlying pathological changes are heterogeneous and are characterised by various intraneuronal inclusions. Biomarkers to detect these histopathological changes in life are becoming increasingly important with the development of disease-modifying drugs. Gene mutations have been found that collectively account for around 10-20% of cases. Recently, criteria proposed for bvFTD define three levels of diagnostic certainty: possible, probable, and definite. Detailed history taking from family members to elicit behavioural features underpins the diagnostic process, with support from neuropsychological testing designed to detect impairment in decision making, emotion processing, and social cognition. Brain imaging is important for increasing the level of diagnostic certainty. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> recently developed staging instrument shows much promise for monitoring <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> and evaluating therapies, which at present are aimed at symptom amelioration. Carer education and support remain of paramount importance. 
<h3>21163445</h3>Clinical experience and laboratory investigations in <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. <br><br>Since its discovery in 2007, the encephalitis associated with antibodies against the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) has entered the mainstream of neurology and other disciplines. Most <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with anti-NMDAR encephalitis develop a multistage illness that progresses from psychosis, memory deficits, seizures, and language disintegration into a state of unresponsiveness with catatonic features often associated with abnormal movements, and autonomic and breathing instability. The disorder predominantly affects <span class="linneaus_only ">children</span> and young adults, occurs with or without tumour association, and responds to treatment but can relapse. The presence of a tumour (usually an ovarian teratoma) is dependent on age, sex, and ethnicity, being more frequent in <span class="linneaus_only ">women</span> older than 18 years, and slightly more predominant in <span class="unannotated ">black</span> <span class="linneaus_only ">women</span> than it is in white <span class="linneaus_only ">women</span>. <span class="linneaus_only ">Patients</span> treated with tumour resection and immunotherapy (corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, or plasma exchange) respond faster to treatment and less frequently need second-line immunotherapy (cyclophosphamide or rituximab, or both) than do <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> without a tumour who receive similar initial immunotherapy. More than 75% of all <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> have substantial recovery that occurs in inverse order of symptom development and is associated with a decline of antibody titres. Patients' antibodies cause a titre-dependent, reversible decrease of synaptic NMDAR by a mechanism of crosslinking and internalisation. On the basis of models of pharmacological or genetic disruption of NMDAR, these antibody effects reveal a probable pathogenic relation between the depletion of receptors and the clinical features of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. 
<h3>21163702</h3>The ribonucleotide reductase large subunit (RRM1) as a predictive factor in <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with cancer. <br><br>The large subunit of <span class="annotated ">human</span> ribonucleotide reductase, RRM1, is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, cell migration, tumour and metastasis development, and the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides for DNA synthesis. It is also a cellular target for the chemotherapeutic agent, gemcitabine. RRM1 has been studied in a large number of <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with different types of cancer, such as non-small-cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and biliary tract cancer, to establish its prognostic or predictive value when <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> were treated with gemcitabine, and mRNA expression and genetic variants as determined by genotyping have in some cases been associated with clinical outcome of <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with cancer. Here, we review preclinical and clinical studies of RRM1 assessment and discuss the further steps in the development of this clinically pertinent biomarker. 
<h3>21169488</h3>The sensor kinase CbrA is a global regulator that modulates metabolism, virulence, and antibiotic resistance in <span class="annotated ">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> is an opportunistic pathogen that possesses a large arsenal of virulence factors enabling the pathogen to cause serious infections in immunocompromised <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span>, burn victims, and cystic fibrosis <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span>. CbrA is a sensor kinase that has previously been implied to play a role with its cognate response regulator CbrB in the metabolic regulation of carbon and nitrogen utilization in <span class="annotated ">P. aeruginosa</span>. Here it is demonstrated that CbrA and CbrB play an important role in various virulence and virulence-related processes of the bacteria, including swarming, biofilm formation, cytotoxicity, and antibiotic resistance. The cbrA deletion mutant was completely unable to swarm while exhibiting an increase in biofilm formation, supporting the inverse regulation of swarming and biofilm formation in <span class="annotated ">P. aeruginosa</span>. The cbrA mutant also exhibited increased cytotoxicity to <span class="annotated ">human</span> lung epithelial cells as early as 4 and 6 h postinfection. Furthermore, the cbrA mutant demonstrated increased resistance toward a variety of clinically important antibiotics, including polymyxin B, ciprofloxacin, and tobramycin. Microarray analysis revealed that under swarming conditions, CbrA regulated the expression of many genes, including phoPQ, pmrAB, arnBCADTEF, dnaK, and pvdQ, consistent with the antibiotic resistance and swarming impairment phenotypes of the cbrA mutant. Phenotypic and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analyses of a PA14 cbrB mutant suggested that CbrA may be modulating swarming, biofilm formation, and cytotoxicity via CbrB and that the CrcZ small RNA is likely downstream of this two-component regulator. However, as CbrB did not have a resistance phenotype, CbrA likely modulates antibiotic resistance in a manner independent of CbrB. 
<h3>21185234</h3>Early-onset versus late-onset Alzheimer's disease: the case of the missing APOE epsilo4 allele. <br><br>Some <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) present with a distinct phenotype. Typically, the first and most salient characteristic of AD is episodic memory impairment. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> few <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span>, however, present with focal cortical, non-memory symptoms, such as difficulties with language, visuospatial, or executive functions. These presentations are associated with specific patterns of atrophy and frequently with a young age at onset. Age is not, however, the only determinant of phenotype; underlying factors, especially genetic factors, seem also to affect phenotype and predispose <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> to younger or older age at onset. Importantly, <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with atypical early-onset disease seldom carry the APOE epsilo4 allele, which is the most important risk factor for lowering the age of onset in <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with AD. Additionally, theAPOE epsilo4 genotype seems to predispose <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> to vulnerability in the medial temporal areas, which leads to memory loss. Conversely, <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> negative for the APOE epsilo4 allele and with early-onset AD are more likely to be predisposed to vulnerability of cerebral networks beyond the medial temporal lobes. Other factors are probably involved in determining the pattern of atrophy, but these are currently unknown. 
<h3>21195251</h3>Borderline personality disorder.<br><br>Recent research findings have contributed to an improved understanding and treatment of borderline personality disorder. This disorder is characterised by severe functional impairments, a high risk of suicide, a negative effect on the course of depressive disorders, extensive use of treatment, and high costs to society. The course of this disorder is less stable than expected for personality disorders. The causes are not yet clear, but genetic factors and adverse life events seem to interact to lead to the disorder. Neurobiological research suggests that abnormalities in the frontolimbic networks are associated with many of the symptoms. Data for the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy vary and evidence is not yet robust. Specific forms of psychotherapy seem to be beneficial for at least some of the problems frequently reported in <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with borderline personality disorder. At present, there is no evidence to suggest that one specific form of psychotherapy is more effective than another. Further research is needed on the diagnosis, neurobiology, and treatment of borderline personality disorder. 
<h3>21215883</h3>Decompression illness.<br><br>Decompression illness is caused by intravascular or extravascular bubbles that are formed as a result of reduction in environmental pressure (decompression). The term covers both arterial gas embolism, in which alveolar gas or venous gas emboli (via cardiac shunts or via pulmonary vessels) are introduced into the arterial circulation, and decompression sickness, which is caused by in-situ bubble formation from dissolved inert gas. Both syndromes can occur in divers, compressed air workers, aviators, and astronauts, but arterial gas embolism also arises from iatrogenic causes unrelated to decompression. Risk of decompression illness is affected by immersion, exercise, and heat or cold. Manifestations range from itching and minor pain to neurological symptoms, cardiac collapse, and death. First-aid treatment is 100% oxygen and definitive treatment is recompression to increased pressure, breathing 100% oxygen. Adjunctive treatment, including fluid administration and prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism in paralysed <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span>, is also recommended. Treatment is, in most cases, effective although residual deficits can remain in serious cases, even after several recompressions. 
<h3>21256454</h3>Treatment of <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with essential tremor.<br><br>Essential tremor is a common movement disorder. Tremor severity and handicap vary widely, but most <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with essential tremor do not receive a diagnosis and hence are never treated. Furthermore, many <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> abandon treatment because of side-effects or poor efficacy. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> newly developed algorithm, based on the logarithmic relation between tremor amplitude and clinical tremor ratings, can be used to compare the magnitude of effect of available treatments. Drugs with established efficacy (propranolol and primidone) produce a mean tremor reduction of about 50%. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the thalamic nucleus ventrointermedius or neighbouring subthalamic structures reduces tremor by about 90%. However, no controlled trials of DBS have been done, and the best target is still uncertain. Better drugs are needed, and controlled trials are required to determine the safety and efficacy of DBS in the nucleus ventrointermedius and neighbouring subthalamic structures. 
<h3>21269674</h3><span class="annotated ">Human</span> resources for health in southeast Asia: shortages, distributional challenges, and international trade in health services. <br><br>In this paper, we address the issues of shortage and maldistribution of health personnel in southeast Asia in the context of the international trade in health services. Although there is no shortage of health workers in the region overall, when analysed separately, five low-income countries have some deficit. All countries in southeast Asia face problems of maldistribution of health workers, and rural areas are often understaffed. Despite a high capacity for medical and nursing training in both public and private facilities, there is weak coordination between production of health workers and capacity for employment. Regional experiences and policy responses to address these challenges can be used to inform future policy in the region and elsewhere. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> distinctive feature of southeast Asia is its engagement in international trade in health services. Singapore and Malaysia import health workers to meet domestic demand and to provide services to international <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span>. Thailand attracts many foreign <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> for health services. This situation has resulted in the so-called brain drain of highly specialised staff from public medical schools to the private hospitals. The Philippines and Indonesia are the main exporters of doctors and nurses in the region. Agreements about mutual recognition of professional qualifications for three groups of health workers under the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Framework Agreement on Services could result in increased movement within the region in the future. To ensure that vital <span class="annotated ">human</span> resources for health are available to meet the needs of the populations that they serve, migration management and retention strategies need to be integrated into ongoing efforts to strengthen health systems in southeast Asia. There is also a need for improved dialogue between the health and trade sectors on how to balance economic opportunities associated with trade in health services with domestic health needs and equity issues. 
<h3>21272794</h3>Emerging opportunistic <span class="unannotated ">yeast</span> infections.<br><br>A growing population of immunosuppressed <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> has resulted in increasingly frequent diagnoses of invasive <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> infections, including those caused by unusual <span class="unannotated ">yeasts</span>. The incidence of non-albicans species of Candida is increasing compared with that of <span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span>, and several species, such as <span class="annotated ">Candida glabrata</span> and <span class="annotated ">Candida krusei</span>, may be resistant to azole antifungal therapy. Trichosporon species are the second most common cause of fungaemia in <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with haematological malignant disease and are characterised by resistance to amphotericin and echinocandins and poor prognosis. Rhodotorula species belong to the family Cryptococcaceae, and are a cause of catheter-related fungaemia, sepsis, and invasive disease in severely immunosuppressed <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span>. An increasing number of sporadic cases of invasive <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> infections by non-neoformans cryptococci have been reported in immunocompromised hosts, especially for <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with advanced <span class="annotated ">HIV</span> infection or cancer who are undergoing transplant. Other uncommon <span class="unannotated ">yeasts</span> that can cause invasive disease in severely immunosuppressed <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> include Geotrichum, Hansenula, Malassezia, and Saccharomyces. Host immune status is a crucial determinant of the type of invasive <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> infection a <span class="linneaus_only ">patient</span> is at risk for. Diagnosis can be challenging and relies heavily on traditional cultures of blood and other sterile sites, although serum (1,3)-Beta-D-glucan testing might have an adjunctive role. Although rare <span class="unannotated ">yeasts</span> are emerging as opportunistic <span class="annotated ">human</span> pathogens, diagnosis remains challenging and treatment suboptimal. 
<h3>21276754</h3>Management of uncommon chemotherapy-induced emergencies.<br><br>Chemotherapy can induce various clinical emergencies. Prompt recognition and management of these adverse events are important for avoiding further morbidity and mortality. Some events such as hypersensitivity and extravasation are quite common, whereas emergencies such as neutropenic typhlitis, pancreatitis, and acute haemolysis are very rare. Little information exists on the management of rare chemotherapy-induced emergencies that affect fewer than 1% of <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span>. We review these uncommon chemotherapy-induced life-threatening emergencies, their pathogenesis and management, and recommendations for rechallenge with the offending chemotherapy. 
<h3>21277552</h3>New driver mutations in non-small-cell lung cancer.<br><br>Treatment decisions for <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with lung cancer have historically been based on tumour histology. Some understanding of the molecular composition of tumours has led to the development of targeted agents, for which initial findings are promising. Clearer understanding of mutations in relevant genes and their effects on cancer cell proliferation and survival, is, therefore, of substantial interest. We review current knowledge about molecular subsets in non-small-cell lung cancer that have been identified as potentially having clinical relevance to targeted therapies. Since mutations in EGFR and KRAS have been extensively reviewed elsewhere, here, we discuss subsets defined by so-called driver mutations in ALK, HER2 (also known as ERBB2), BRAF, PIK3CA, AKT1, MAP2K1, and MET. The adoption of treatment tailored according to the genetic make-up of individual tumours would involve a paradigm shift, but might lead to substantial therapeutic improvements. 
<h3>21296405</h3>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.<br><br>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an idiopathic, fatal neurodegenerative disease of the <span class="annotated ">human</span> motor system. In this Seminar, we summarise current concepts about the origin of the disease, what predisposes <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> to develop the disorder, and discuss why all cases of ALS are not the same. In the 150 years since Charcot originally described ALS, painfully slow progress has been made towards answering these questions. We focus on what is known about ALS and where research is heading-from the small steps of extending longevity, improving therapies, undertaking clinical trials, and compiling population registries to the overarching goals of establishing the measures that guard against onset and finding the triggers for this neurodegenerative disorder. 
<h3>21349577</h3>Ventricular septal defect.<br><br>Ventricular septal defects account for up to 40% of all congenital cardiac malformations. The diagnosis encompasses a broad range of anomalies, including isolated defects and those associated with other congenital cardiac malformations. Presentation, symptoms, natural history, and management of ventricular septal defects depend on size and anatomical associations of the anomaly, patient's age, and local diagnostic and interventional expertise. In this Seminar, we describe the anatomical range of ventricular septal defects and discuss present management of these malformations. Genetic determinants, diagnostic techniques, physiological considerations, and management challenges are examined in detail. Unfortunately, in many circumstances, evidence on which to guide optimum management is scarce. We present some longer term considerations of ventricular septal defects in adolescents and adults, with particular emphasis on <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with raised pulmonary vascular resistance and Eisenmenger's syndrome. 
<h3>21349766</h3>Treatment implications of the emerging molecular classification system for melanoma. <br><br>Melanoma is an aggressive disease with few standard treatment options. The conventional classification system for this disease is based on histological growth patterns, with division into four subtypes: superficial spreading, lentigo maligna, nodular, and acral lentiginous. Major limitations of this classification system are absence of prognostic importance and little correlation with treatment outcomes. Recent preclinical and clinical findings support the notion that melanoma is not one malignant disorder but rather a family of distinct molecular diseases. Incorporation of genetic signatures into the conventional histopathological classification of melanoma has great implications for development of new and effective treatments. Genes of the mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway harbour alterations sometimes identified in <span class="linneaus_only ">people</span> with melanoma. The mutation Val600Glu in the BRAF oncogene (designated BRAF(V600E)) has been associated with sensitivity in vitro and in vivo to agents that inhibit BRAF(V600E) or MEK (a kinase in the MAPK pathway). Melanomas arising from mucosal, acral, chronically sun-damaged surfaces sometimes have oncogenic mutations in KIT, against which several inhibitors have shown clinical efficacy. Some uveal melanomas have activating mutations in GNAQ and GNA11, rendering them potentially susceptible to MEK inhibition. These findings suggest that prospective genotyping of <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with melanoma should be used increasingly as we work to develop new and effective treatments for this disease. 
<h3>21354373</h3>International Cognition and Cancer Task Force recommendations to harmonise studies of cognitive function in <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with cancer. <br><br>It has become increasingly apparent that cytotoxic drugs given systemically for non-CNS tumours might have cognitive side-effects, but many fundamental questions require further elucidation, and large samples from several institutions are needed. Two working groups brought together by the International Cognition and Cancer Task Force (ICCTF) developed recommendations for a core set of neuropsychological tests, common criterion for defining cognitive impairment and cognitive changes, and common approaches to improve the homogeneity of study methods. These recommendations will improve research design and facilitate study combinations, between-study comparisons, and meta-analyses, which will allow more accurate estimates of incidence, severity, individual risk factors, and causes of cognitive problems associated with chemotherapy for non-CNS tumours. 
<h3>21371655</h3>Clinical management of <span class="annotated ">Staphylococcus aureus</span> bacteraemia.<br><br><span class="annotated ">Staphylococcus aureus</span> bacteraemia is one of the most common serious bacterial infections worldwide. In the UK alone, around 12,500 cases each year are reported, with an associated mortality of about 30%, yet the evidence guiding optimum management is poor. To date, fewer than 1500 <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with <span class="annotated ">S aureus</span> bacteraemia have been recruited to 16 controlled trials of antimicrobial therapy. Consequently, clinical practice is driven by the results of observational studies and anecdote. Here, we propose and review ten unanswered clinical questions commonly posed by those managing <span class="annotated ">S aureus</span> bacteraemia. Our findings define the major areas of uncertainty in the management of <span class="annotated ">S aureus</span> bacteraemia and highlight just two key principles. First, all infective foci must be identified and removed as soon as possible. Second, long-term antimicrobial therapy is required for those with persistent bacteraemia or a deep, irremovable focus. Beyond this, the best drugs, dose, mode of delivery, and duration of therapy are uncertain, a situation compounded by emerging <span class="annotated ">S aureus</span> strains that are resistant to old and new antibiotics. We discuss the consequences on clinical practice, and how these findings define the agenda for future clinical research. 
<h3>21371658</h3>Guidelines for hospital-acquired pneumonia and health-care-associated pneumonia: a vulnerability, a pitfall, and a fatal flaw. <br><br>The 2005 American Thoracic Society and Infectious Disease Society of America's guidelines for pneumonia introduced the new category of health-care-associated pneumonia, which increased the number of <span class="linneaus_only ">people</span> to whom the guidelines for multidrug-resistant pathogens applied. Three fundamental issues inherent in the definition of hospital-acquired pneumonia and health-care-associated pneumonia undermined the credibility of these guidelines and the applicability of their recommendations: a vulnerability, a pitfall, and a fatal flaw. The vulnerability is the extreme heterogeneity of the population of <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span>. The fatal flaw is the failure to accurately diagnose hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia; inability to distinguish colonisation from infection in respiratory-tract cultures renders the guidelines inherently unstable. The pitfall is spiralling empiricism of antibiotic use for severely ill <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> in whom infection might not be present. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> vicious circle of antibiotic overuse leading to emergence of resistant microflora can become established, leading to unnecessary use of empirical broad-spectrum combination antibiotics and increased mortality. Controlled studies now show that administration of broad-spectrum combination antibiotic therapy can lead to increased mortality in uninfected <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span>. Proposed solutions include the use of individualised assessment of <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span>. Health-care-associated pneumonia should be broken down into several distinct subgroups so narrow-spectrum antibiotic therapy can be used. Emphasis should be placed on defining the microbial cause of the pneumonia rather than reflex administration of empirical combination therapy. 
<h3>21376291</h3>Serum c testing in <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with HER2-positive breast cancer: the death knell tolls. <br><br>Determination of the <span class="unannotated ">human</span> epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; also known as ERBB2) status of breast tumours is emphasised in various national guidelines as a necessary step for the diagnosis of breast cancer. As an alternative to tissue-based diagnostic methods, there has been substantial interest in the establishment of an easily accessible serum-based alternative that could be used for prognosis and diagnosis. Detection of serum-soluble-HER2 extracellular domain (ECD) and establishment of its potential clinical usefulness has created much debate. We assessed whether identification of circulating concentrations of HER2 ECD have clinical usefulness for management of <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with HER2-positive breast cancer. We examined data from 63 studies of <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with breast cancer. Prevalence of increased concentrations varied greatly between studies. Some studies showed significant associations between raised concentrations and poor prognosis, poor response to treatments including trastuzumab, or tumour characteristics associated with aggressive disease, whereas others did not. Examination of existing data showed that concentrations of HER2 ECD are not consistently related to <span class="linneaus_only ">patient</span> outcomes; therefore, there is insufficient evidence to support the clinical use of serum HER2 ECD testing. Design and execution of future large-scale trials to investigate the clinical use of HER2 ECD testing, in view of the progressive non-supportive evidence, is not recommended. Oncologists should continue to adhere to national guidelines for determining HER2 status. Furthermore, oncologists should continue to use clinical parameters when making decisions about initiation, continuation, and discontinuation of HER2-targeted treatments. 
<h3>21397320</h3>Chronic pancreatitis.<br><br>Chronic pancreatitis is a progressive fibroinflammatory disease that exists in large-duct (often with intraductal calculi) or small-duct form. In many <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> this disease results from a complex mix of environmental (eg, alcohol, cigarettes, and occupational chemicals) and genetic factors (eg, mutation in a trypsin-controlling gene or the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator); a few <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> have hereditary or autoimmune disease. Pain in the form of recurrent attacks of pancreatitis (representing paralysis of apical exocytosis in acinar cells) or constant and disabling pain is usually the main symptom. Management of the pain is mainly empirical, involving potent analgesics, duct drainage by endoscopic or surgical means, and partial or total pancreatectomy. However, steroids rapidly reduce symptoms in <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with autoimmune pancreatitis, and micronutrient therapy to correct electrophilic stress is emerging as a promising treatment in the other <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span>. Steatorrhoea, diabetes, local complications, and psychosocial issues associated with the disease are additional therapeutic challenges. 
<h3>21429803</h3>European guidelines on the clinical management of <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> tropism testing.<br><br>Viral tropism is the ability of viruses to enter and infect specific host cells and is based on the ability of viruses to bind to receptors on those cells. Testing for <span class="annotated ">HIV</span> tropism is recommended before prescribing a chemokine receptor blocker. In most European countries, <span class="annotated ">HIV</span> tropism is identified with tropism phenotype testing. New data support genotype analysis of the <span class="annotated ">HIV</span> third hypervariable loop (V3) for the identification of tropism. The European Consensus Group on clinical management of tropism testing was established to make recommendations to clinicians and clinical virologists. The panel recommends <span class="annotated ">HIV</span>-tropism testing for the following groups: drug-naive <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> in whom toxic effects are anticipated or for whom few treatment options are available; <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> who have poor tolerability to or toxic effects from current treatment or who have CNS pathology; and <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> for whom therapy has failed and a change in treatment is considered. In general, an enhanced sensitivity Trofile assay and V3 population genotyping are the recommended methods. Genotypic methods are anticipated to be used more frequently in the clinical setting because of their greater accessibility, lower cost, and faster turnaround time than other methods. For the interpretation of V3 loop genotyping, clinically validated systems should be used when possible. Laboratories doing <span class="annotated ">HIV</span> tropism tests should have adequate quality assurance measures. Similarly, close collaboration between <span class="annotated ">HIV</span> clinicians and virologists is needed to ensure adequate diagnostic and treatment decisions. 
<h3>21435601</h3>Induced pluripotent stem cells: a new revolution for clinical neurology?<br><br>Why specific neuronal populations are uniquely susceptible in neurodegenerative diseases remains a mystery. Brain tissue samples from <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> are rarely available for testing, and animal models frequently do not recapitulate all features of a specific disorder; therefore, pathophysiological investigations are difficult. An exciting new avenue for neurological research and drug development is the discovery that patients' somatic cells can be reprogrammed to a pluripotent state; these cells are known as induced pluripotent stem cells. Once pluripotency is reinstated, cell colonies can be expanded and differentiated into specific neural populations. The availability of these cells enables the monitoring in vitro of temporal features of disease initiation and progression, and testing of new drug treatments on the patient's own cells. Hence, this swiftly growing area of research has the potential to contribute greatly to our understanding of the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. 
<h3>21435708</h3>Viral pneumonia.<br><br>About 200 million cases of <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> community-acquired pneumonia occur every year-100 million in <span class="linneaus_only ">children</span> and 100 million in adults. Molecular diagnostic tests have greatly increased our understanding of the role of viruses in pneumonia, and findings indicate that the incidence of <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> pneumonia has been underestimated. In <span class="linneaus_only ">children</span>, <span class="annotated ">respiratory syncytial virus</span>, rhinovirus, <span class="annotated ">human metapneumovirus</span>, <span class="annotated ">human bocavirus</span>, and parainfluenza viruses are the agents identified most frequently in both developed and developing countries. Dual <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> infections are common, and a third of <span class="linneaus_only ">children</span> have evidence of viral-bacterial co-infection. In adults, viruses are the putative causative agents in a third of cases of community-acquired pneumonia, in particular <span class="unannotated ">influenza viruses</span>, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses. Bacteria continue to have a predominant role in adults with pneumonia. Presence of <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> epidemics in the community, patient's age, speed of onset of illness, symptoms, biomarkers, radiographic changes, and response to treatment can help differentiate <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> from bacterial pneumonia. However, no clinical algorithm exists that will distinguish clearly the cause of pneumonia. No clear consensus has been reached about whether <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with obvious <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> community-acquired pneumonia need to be treated with antibiotics. Apart from neuraminidase inhibitors for pneumonia caused by <span class="unannotated ">influenza viruses</span>, there is no clear role for use of specific antivirals to treat <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> community-acquired pneumonia. Influenza vaccines are the only available specific preventive measures. Further studies are needed to better understand the cause and pathogenesis of community-acquired pneumonia. Furthermore, regional differences in cause of pneumonia should be investigated, in particular to obtain more data from developing countries. 
<h3>21453871</h3>Mucormycosis: its contemporary face and management strategies.<br><br>Several countries have seen rising frequencies of mucormycosis among <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with haematological disorders, malignancies, or diabetes mellitus, and among transplant recipients. Growing numbers of immunocompromised hosts, widespread use of antifungal agents inactive against mucormycosis, or other unidentified factors, could be contributing to this situation. The predominant clinical manifestations of mucormycosis vary from host to host. Additionally, risk factors specific to different subgroups have been identified, such as leukaemia, allogeneic haemopoietic stem-cell transplant, voriconazole prophylaxis, diabetes, and malnutrition. We summarise the current state of knowledge of characteristics and risk factors and discuss topical developments in therapeutic methods and strategies in the management of mucormycosis. 
<h3>21474379</h3>Response assessment in neuro-oncology (a report of the RANO group): assessment of outcome in trials of diffuse low-grade gliomas. <br><br>Although low-grade gliomas (LGG) have a less aggressive course than do high-grade gliomas, the outcome of these tumours is ultimately fatal in most <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span>. Both the tumour and its treatment can cause disabling morbidity, particularly of cognitive functions. Because many <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> present with seizures only, with no other signs and symptoms, maintenance of quality of life and function constitutes a particular challenge in LGG. The slow growth pattern of most LGG, and the rare radiological true responses despite a favourable clinical response to treatment, interferes with the use of progression-free survival as the primary endpoint in trials. Overall survival as an endpoint brings logistical challenges, and is sensitive to other non-investigational salvage therapies. Clinical trials for LGG need to consider other measures of <span class="linneaus_only ">patient</span> benefit such as cognition, symptom burden, and seizure activity, to establish whether improved survival is reflected in prolonged wellbeing. This Review investigates clinical and imaging endpoints in trials of LGG, and provides response assessment in neuro-oncology (RANO) criteria for non-enhancing tumours. Additionally, other measures for <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with brain tumours that assess outcome are described. Similar considerations are relevant for trials of high-grade gliomas, although for these tumours survival is shorter and survival endpoints generally have more value than they do for LGG. 
<h3>21498115</h3>No paradox, no progress: inverse cancer comorbidity in <span class="linneaus_only ">people</span> with other complex diseases. <br><br>In the past 5 years, several leading groups have attempted to explain why individuals with Down's syndrome have a reduced risk of many solid tumours and an increased risk of leukaemia and testicular cancer. Niels Bohr, the Danish physicist, noted that a paradox could initiate progress. We think that the paradox of a medical disorder protecting against cancer could be formalised in a new model of inverse cancer morbidity in <span class="linneaus_only ">people</span> with other serious diseases. In this Personal View, we review evidence from epidemiological and clinical studies that supports a consistently lower than expected occurrence of cancer in <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with Down's syndrome, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and anorexia nervosa. Intriguingly, most comorbidities are neuropsychiatric or CNS disorders. We provide a brief overview of evidence indicating genetic and molecular connections between cancer and these complex diseases. Inverse comorbidity could be a valuable model to investigate common or related pathways or processes and test new therapies, but, most importantly, to understand why certain <span class="linneaus_only ">people</span> are protected from the malignancy. 
<h3>21511199</h3>Stroke and the immune system: from pathophysiology to new therapeutic strategies. <br><br>Stroke is the second most common cause of death worldwide and a major cause of acquired disability in adults. Despite tremendous progress in understanding the pathophysiology of stroke, translation of this knowledge into effective therapies has largely failed, with the exception of thrombolysis, which only benefits a small proportion of <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span>. Systemic and local immune responses have important roles in causing stroke and are implicated in the primary and secondary progression of ischaemic lesions, as well as in repair, recovery, and overall outcome after a stroke. However, potential therapeutic targets in the immune system and inflammatory responses have not been well characterised. Development of novel and effective therapeutic strategies for stroke will require further investigation of these pathways in terms of their temporal profile (before, during, and after stroke) and risk-to-benefit therapeutic ratio of modulating them. 
<h3>21511200</h3>Emerging targets and treatments in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.<br><br>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive motor neuron disease that is currently untreatable. Many compounds have been tested in laboratory-based models and in <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with ALS, but so far only one drug, riluzole, has shown efficacy, yet it only slightly slows disease progression. Several new insights into the causes of motor neuron death have led to the identification of some important novel targets for intervention. At no time have studies involved such a wide range of innovations and such advanced technologies. Many promising studies are underway to test potential targets that will hopefully translate into meaningful therapeutics for <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with ALS. 
<h3>21526934</h3>Factors of susceptibility of <span class="annotated ">human</span> myiasis caused by the <span class="annotated ">New World screw-worm</span>, <span class="annotated ">Cochliomyia hominivorax</span> in Sao Gonsigmaalo, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. <br><br>This study was carried out between July 2007 and June 2008 and reports on the occurrence of <span class="annotated ">human</span> myiasis caused by the New World screwworm, <span class="annotated ">Cochliomyia hominivorax</span> (Coquerel) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) in Sao Gonsigmaalo in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Liquid or solid vaseline was used to suffocate the larvae, which were then preserved in 70% ethanol and sent to the Instituto Oswaldo Cruz for identification. <span class="annotated ">C. hominivorax</span> were identified in all 22 cases of myiasis. There were 12 male and 10 female <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with ages ranging from 03 to 71. Ethnically the highest incidence was among <span class="unannotated ">black</span> <span class="linneaus_only ">people</span>, with 17 cases. Open wounds were the main cause of the parasitosis, whereas poor personal hygiene, the low educational level, alcoholism, bedridden <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span>, and physical or mental disability were possibly secondary factors; in addition to all these factors the income of the <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> was very low. 
<h3>21807108</h3>Fluorescent protein fusions in <span class="annotated ">Candida guilliermondii</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Candida guilliermondii</span> is an emerging <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> agent of candidiasis often associated with oncology <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span>. This <span class="annotated ">yeast</span> also remains a promising biotechnological model for the industrial production of value-added metabolites. In the present study, we developed a recipient strain as well as a set of plasmids for construction of fluorescent protein (FP) fusions in this species. We demonstrated that <span class="annotated ">C. guilliermondii</span> phosphoglycerate kinase transcription-regulating sequences allow a constitutive expression of codon-optimized green, cyan, yellow and mCherry FP genes in <span class="annotated ">C. guilliermondii</span> cells and the fluorescence signal could be directly observed at the colony and blastospore level by epifluorescence microcopy. To illustrate differential targeting of the FPs into specified cellular compartments, we studied and validated the expected subcellular localization of various <span class="annotated ">C. guilliermondii</span> predicted proteins fused to FPs. Furthermore, co-expression experiments of various couples of FP-tagged <span class="annotated ">C. guilliermondii</span> predicted proteins in the same cell showed that the fluorescence of each FP could be detected independently, providing firm evidences that YFP/CFP and GFP/mCherry pairs can be used for dual labeling in <span class="annotated ">C. guilliermondii</span> cells. This technical advance will facilitate future studies of protein co-expression and co-localization in <span class="annotated ">C. guilliermondii</span> and will give precious help for elucidating new molecular events supporting pathogenicity, antifungal resistance and for exploring the potential of <span class="annotated ">yeast</span> metabolic engineering. 
<h3>20599424</h3>Radionuclide and hybrid imaging of recurrent prostate cancer.<br><br>Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in <span class="linneaus_only ">men</span>, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. After definitive therapy with surgery or radiation, many <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> have biochemical relapse of disease--ie, an increase in their prostate-specific antigen level--which often precedes clinically apparent disease by months or even years. Therefore, imaging of the site and extent of tumour recurrence (local, regional, distant, or a combination) is of great interest. Conventional morphological imaging methods showed limited accuracy for assessment of recurrent prostate cancer; however, in recent years, functional and molecular imaging have offered the possibility of imaging molecular or cellular processes of individual tumours, often with more accuracy than morphological imaging. Hybrid imaging modalities (PET-CT, and single-photon emission CT [SPECT]-CT) have been introduced that combine functional and morphological data and allow whole-body imaging. Here, we review the contribution of radionuclide imaging and hybrid imaging for assessment of recurrent prostate cancer (local vs regional vs distant disease). We discuss available data on PET-CT and SPECT-CT, and provide an overview of experimental tracers and their preclinical and clinical development. Finally, we present a perspective on the potential of future hybrid magnetic resonance-PET imaging. 
<h3>20619737</h3>Fertility-sparing surgery in <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with cervical cancer.<br><br>There are several types of fertility saving procedures that can be done in <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with cervical cancer, which differ in terms of surgical approach and extent of paracervical resection. This review assesses oncological and pregnancy results after different procedures. The oncological results of vaginal radical trachelectomies (VRT) and abdominal radical trachelectomies (ART) are similar for tumours less than 2 cm in size, and are now considered safe surgical procedures. Oncological outcomes of VRT and ART in tumours larger than 2 cm are also identical, but the results cannot be considered satisfactory. Preliminary findings of less radical procedures (ie, deep cone and simple trachelectomy) in <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with tumours less than 2 cm, and negative sentinel and other pelvic lymph nodes, are comparable with the results of VRT and ART. Downstaging tumours larger than 2 cm by neoadjuvant chemotherapy is still an experimental procedure and will need multicentre cooperation to verify its oncological safety. Pregnancy results vary statistically with the different methods. 
<h3>20980526</h3>An in-depth analysis of original antigenic sin in <span class="annotated ">dengue virus</span> infection.<br><br>The evolution of <span class="annotated ">dengue viruses</span> has resulted in four antigenically similar yet distinct serotypes. Infection with one serotype likely elicits lifelong immunity to that serotype, but generally not against the other three. Secondary or sequential infections are common, as multiple <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> serotypes frequently cocirculate. <span class="annotated ">Dengue</span> infection, although frequently mild, can lead to <span class="annotated ">dengue</span> hemorrhagic fever (DHF) which can be life threatening. DHF is more common in secondary <span class="annotated ">dengue</span> infections, implying a role for the adaptive immune response in the disease. There is currently much effort toward the design and implementation of a <span class="unannotated ">dengue</span> vaccine but these efforts are made more difficult by the challenge of inducing durable neutralizing immunity to all four viruses. Domain 3 of the <span class="annotated ">dengue virus</span> envelope protein (ED3) has been suggested as one such candidate because it contains neutralizing epitopes and it was originally thought that relatively few cross-reactive antibodies are directed to this domain. In this study, we performed a detailed analysis of the anti-ED3 response in a cohort of <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> suffering either primary or secondary <span class="annotated ">dengue</span> infections. The results show dramatic evidence of original antigenic sin in secondary infections both in terms of binding and enhancement activity. This has important implications for <span class="annotated ">dengue</span> vaccine design because heterologous boosting is likely to maintain the immunological footprint of the first vaccination. On the basis of these findings, we propose a simple in vitro enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to diagnose the original <span class="annotated ">dengue</span> infection in secondary <span class="annotated ">dengue</span> cases. 
<h3>21459211</h3>Increasing burden of liver disease in <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with <span class="unannotated ">HIV</span> infection.<br><br>Introduction of effective combined antiretroviral therapy has made <span class="unannotated ">HIV</span> infection a chronic illness. Substantial reductions in the number of AIDS-related deaths have been accompanied by an increase in liver-related morbidity and mortality due to co-infection with chronic <span class="unannotated ">hepatitis B</span> and C viruses. Increases in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and drug-induced hepatotoxicity, together with development of hepatocellular carcinoma, also potentiate the burden of liver disease in individuals with <span class="unannotated ">HIV</span> infection. We provide an overview of the key causes, disease mechanisms of pathogenesis, and recommendations for treatment options including the evolving role of liver transplantation. 
<h3>21474172</h3>Post-splenectomy and hyposplenic states.<br><br>The spleen is crucial in regulating immune homoeostasis through its ability to link innate and adaptive immunity and in protecting against infections. The impairment of splenic function is defined as hyposplenism, an acquired disorder caused by several haematological and immunological diseases. The term asplenia refers to the absence of the spleen, a condition that is rarely congenital and mostly post-surgical. Although hyposplenism and asplenia might predispose individuals to thromboembolic events, in this Review we focus on infectious complications, which are the most widely recognised consequences of these states. Because of the high mortality, the fulminant course, and the refractoriness to common treatment of overwhelming infections caused by encapsulated bacteria, prevention through vaccination and antibiotic prophylaxis is the basis of the management of <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> who have had splenectomy or have hyposplenism. In this Review, we critically assess clinical and diagnostic aspects of splenic dysfunction and highlight new perspectives in the prevention of overwhelming post-splenectomy infections. 
<h3>21511048</h3>The contribution of the S-phase checkpoint genes MEC1 and SGS1 to genome stability maintenance in <span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span>. <br><br>Genome rearrangements, a common feature of <span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span> isolates, are often associated with the acquisition of antifungal drug resistance. In <span class="annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, perturbations in the S-phase checkpoints result in the same sort of Gross Chromosomal Rearrangements (GCRs) observed in <span class="annotated ">C. albicans</span>. Several proteins are involved in the <span class="annotated ">S. cerevisiae</span> cell cycle checkpoints, including Mec1p, a protein kinase of the PIKK (phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase-like kinase) family and the central player in the DNA damage checkpoint. Sgs1p, the ortholog of BLM, the Bloom's syndrome gene, is a RecQ-related DNA helicase; cells from BLM <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> are characterized by an increase in genome instability. <span class="annotated ">Yeast</span> strains bearing deletions in MEC1 or SGS1 are viable (in contrast to the inviability seen with loss of MEC1 in <span class="annotated ">S. cerevisiae</span>) but the different deletion mutants have significantly different phenotypes. The mec1Delta/Delta colonies have a wild-type colony morphology, while the sgs1Delta/Delta mutants are slow-growing, producing wrinkled colonies with pseudohyphal-like cells. The mec1Delta/Delta mutants are only sensitive to ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS), methylmethane sulfonate (MMS), and hydroxyurea (HU) but the sgs1Delta/Delta mutants exhibit a high sensitivity to all DNA-damaging agents tested. In an assay for chromosome 1 integrity, the mec1Delta/Delta mutants exhibit an increase in genome instability; no change was observed in the sgs1Delta/Delta mutants. Finally, loss of MEC1 does not affect sensitivity to the antifungal drug fluconazole, while loss of SGS1 leads to an increased susceptibility to fluconazole. Neither deletion elevated the level of antifungal drug resistance acquisition. 
<h3>21514890</h3>Postural deformities in Parkinson's disease.<br><br>Postural deformities are frequent and disabling complications of Parkinson's disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonism. These deformities include camptocormia, antecollis, Pisa syndrome, and scoliosis. Recognition of specific postural syndromes might have differential diagnostic value in <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> presenting with parkinsonism. The evidence to date suggests that postural deformities have a multifactorial pathophysiology. Contributing factors include muscular rigidity; axial dystonia; weakness caused by myopathy; body scheme defects due to centrally impaired proprioception; and structural changes in the spine. The relative contribution of these different factors varies between <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> and across specific syndromes. Improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying postural deformities in PD might ultimately lead us to more effective management strategies for these disabling and drug-refractory complications. 
<h3>20950650</h3>Rapid detection of drug-resistant mutations in <span class="annotated ">hepatitis B virus</span> by the PCR-Invader assay. <br><br>Early detection of resistant mutations of <span class="annotated ">hepatitis B virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">HBV</span>) is important for <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> on nucleos(t)ide analog therapy. An assay based on the PCR-Invader technology was developed to detect resistant mutations with high sensitivity. The assay specifically detects mutations at codons 180, 181, 184, 202, 204, and 250 of the <span class="annotated ">HBV</span> polymerase reverse transcriptase domain. These mutations result in resistance to lamivudine and entecavir. In mixtures of plasmids containing wild-type and resistant mutants, fold-over-zero values for resistant mutations were detected in 2% of the total. Seventy-five serum samples from <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span>, whose treatment had been switched from lamivudine to entecavir, were examined by the PCR-Invader assay and direct sequencing. The PCR-Invader assay detected all resistant mutations that were detected by direct sequencing and even detected the presence of mutants that direct sequencing could not. Cloning sequencing confirmed those mutations found by the PCR-Invader assay and not by direct sequencing. The PCR-Invader assay is a useful tool for the early detection of drug-resistant mutations. 
<h3>21035400</h3>Energy metabolism in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.<br><br>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterised by the progressive degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. Besides motor neuron degeneration, ALS is associated with several defects in energy metabolism, including weight loss, hypermetabolism, and hyperlipidaemia. Most of these abnormalities correlate with duration of survival, and available clinical evidence supports a negative contribution of defective energy metabolism to the overall pathogenic process. Findings from animal models of ALS support this view and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms. Altogether, these results have clinical consequences for the management of defective energy metabolism in <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with ALS and pave the way for future therapeutic interventions. 
<h3>21183148</h3>Endotoxin removal devices for the treatment of sepsis and septic shock.<br><br>A substantial body of experimental and clinical evidence suggests that neutralising or removing lipopolysaccharide endotoxin would be an effective adjunctive approach to the management of Gram-negative sepsis. Polymyxins are a group of cyclic cationic polypeptide antibiotics. Although they have useful antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria, their clinical use has been limited because of toxicity. However, in addition to their antimicrobial property, polymyxins can bind to and neutralise endotoxin. Thus, investigators have explored the possibility of using polymyxin bound to a solid-phase carrier for specific haem-adsorption in <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with sepsis, thereby retaining the lipopolysaccharide-binding properties but minimising systemic toxic effects. This system has been widely used in Japan for many years, but convincing clinical evidence of efficacy is lacking. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> recent Italian study has some promising data. Although polymyxin has been the principal agent used to explore this approach, other molecules have the ability to bind endotoxin, and some of these have very recently been proposed as the basis for other endotoxin-removal devices. The available evidence is reviewed to assess the potential use of such devices in clinical practice. 
<h3>21435599</h3>Long-term outcomes of <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.<br><br>More and more <span class="match linneaus_only ">patients</span> survive aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH), with case fatality decreasing by 17% in absolute terms over the past three decades and incidence remaining relatively stable at nine per 100,000 patient-years. The mean age at which aSAH occurs is reasonably young at 55 years, and <span class="linneaus_only ">people</span> of this age in the general population have a good life expectancy. However, there are few data for life expectancy after aSAH, and the risks of late recurrent aSAH and other vascular diseases are unclear. The course of associated long-term physical and cognitive deficits after aSAH is not well established, leading to questions about potential outcomes to quality of life and working capacity, as well as best clinical practices.
