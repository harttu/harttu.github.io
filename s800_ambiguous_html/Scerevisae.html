<h2>S. cerevisae</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21281727</h3>Identification and characterization of putative osmosensors, HwSho1A and HwSho1B, from the extremely halotolerant <span class="unannotated ">black</span> <span class="unannotated ">yeast</span> <span class="annotated ">Hortaea werneckii</span>. <br><br>In <span class="annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, the Sho1 protein is one of two potential osmosensors that can activate the kinase cascade of the HOG pathway in response to increased extracellular osmolarity. Two novel SHO1-like genes, HwSHO1A and HwSHO1B, have been cloned from the saltern-inhabiting, extremely halotolerant <span class="unannotated ">black</span> <span class="unannotated ">yeast</span> <span class="annotated ">Hortaea werneckii</span>. The HwSho1 protein isoforms are 93.8% identical in their amino-acid sequences, and have a conserved SH3 domain. When the HwSHO1 genes were transferred into <span class="match annotated ">S. cerevisae</span> cells lacking the SHO1 gene, both of the HwSho1 isoforms fully complemented the function of the native <span class="annotated ">S. cerevisiae</span> Sho1 protein. Through microscopic and biochemical validation, we demonstrate that in <span class="annotated ">S. cerevisiae</span>, both of the HwSho1 proteins have characteristic subcellular localizations similar to the <span class="annotated ">S. cerevisiae</span> Sho1 protein, and they can both activate the HOG pathway under conditions of osmotic stress. To a lower extent, crosstalk to the mating pathway expressing HwSho1 proteins is conserved in the PBS2 deleted <span class="annotated ">S. cerevisiae</span> strain. These data show that the HwSho1 proteins from <span class="annotated ">H. werneckii</span> are true functional homologs of the Sho1 protein of <span class="annotated ">S. cerevisiae</span>.
