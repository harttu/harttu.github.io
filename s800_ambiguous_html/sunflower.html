</br>
( the presumed area of endemism of annual <b>sunflower</b> species in the genus Helianthus ) . 
</br>
C . adspersus and their larval parasitoids were collected from stems of four native <b>sunflower</b> species ( SB__Helianthus SI__annuus , SB__H SI__. SI__nuttallii , SB__H SI__. SI__pauciflorus , and SB__H SI__. SI__petiolaris ) from 147 sites across eight states . 
</br>
Native SB__H SI__. SI__annuus constituted the majority of the <b>sunflower</b> populations . 
</br>
Mean weevil densities were significantly higher in <b>sunflower</b> stalks that were larger in diameter . 
</br>
After accounting for the effects of stalk diameter and location , weevil densities did not differ among the four <b>sunflower</b> species nor did they differ as a function of elevation . 
</br>
All parasitoid species have been previously reported attacking C . adspersus larvae in cultivated <b>sunflower</b> . 
</br>
Species richness was less diverse in these collections than from previous studies of cultivated <b>sunflower</b> . 
</br>
Our findings suggest that the species of larval parasitoids attacking C . adspersus in native sunflowers have successfully made the transition to cultivated <b>sunflower</b> .
