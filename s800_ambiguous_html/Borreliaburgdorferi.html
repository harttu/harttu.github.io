<h2>Borrelia burgdorferi</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20796206</h3>Linking disease and community ecology through behavioural indicators: immunochallenge of <span class="yellow">white-footed mice</span> and its ecological impacts. <br><br>1. Pathogens and immune challenges can induce changes in host phenotype in ways that indirectly impact important community interactions, including those that affect host-pathogen interactions. 2. To explore host behavioural response to immune challenge, we exposed wild <span class="yellow">white-footed mice</span> (<span class="yellow">Peromyscus leucopus</span>) to an immunogen from an endemic, zoonotic pathogen, the spirochete <span class="blue">Borrelia burgdorferi</span>. <span class="yellow">White-footed mice</span> are a major reservoir host of Lyme disease (LD) spirochetes in northeastern USA and an abundant member of forest communities. The activity patterns, foraging behaviour, and space use of <span class="yellow">white-footed mice</span> have implications for population growth rates of community members upon which <span class="yellow">mice</span> incidentally prey (i.e. gypsy moths and native thrushes), as well as potentially determining host-vector encounter rates and <span class="yellow">human</span> risk of LD. 3. Immunochallenge led to specific humoral (antibody) and cellular (i.e. elevated neutrophils and eosinophils) immune responses, supporting use of the immunogen as a surrogate for pathogenic infection. 4. Immunochallenged <span class="yellow">mice</span> had reduced wheel-running activity early in the night when measured in the lab. However, <span class="yellow">mouse</span> activity, as measured by track plates in natural field experiments, did not differ between <span class="yellow">mice</span> exposed to the immunogen and unexposed <span class="yellow">mice</span>. 5. Foraging behaviour of wild <span class="yellow">mice</span> in the field - assessed with giving-up densities of seed at artificial feeding stations - was affected by exposure to the immunogen. Whereas immunochallenge did not influence whether foraging <span class="yellow">mice</span> gained information on patch quality while foraging, it led to reductions in predator avoidance during foraging, suggesting that the proportion of space used by foraging <span class="yellow">mice</span> may be greater as a result of immunochallenge. This increased space use is predicted to increase encounter rates with patchily distributed LD vectors (ticks) and with incidental prey items. 6. Thus, immunochallenge in <span class="yellow">white-footed mice</span>, and potentially pathogenic infection, have the potential to indirectly impact community interactions, including those important for pathogen transmission. 
<h3>20935092</h3>Whole-genome sequences of thirteen isolates of <span class="blue">Borrelia burgdorferi</span>.<br><br><span class="blue">Borrelia burgdorferi</span> is a causative agent of Lyme disease in North America and Eurasia. The first complete genome sequence of <span class="yellow">B. burgdorferi strain 31</span>, available for more than a decade, has assisted research on the pathogenesis of Lyme disease. Because a single genome sequence is not sufficient to understand the relationship between genotypic and geographic variation and disease phenotype, we determined the whole-genome sequences of 13 additional <span class="yellow">B. burgdorferi</span> isolates that span the range of natural variation. These sequences should allow improved understanding of pathogenesis and provide a foundation for novel detection, diagnosis, and prevention strategies.
