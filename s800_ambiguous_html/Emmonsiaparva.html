<h2>Emmonsia parva</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20682355</h3>PRP8 intein in Ajellomycetaceae family pathogens: sequence analysis, splicing evaluation and homing endonuclease activity. <br><br>Inteins are intervening sequences that are transcribed and translated with flanking host protein sequences and then self-excised by protein splicing. Bi-functional inteins also contain a homing endonuclease responsible for their genetic mobility. The PRP8 intein, the most widespread among fungi, occurs in important pathogens such as <span class="annotated ">Histoplasma capsulatum</span> and <span class="annotated ">Paracoccidioides brasiliensis</span>, from the Ajellomycetaceae family. Herein, we describe the bi-functional PRP8 intein in two other Ajellomycetacean pathogens, <span class="annotated ">Blastomyces dermatitidis</span> and <span class="match annotated ">Emmonsia parva</span>. Sequence analysis and experimental evidence suggest that the homing endonuclease from PbrPRP8 is inactive. The splicing activity of the PRP8 intein from the <span class="annotated ">B. dermatitidis</span>, <span class="annotated ">E. parva</span> and <span class="annotated ">P. brasiliensis species complex</span> was demonstrated in a non-native protein context in <span class="annotated ">Escherichia coli</span>. Since the PRP8 intein is located in a functionally essential nuclear protein, it can be considered a promising therapeutic target for anti-fungal drugs, because inhibition of intein splicing should inhibit proliferation of intein-containing pathogens.
