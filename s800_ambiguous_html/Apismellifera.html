<h2>Apis mellifera</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21410804</h3>Genome-wide analysis of brain transcriptional changes in <span class="annotated ">honey bee</span> (<span class="match annotated ">Apis mellifera</span> L.) queens exposed to carbon dioxide and physical manipulation. <br><br>Mating is a complex process causing many behavioural and physiological changes, but the factors triggering them and the underlying molecular processes are not well characterized. In the present study we examine the effects of CO(2) (a commonly used anaesthetic in instrumental insemination that causes changes similar to those occurring after mating) and physical manipulation (which may mimic certain aspects of copulation) on the behavioural, physiological and brain transcriptional changes in <span class="annotated ">honey bee</span> queens. We show that while CO(2) causes cessation of mating flights and ovary activation, physical manipulation has additional effects on ovary activation and brain transcriptional changes. Comparisons with previous studies of <span class="annotated ">honey bees</span> and female <span class="annotated ">Drosophila</span> indicate that common molecular mechanisms may be responsible for regulating reproductive changes across different mating regimes and insect orders. 
<h3>21797944</h3>Insect insulin receptors: insights from sequence and caste expression analyses of two cloned hymenopteran insulin receptor cDNAs from the <span class="annotated ">fire ant</span>. <br><br>The insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signalling (IIS) pathway in the <span class="annotated ">honey bee</span> (<span class="match annotated ">Apis mellifera</span>) is linked to reproductive division of labour and foraging behaviour. Two insulin receptor genes are present in the released genomes of other social hymenopterans. Limited information is available on the IIS pathway role in ants. The predicted insulin receptor sequences from the recently released draft genome of the <span class="annotated ">fire ant</span> <span class="annotated ">Solenopsis invicta</span> (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) are incomplete and biologically significant data are also lacking. To elucidate the role of the IIS pathway in the <span class="unannotated ">fire ant</span>, two putative insulin receptors (SiInR-1 and SiInR-2) were cloned; the first InR cDNAs cloned from social insects. Analyses of putative post-translational modification sites in SiInRs revealed the potential for differential regulation. We investigated the transcriptional expression of both receptors at different developmental stages, castes and queen tissues. In last instar larvae and pharate pupae of workers and reproductive, transcriptional abundance of both receptors was negatively correlated with body size and nutritional status. The expression level of both receptors in different queen tissues appears to correlate with requirements for queen reproductive physiology and behaviours. This study contributes new information to the understanding of social insects because in <span class="annotated ">fire ants</span> juvenile hormone acts as a gonadotropin and workers are fully sterile, contrary to <span class="annotated ">honey bees</span>. 
<h3>21435061</h3>Social immunity in <span class="annotated ">honeybees</span> (<span class="match annotated ">Apis mellifera</span>): transcriptome analysis of varroa-hygienic behaviour. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Honeybees</span> have evolved a social immunity consisting of the cooperation of individuals to decrease disease in the hive. We identified a set of genes involved in this social immunity by analysing the brain transcriptome of highly varroa-hygienic bees, who efficiently detect and remove brood infected with the Varroa destructor mite. The function of these candidate genes does not seem to support a higher olfactory sensitivity in hygienic bees, as previously hypothesized. However, comparing their genomic profile with those from other behaviours suggests a link with brood care and the highly varroa-hygienic <span class="annotated ">Africanized honeybees</span>. These results represent a first step toward the identification of genes involved in social immunity and thus provide first insights into the evolution of social immunity.
