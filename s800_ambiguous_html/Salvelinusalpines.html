<h2>Salvelinus alpines</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21463300</h3>Heating up relations between cold fish: competition modifies responses to climate change. <br><br>Most predictions about species responses to climate change ignore species interactions. Helland and colleagues (2011) test whether this assumption is valid by evaluating whether ice cover affects competition between <span class="yellow">brown trout</span> [<span class="yellow">Salmo trutta</span> (L.)] and <span class="yellow">Arctic charr</span> [<span class="blue">Salvelinus alpines</span> (L.)]. They show that increasing ice cover correlates with lower <span class="yellow">trout</span> biomass when <span class="yellow">Arctic charr</span> co-occur, but not in <span class="yellow">charr's</span> absence. In experiments, <span class="yellow">charr</span> grew better in the cold, dark environments that typify ice-covered lakes. Decreasing ice cover with warmer winters could mean more <span class="yellow">trout</span> and fewer <span class="yellow">charr</span>. More generally, their results provide an excellent example, suggesting that species interactions can strongly modify responses to climate change.
