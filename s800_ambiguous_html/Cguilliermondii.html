<h2>C. guilliermondii</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21807108</h3>Fluorescent protein fusions in <span class="yellow">Candida guilliermondii</span>. <br><br><span class="yellow">Candida guilliermondii</span> is an emerging <span class="yellow">fungal</span> agent of candidiasis often associated with oncology patients. This <span class="yellow">yeast</span> also remains a promising biotechnological model for the industrial production of value-added metabolites. In the present study, we developed a recipient strain as well as a set of plasmids for construction of fluorescent protein (FP) fusions in this species. We demonstrated that <span class="blue">C. guilliermondii</span> phosphoglycerate kinase transcription-regulating sequences allow a constitutive expression of codon-optimized green, cyan, yellow and mCherry FP genes in <span class="blue">C. guilliermondii</span> cells and the fluorescence signal could be directly observed at the colony and blastospore level by epifluorescence microcopy. To illustrate differential targeting of the FPs into specified cellular compartments, we studied and validated the expected subcellular localization of various <span class="blue">C. guilliermondii</span> predicted proteins fused to FPs. Furthermore, co-expression experiments of various couples of FP-tagged <span class="blue">C. guilliermondii</span> predicted proteins in the same cell showed that the fluorescence of each FP could be detected independently, providing firm evidences that YFP/CFP and GFP/mCherry pairs can be used for dual labeling in <span class="blue">C. guilliermondii</span> cells. This technical advance will facilitate future studies of protein co-expression and co-localization in <span class="blue">C. guilliermondii</span> and will give precious help for elucidating new molecular events supporting pathogenicity, antifungal resistance and for exploring the potential of <span class="yellow">yeast</span> metabolic engineering.
