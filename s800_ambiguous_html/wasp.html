<h2>wasp</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21521143</h3>Post-egression host tissue feeding is another strategy of host regulation by the Koinobiont <span class="match unannotated ">wasp</span>, <span class="annotated ">Toxoneuron nigriceps</span>. <br><br>Koinobiont wasps start their lives as hemolymph feeders inside the host body, but before they egress from the host many become tissue predators. One species, the endoparasitoid <span class="annotated ">Toxoneuron nigriceps</span> Viereck (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), exhibits the unusual behavior of egressing before initiating tissue predation. After egression from the host, it reinserts its head into the host body to begin tissue feeding. These third instar <span class="annotated ">T. nigriceps</span> larvae show a significant increase in body size and mass after post-egression feeding. Through this project the importance of post-egression feeding in the development of <span class="annotated ">T. nigriceps</span> in its host the <span class="annotated ">tobacco budworm</span>, <span class="annotated ">Heliothis virescens</span> Fabricius (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), has been evaluated. The study was conducted by preventing the egressed third instar <span class="annotated ">T. nigriceps</span> larvae from feeding on host tissue and observing whether they could undergo further development. Though some of the larvae that were prevented from post-egression feeding did undergo cocoon formation, pupation, and adult emergence they were inferior in terms of size, body mass, and survival to those that developed from larvae allowed to feeding after egression. Hence, it is concluded that post-egression host tissue feeding is essential for the normal development of <span class="annotated ">T. nigriceps</span>, as the prevention of feeding resulted in significantly lighter and smaller larvae, cocoons, and adults as well as deformed adults and reduced adult survival. Post-egression feeding as a host regulatory strategy is discussed. 
<h3>22182621</h3>The Role of Frass and Cocoon Volatiles in Host Location by Monodontomerus aeneus, a Parasitoid of Megachilid Solitary Bees. <br><br>Monodontomerus aeneus (Fonscolombe) is a parasitic <span class="match unannotated ">wasp</span> that oviposits on the prepupae and pupae of <span class="annotated ">Osmia cornuta</span> (Latreille) and other solitary bee species. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> two-armed olfactometer was used to test the olfactory attractiveness of <span class="annotated ">O. cornuta</span> prepupae, cocoon, and larval frass to female M. aeneus. Both cocoon and frass attracted the female parasitoids, but frass alone was more attractive than the cocoon and the cocoon with frass was more attractive than frass alone. Female parasitoids were not attracted by the host prepupa. M33 (methanol) was the organic volatile most emitted by cocoons and m61 (acetic acid) was the compound most emitted by frass. However, cocoons showed higher emission for almost all compounds, including m61 (acetic acid). Although acetic acid alone attracted M. aeneus, a complex volatile signal is probably involved in the attraction process because the ratio of acetic acid and acetaldehyde characteristic of the frass was more attractive than other ratios. 
<h3>22182609</h3>Infection by Mycorrhizal Fungi Increases Natural Enemy Abundance on Tobacco (<span class="annotated ">Nicotiana rustica</span>). <br><br>The presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) influences plant nutrient uptake, growth, and plant defensive chemistry, thereby directly influencing multi-trophic interactions. Different <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> isolates (genotypes of the same <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> species) have been shown to differ in nutrient uptake ability. Plants infected with different AMF genotypes may vary in foliar nutrient or defensive chemical levels, potentially influencing multi-trophic interactions. Using a completely randomized design, we compared the effect of two isolates of the mycorrhizal fungus <span class="annotated ">Glomus etunicatum</span> W. N. Becker &amp; Gerdemann on <span class="annotated ">silver leaf whitefly</span> (<span class="annotated ">Bemisia argentifolii</span> Bellows &amp; Perring) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) and parasitic <span class="match unannotated ">wasp</span> (<span class="annotated ">Eretmocerus eremicus</span> Rose &amp; Zolnerowich) (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) abundance. Whitefly populations were not influenced by AMF infection. Parasite populations were higher on plants infected with the isolate collected from Georgia, even after controlling for whitefly abundance and plant architecture. We propose that AMF indirectly influences parasite abundance and parasitism through a change in leaf surface chemicals that affect parasitic wasps. Because of the ubiquity of and genetic variation in AMF, multi-trophic interactions are likely to be strongly influenced by belowground processes. 
<h3>21039561</h3>Ecological trade-offs between jasmonic acid-dependent direct and indirect plant defences in tritrophic interactions. <br><br>Recent studies on plants genetically modified in jasmonic acid (JA) signalling support the hypothesis that the jasmonate family of oxylipins plays an important role in mediating direct and indirect plant defences. However, the interaction of two modes of defence in tritrophic systems is largely unknown. In this study, we examined the preference and performance of a herbivorous <span class="annotated ">leafminer</span> (<span class="annotated ">Liriomyza huidobrensis</span>) and its parasitic <span class="match annotated ">wasp</span> (<span class="annotated ">Opius dissitus</span>) on three <span class="annotated ">tomato</span> genotypes: a <span class="annotated ">wild-type (WT) plant</span>, a <span class="annotated ">JA biosynthesis (spr2) mutant</span>, and a <span class="annotated ">JA-overexpression 35S::prosys plant</span>. Their proteinase inhibitor production and volatile emission were used as direct and indirect defence factors to evaluate the responses of <span class="annotated ">leafminers</span> and parasitoids. Here, we show that although <span class="annotated ">spr2 mutant plants</span> are compromised in direct defence against the larval <span class="annotated ">leafminers</span> and in attracting parasitoids, they are less attractive to adult <span class="linneaus_only ">flies</span> compared with <span class="annotated ">WT plants</span>. Moreover, in comparison to other genotypes, the <span class="annotated ">35S::prosys plant</span> displays greater direct and constitutive indirect defences, but reduced success of parasitism by parasitoids. Taken together, these results suggest that there are distinguished ecological trade-offs between JA-dependent direct and indirect defences in genetically modified plants whose fitness should be assessed in tritrophic systems and under natural conditions.
