<h2>Helicoverpa armigera</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21166910</h3>Natural history and intragenomic dynamics of the Transib transposon Hztransib in the <span class="yellow">cotton bollworm</span> <span class="yellow">Helicoverpa zea</span>. 

Hztransib, recently identified from <span class="yellow">Helicoverpa zea</span>, represents the first intact and transcriptionally active Transib element. Its open reading frame was detected in <span class="blue">Helicoverpa armigera</span>, from which <span class="yellow">H. zea</span> evolved, and in <span class="yellow">Helicoverpa assulta</span>, the common ancestor of <span class="yellow">H. zea</span> and <span class="yellow">H. armigera</span>, but its remaining parts were found only in <span class="yellow">H. armigera</span>. Thirty-nine Hztransib insertion sites, all of which are polymorphic, were detected from eight populations of <span class="yellow">H. zea</span>. Out of the 39 insertion sites, 35 were not frequently occupied, with 1-33 occurrences in a total of 128 individuals from the eight populations (16 larvae per population). Its copy number ranged from 5.8 to 14.2 per individual, with putative intact copies always more abundant than internally deleted ones. Taking this evidence together, Hztransib probably transferred to <span class="yellow">H. zea</span> from <span class="yellow">H. armigera</span> and most likely still retains its capacity to maintain structural integrity, increase copy number and remobilize in <span class="yellow">H. zea</span>. 
<h3>21585579</h3>Beta-Thymosin is upregulated by the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone and microorganisms. 

Thymosins have diverse biological activities including actin-sequestering and tissue repair in vertebrates, however, there is little information about the function of thymosins in invertebrates. We isolated a Beta-thymosin gene in <span class="blue">Helicoverpa armigera</span>. It has two transcript variants, HaTHY1 and HaTHY2, encoding 19.0 kDa and 14.5 kDa peptides, respectively. HaTHY1 was mainly transcribed in the integument and midgut, while HaTHY2 was principally presented in the fat body and haemocytes. The transcript levels of HaTHY2 showed some fluctuation; there was an obvious increase at the metamorphic stage in the integument or fat body. HaTHY was able to be upregulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone or by bacterial and <span class="yellow">viral</span> challenge. These data suggest that HaTHY is upregulated by the steroid hormone and by responses to microorganism infection.
