Little is known about endosomal pathway proteins involved in arthropod-borne <span class="yellow">virus</span> (arbovirus) assembly and cell-to-cell spread in vector mosquitoes. UNC93A and synaptic vesicle-2 (SV2) proteins are involved in intracellular transport in mammals. They show amino acid sequence conservation from mosquitoes to <span class="yellow">humans</span>, and their transcripts are highly enriched in <span class="yellow">Aedes aegypti</span> during arbovirus infection. Transient gene silencing of SV2 or UNC93A in mosquitoes infected with the recombinant alphavirus <span class="blue">Sindbis</span> MRE16-enhanced green fluorescent protein (<span class="yellow">SINV</span>; family Togaviridae) resulted in the accumulation of <span class="yellow">viral</span> positive- and negative-strand RNA, congregation of <span class="yellow">virus</span> envelope antigen in intracellular networks, and reduced <span class="yellow">virus</span> dissemination outside of the midgut. Further, UNC93A silencing, but not SV2 silencing, resulted in a 10-fold reduction in <span class="yellow">viral</span> titres at 4 days post-infection. Together, these data support a role for UNC93A and SV2 in <span class="yellow">virus</span> assembly or budding. Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) were identified at the 5'-ends of genes from the original data set in which SV2 and UNC93A were identified. Common CREs at the 5'-end genomic regions of a subset of enriched transcripts support the hypothesis that UNC93A transcription may be co-regulated with that of other ion transport and endosomal trafficking proteins.
