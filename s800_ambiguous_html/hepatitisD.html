<h2>hepatitis D</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21511329</h3><span class="yellow">Hepatitis delta virus</span>.<br><br><span class="yellow">Hepatitis delta virus</span> (<span class="yellow">HDV</span>) is a small, defective RNA <span class="yellow">virus</span> that can infect only individuals who have <span class="yellow">hepatitis B virus</span> (<span class="yellow">HBV</span>); worldwide more than 15 million people are co-infected. There are eight reported genotypes of <span class="yellow">HDV</span> with unexplained variations in their geographical distribution and pathogenicity. The <span class="blue">hepatitis D</span> virion is composed of a coat of <span class="yellow">HBV</span> envelope proteins surrounding the nucleocapsid, which consists of a single-stranded, circular RNA genome complexed with delta antigen, the <span class="yellow">viral</span> protein. <span class="yellow">HDV</span> is clinically important because although it suppresses <span class="yellow">HBV</span> replication, it causes severe liver disease with rapid progression to cirrhosis and hepatic decompensation. The range of clinical presentation is wide, varying from mild disease to fulminant liver failure. The prevalence of <span class="yellow">HDV</span> is declining in some endemic areas but increasing in northern and central Europe because of immigration. Treatment of <span class="yellow">HDV</span> is with pegylated interferon alfa; however, response rates are poor. Increased understanding of the molecular virology of <span class="yellow">HDV</span> will identify novel therapeutic targets for this most severe form of chronic <span class="yellow">viral</span> hepatitis.
