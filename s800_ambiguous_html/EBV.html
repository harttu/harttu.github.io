<h2>EBV</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20980506</h3>A new model of <span class="yellow">Epstein-Barr virus</span> infection reveals an important role for earlylytic <span class="yellow">viral</span> protein expression in the development of lymphomas.

<span class="yellow">Epstein-Barr virus</span> (<span class="blue">EBV</span>) infects cells in latent or lytic forms, but the roleof lytic infection in <span class="blue">EBV</span>-induced lymphomas is unclear. Here, we have used anew humanized <span class="yellow">mouse</span> model, in which both <span class="yellow">human</span> fetal CD34(+) hematopoietic stemcells and thymus/liver tissue are transplanted, to compare <span class="blue">EBV</span> pathogenesis andlymphoma formation following infection with a lytic replication-defectiveBZLF1-deleted (Z-KO) <span class="yellow">virus</span> or a lytically active BZLF1(+) control. Both thecontrol and Z-KO viruses established long-term <span class="yellow">viral</span> latency in all infectedanimals. The infection appeared well controlled in some animals, but otherseventually developed CD20(+) diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL). Animalsinfected with the control <span class="yellow">virus</span> developed tumors more frequently than Z-KOvirus-infected animals. Specific immune responses against <span class="blue">EBV</span>-infected B cellswere generated in <span class="yellow">mice</span> infected with either the control <span class="yellow">virus</span> or the Z-KOvirus. In both cases, forms of <span class="yellow">viral</span> latency (type I and type IIB) wereobserved that are less immunogenic than the highly transforming form (type III)commonly found in tumors of immunocompromised hosts, suggesting that immunepressure contributed to the outcome of the infection. These results point to animportant role for lytic <span class="blue">EBV</span> infection in the development of B cell lymphomasin the context of an active host immune response.
