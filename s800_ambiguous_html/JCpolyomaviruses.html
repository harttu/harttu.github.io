<h2>JC polyomaviruses</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20863853</h3>Detection and quantitation of infectious <span class="yellow">human adenoviruses</span> and <span class="blue">JC polyomaviruses</span> in water by immunofluorescence assay. 

Human adenoviruses (HAdV) and <span class="red">JC polyomaviruses</span> (JCPyV) have been proposed as markers of fecal/urine contamination of <span class="yellow">human</span> origin. An indirect immunofluorescence assay has been developed to quantify infectious <span class="yellow">human adenoviruses</span> types 2 and 41 and <span class="blue">JC polyomaviruses</span> strain Mad-4 in water samples. The immunofluorescence assay was compared with other quantitative techniques used commonly such as plaque assay, tissue culture infectious dose-50 and quantitative PCR (qPCR). The immunofluorescence assays showed to be specific for the detection of infectious viruses, obtaining negative results when UV or heat-inactivated viruses were analyzed. The assays required less time and showed higher sensitivity for the detection of infectious <span class="yellow">viral</span> particles than other cell culture techniques (1 log(10) more) evaluated. River water samples spiked previously with <span class="yellow">human</span><span class="yellow">human adenoviruses</span> and raw sewage samples were also analyzed using the proposed immunofluorescence assay as well as by qPCR. The results show quantitations with 2 log(10) reduction in the numbers of infectious viruses compared with the number of genome copies detected by qPCR. The immunofluorescence assay developed is fast, sensitive, specific, and a standardizable technique for the quantitation and detection of infectious viruses in water samples.
