<h2>Entamoeba hartmanni</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21295520</h3>Increased sampling reveals novel lineages of Entamoeba: consequences of genetic diversity and host specificity for taxonomy and molecular detection. 

To expand the representation for phylogenetic analysis, ten additional complete Entamoeba small-subunit rRNA gene sequences were obtained from <span class="yellow">humans</span>, non-human primates, <span class="yellow">cattle</span> and a tortoise. For some novel sequences no corresponding morphological data were available, and we suggest that these organisms should be referred to as ribosomal lineages (RL) rather than being assigned species names at present. To investigate genetic diversity and host specificity of selected Entamoeba species, a total of 91 new partial small subunit rRNA gene sequences were obtained, including 49 from <span class="yellow">Entamoeba coli</span>, 18 from <span class="yellow">Entamoeba polecki</span>, and 17 from <span class="blue">Entamoeba hartmanni</span>. We propose a new nomenclature for significant variants within established Entamoeba species. Based on current data we propose that the uninucleated-cyst-producing Entamoeba infecting <span class="yellow">humans</span> is called <span class="yellow">Entamoeba polecki</span> and divided into four subtypes (ST1-ST4) and that <span class="yellow">Entamoeba coli</span> is divided into two subtypes (ST1-ST2). New hosts for several species were detected and, while host specificity and genetic diversity of several species remain to be clarified, it is clear that previous reliance on cultivated material has given us a misleading and incomplete picture of variation within the genus Entamoeba.
