</br>
Infestations of SB__house SI__flies , SB__Musca SI__domestica L . , are a continual problem around <b>poultry</b> establishments . 
</br>
Acute toxicity of two commercial SB__Bacillus SI__thuringiensis SI__variety SI__israelensis ( SB__Bti ) formulations ( water - dispersible granules and bran formulation ) was evaluated against larvae in the laboratory and against natural populations of SB__M SI__. SI__domestica larvae in the field applied in feed to SB__chickens and as topical applications in the <b>poultry</b> houses . 
</br>
Adding SB__Bti to SB__chicken feed is potentially an efficient measure for the management and control of SB__house SI__flies in caged - <b>poultry</b> facilities .
