<h2>poultry</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20951166</h3>Rapid detection of <span class="annotated ">Newcastle disease virus</span> replication in embryonated <span class="annotated ">chicken</span> eggs using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Newcastle disease virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">NDV</span>), an avian paramyxovirus, is an economically important disease of <span class="match annotated ">poultry</span> globally. Rapid methods to detect and differentiate the <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> are important to curtail the spread of this <span class="unannotated ">virus</span>. Nucleic acid based detection methods are routinely employed for diagnosis that suffer from the disadvantage of failure to discriminate viable <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> and non-infectious genome. However, <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> isolation remains the gold standard for diagnosis of field outbreaks. The sensitivity of <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> isolation was combined with nucleic acid based detection methods so that the time taken for confirmatory diagnosis could be considerably reduced while increasing sensitivity. Quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and conventional RT-PCR techniques were compared for the detection of <span class="annotated ">NDV</span> genome replication in 9-11-day-old embryonated <span class="annotated ">chicken</span> eggs (ECE) using the nucleoprotein (NP) gene of the <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> as a target. The results suggest that at least two to fourfold increase in cycle threshold (C(t)) values over the baseline C(t) value of samples lacking infectious <span class="unannotated ">virus</span>, would indicate live <span class="annotated ">NDV</span> replication. The limit of detection of <span class="annotated ">NDV</span> replication using qRT-PCR was 1x10(4.0) mean embryo infective doses (EID(50)). The earliest time point when live <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> replication was detectable by qRT-PCR or RT-PCR was 30h post-inoculation in ECE. 
<h3>21269678</h3>Emerging infectious diseases in southeast Asia: regional challenges to control.<br><br>Southeast Asia is a hotspot for emerging infectious diseases, including those with pandemic potential. Emerging infectious diseases have exacted heavy public health and economic tolls. Severe acute respiratory syndrome rapidly decimated the region's tourist industry. Influenza <span class="unannotated ">A</span> <span class="unannotated ">H5N1</span> has had a profound effect on the <span class="match unannotated ">poultry</span> industry. The reasons why southeast Asia is at risk from emerging infectious diseases are complex. The region is home to dynamic systems in which biological, social, ecological, and technological processes interconnect in ways that enable microbes to exploit new ecological niches. These processes include population growth and movement, urbanisation, changes in food production, agriculture and land use, water and sanitation, and the effect of health systems through generation of drug resistance. Southeast Asia is home to about 600 million <span class="linneaus_only ">people</span> residing in countries as diverse as Singapore, a city state with a gross domestic product (GDP) of US$37,500 per head, and Laos, until recently an overwhelmingly rural economy, with a GDP of US$890 per head. The regional challenges in control of emerging infectious diseases are formidable and range from influencing the factors that drive disease emergence, to making surveillance systems fit for purpose, and ensuring that regional governance mechanisms work effectively to improve control interventions. 
<h3>22182611</h3>Laboratory and Field Evaluation of Formulated <span class="annotated ">Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis</span> as a Feed Additive and Using Topical Applications for Control of <span class="annotated ">Musca domestica</span> (Diptera: Muscidae) Larvae in Caged-Poultry Manure. <br><br>Infestations of <span class="annotated ">house flies</span>, <span class="annotated ">Musca domestica</span> L., are a continual problem around <span class="match unannotated ">poultry</span> establishments. Acute toxicity of two commercial <span class="annotated ">Bacillus thuringiensis variety israelensis</span> (<span class="annotated ">Bti</span>) formulations (water-dispersible granules and bran formulation) was evaluated against larvae in the laboratory and against natural populations of <span class="annotated ">M. domestica</span> larvae in the field applied in feed to <span class="annotated ">chickens</span> and as topical applications in the <span class="match unannotated ">poultry</span> houses. Bioassay data showed that susceptibility of <span class="annotated ">M. domestica</span> larvae increased to a given concentration of <span class="annotated ">Bti</span> as the duration of exposure increased. In the laboratory studies, the LC(50) values of <span class="annotated ">Bti</span> for the larvae ranged between 65 and 77.4 mug/ml. In the field, a concentration of 10 g <span class="annotated ">Bti</span>/kg of feed resulted in 90% reduction of larvae at 4 wk after treatment. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> higher concentration (2 g/liter) of <span class="annotated ">Bti</span> in spray applications was not significantly more effective than the lower concentration of 1 g/liter. Adding <span class="annotated ">Bti</span> to <span class="annotated ">chicken</span> feed is potentially an efficient measure for the management and control of <span class="annotated ">house flies</span> in caged-poultry facilities.
