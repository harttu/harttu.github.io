<h2>B. burgdorferi</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20935092</h3>Whole-genome sequences of thirteen isolates of <span class="yellow">Borrelia burgdorferi</span>.<br><br><span class="yellow">Borrelia burgdorferi</span> is a causative agent of Lyme disease in North America and Eurasia. The first complete genome sequence of <span class="yellow">B. burgdorferi strain 31</span>, available for more than a decade, has assisted research on the pathogenesis of Lyme disease. Because a single genome sequence is not sufficient to understand the relationship between genotypic and geographic variation and disease phenotype, we determined the whole-genome sequences of 13 additional <span class="blue">B. burgdorferi</span> isolates that span the range of natural variation. These sequences should allow improved understanding of pathogenesis and provide a foundation for novel detection, diagnosis, and prevention strategies.
