<h2>tropical japonica rice</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20946420</h3>Association between nonsynonymous mutations of starch synthase IIa and starch quality in <span class="annotated ">rice</span> (<span class="annotated ">Oryza sativa</span>). <br><br>Starch quality is one of the most important agronomic traits in <span class="annotated ">Asian rice</span>, <span class="annotated ">Oryza sativa</span>. Starch synthase IIa (SsIIa) is a major candidate gene for starch quality variation. Within SsIIa, three nonsynonymous mutations in exon 8 have been shown to affect enzyme activity when expressed in <span class="annotated ">Escherichia coli</span>. To search for the variation in SsIIa that is responsible for starch quality variation in <span class="annotated ">rice</span>, we sequenced the SsIIa exon 8 region and measured starch quality as starch disintegration in alkali for 289 accessions of cultivated <span class="annotated ">rice</span> and 57 accessions of its wild ancestor, <span class="annotated ">Oryza rufipogon</span>. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> general linear model and nested clade analysis were used to identify the associations between the three nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and starch quality. Among the three nonsynonymous SNPs, we found strong evidence of association at one nucleotide site ('SNP 3'), corresponding to a Leu/Phe replacement at codon 781. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> second SNP, corresponding to a Val/Met replacement at codon 737, could potentially show an association with increased sample sizes. Variation in SsIIa enzyme activity is associated with the cohesiveness of <span class="annotated ">rice</span> grains when cooked, and our findings are consistent with selection for more cohesive grains during the domestication of <span class="match annotated ">tropical japonica rice</span>.
