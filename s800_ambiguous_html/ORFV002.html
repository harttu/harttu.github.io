</br>
ORFV002 was shown to colocalize and interact with NF - kappaB - p65 , and expression of <b>ORFV002</b> in cell cultures resulted in a reduced interaction of NF - kappaB - p65 with p300 , suggesting that <b>ORFV002</b> interferes with NF - kappaB - p65 / p300 association . 
</br>
Deletion of <b>ORFV002</b> from the OV - IA82 genome had no significant effect on ORFV pathogenesis in sheep , indicating that <b>ORFV002</b> is nonessential for virus virulence in the natural host .
