<h2>papaya</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21526935</h3>Assessment of attractiveness of <span class="yellow">cassava</span> as a roosting plant for the <span class="yellow">melon fly</span>, <span class="yellow">Bactrocera cucurbitae</span>, and the <span class="yellow">Oriental fruit fly</span>, <span class="yellow">B. dorsalis</span>. <br><br>Application of bait spray to crop borders is a standard approach for suppression of <span class="yellow">melon fly</span>, <span class="yellow">Bactrocera cucurbitae</span> (Coquillett) (Diptera: Tephritidae) populations and may also be of value for suppression of <span class="yellow">oriental fruit fly</span>, <span class="yellow">B. dorsalis</span> (Hendel) populations. Establishment of preferred roosting hosts as crop borders may help to improve suppression of both fruit fly species by providing sites for bait spray applications. In an area-wide <span class="yellow">B. cucurbitae</span> suppression trial, the question was raised as to whether <span class="yellow">cassava</span>, <span class="yellow">Manihot esculenta</span> Crantz (Euphorbiales: Euphorbiaceae), could be used as a <span class="yellow">B. cucurbitae</span> roosting host. <span class="yellow">M. esculenta</span> was of interest as a roosting host because, in contrast to many other identified preferred roosting hosts, it would also be a crop potentially increasing the productivity of the crop production system overall. As a short-lived and shrubby perennial, <span class="yellow">M. esculenta</span> potentially constitutes a crop with more persistent roosting foliage than an annual crop such as <span class="yellow">corn</span>, <span class="yellow">Zea mays</span> L. (Cyperales: Poaceae), that has often been planted as a roosting host for <span class="yellow">B. cucurbitae</span> control. Using protein-baited traps set amidst potted plants placed adjacent to a <span class="blue">papaya</span> <span class="yellow">Carica papaya</span> L. (Violales: Caricaceae) orchard known to have established populations of <span class="yellow">B. cucurbitae</span> and <span class="yellow">B. dorsalis</span>, the effectiveness of <span class="yellow">M. esculenta</span> as a roosting host was assessed by comparing its attractiveness to that of <span class="yellow">castor bean</span>, <span class="yellow">Ricinus communis</span> L (Malpighiales: Euphorbiaceae), previously identified as one of the most attractive roosting hosts for <span class="yellow">B. cucurbitae</span>, and to <span class="yellow">corn</span>, a crop which has been planted as a roosting host for help in <span class="yellow">B. cucurbitae</span> control. The results showed that use of <span class="yellow">M. esculenta</span> as a roosting host is comparable to use of <span class="yellow">R. communis</span> by both <span class="yellow">B. cucurbitae</span> and <span class="yellow">B. dorsalis</span>. These results provide encouragement to incorporate <span class="yellow">M. esculenta</span> on a farm as a trap crop (i.e. site for bait spray application). This has the advantage of having the trap crop be a crop on its own (as opposed to <span class="yellow">castor bean</span>) and, among prospective crops that could be used as a trap crop, has foliage more persistent than an annual trap crop such as <span class="yellow">corn</span>.
