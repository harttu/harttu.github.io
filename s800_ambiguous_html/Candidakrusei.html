<h2>Candida krusei</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21272794</h3>Emerging opportunistic <span class="yellow">yeast</span> infections.<br><br>A growing population of immunosuppressed patients has resulted in increasingly frequent diagnoses of invasive <span class="yellow">fungal</span> infections, including those caused by unusual <span class="yellow">yeasts</span>. The incidence of non-albicans species of Candida is increasing compared with that of <span class="yellow">Candida albicans</span>, and several species, such as <span class="yellow">Candida glabrata</span> and <span class="blue">Candida krusei</span>, may be resistant to azole antifungal therapy. Trichosporon species are the second most common cause of fungaemia in patients with haematological malignant disease and are characterised by resistance to amphotericin and echinocandins and poor prognosis. Rhodotorula species belong to the family Cryptococcaceae, and are a cause of catheter-related fungaemia, sepsis, and invasive disease in severely immunosuppressed patients. An increasing number of sporadic cases of invasive <span class="yellow">fungal</span> infections by non-neoformans cryptococci have been reported in immunocompromised hosts, especially for patients with advanced <span class="yellow">HIV</span> infection or cancer who are undergoing transplant. Other uncommon <span class="yellow">yeasts</span> that can cause invasive disease in severely immunosuppressed patients include Geotrichum, Hansenula, Malassezia, and Saccharomyces. Host immune status is a crucial determinant of the type of invasive <span class="yellow">fungal</span> infection a patient is at risk for. Diagnosis can be challenging and relies heavily on traditional cultures of blood and other sterile sites, although serum (1,3)-Beta-D-glucan testing might have an adjunctive role. Although rare <span class="yellow">yeasts</span> are emerging as opportunistic <span class="yellow">human</span> pathogens, diagnosis remains challenging and treatment suboptimal.
