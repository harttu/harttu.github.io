<h2>Sitophilus zeamais</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21496128</h3>Pyrethroid resistance in <span class="blue">Sitophilus zeamais</span> is associated with a mutation (T929I) in the voltage-gated sodium channel. 

The <span class="yellow">maize weevil</span>, <span class="blue">Sitophilus zeamais</span>, is the most important pest affecting stored grain in Brazil and its control relies heavily on the use of insecticides. The intensive use of compounds such as the pyrethroids has led to the emergence of resistance, and previous studies have suggested that resistance to both pyrethroids and 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) may result from reduced sensitivity of the insecticide target, the voltage-gated sodium channel. To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying pyrethroid resistance in <span class="yellow">S. zeamais</span>, the domain II region of the voltage-gated sodium channel (para-orthologue) gene was amplified by PCR and sequenced from susceptible and resistant laboratory <span class="yellow">S. zeamais</span> strains that were selected with a discriminating dose of DDT. <span class="yellow">A</span> single point mutation, T929I, was found in the para gene of the resistant <span class="yellow">S. zeamais</span> populations and its presence in individual weevils was strongly associated with survival after DDT exposure. This is the first identification of a target-site resistance mutation in <span class="yellow">S. zeamais</span> and unusually it is a super-kdr type mutation occurring in the absence of the more common kdr (L1014F) substitution. <span class="yellow">A</span> high-throughput assay based on TaqMan single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping was developed for sensitive detection of the mutation and used to screen field-collected strains of <span class="yellow">S. zeamais</span>. This showed that the mutation is present at low frequency in field populations and is a useful tool for informing control strategies.
