<h2>Jiangella muralis sp. nov.</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20173006</h3><span class="blue">Jiangella muralis sp. nov.</span>, from an indoor environment.

A Gram-stain-positive, non-spore-forming actinobacterium, designated <span class="yellow">15-Je-017(T)</span>, was isolated from wall material of an indoor environment. The isolate formed a rudimentary substrate mycelium that fragmented into rod-shaped cells. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain <span class="yellow">15-Je-017(T)</span> was shown to belong to the genus Jiangella and was most closely related to <span class="yellow">Jiangella alba YIM 61503(T)</span> (99.7 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), <span class="yellow">Jiangella alkaliphila D8-87(T)</span> (99.0 %) and <span class="yellow">Jiangella gansuensis YIM 002(T)</span> (99.0 %). The predominant menaquinone was MK-9(H(4)). Whole-cell hydrolysates contained ll-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid in the cell wall and rhamnose and glucose as the main sugars. Mycolic acids were absent. The polar lipid profile consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol mannoside and seven unknown phospholipids. The fatty acid profile contained major amounts (>5 %) of anteiso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(16 : 0), iso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(17 : 0), anteiso-C(17 : 0) and C(17 : 1)omega8c, which supported the affiliation of strain <span class="yellow">15-Je-017(T)</span> to the genus Jiangella. DNA-DNA relatedness and physiological and biochemical tests allowed the differentiation of strain <span class="yellow">15-Je-017(T)</span> from the type strains of the three known Jiangella species. Strain <span class="yellow">15-Je-017(T)</span> represents a novel Jiangella species, for which we propose the name <span class="blue">Jiangella muralis sp. nov.</span>, with type strain <span class="yellow">15-Je-017(T)</span> (=DSM 45357(T) =CCM 7680(T)).
