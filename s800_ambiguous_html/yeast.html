</br>
Acetate , coenzyme M , vitamins and <b>yeast</b> extract were required for growth . 
</br>
The role of Rgd1 in survival at low pH is conserved in the two <b>yeast</b> species as the CaRGD1 gene complements the Scrgd1Delta sensitivity . 
</br>
By tagging the RhoGAP with GFP , we found that CaRgd1 is localized at the tip and cortex of growing cells and during cytokinesis at the septation sites in <b>yeast</b> and filamentous forms . 
</br>
We describe here the functions of a Snf1 / AMPK homolog in the human pathogenic <b>yeast</b> Cryptococcus neoformans , strain SB__JEC21 . 
</br>
Here we characterized a SB__Cryptococcus SI__neoformans gene , which is homologous to the <b>yeast</b> Ste50 that is known to play an important role in mating pheromone response and stress response as an adaptor protein to the Ste11 MAPK kinase kinase in SB__Saccharomyces SI__cerevisiae . 
</br>
Finally , using comprehensive <b>yeast</b> two - hybrid screens , we identified 156 phage protein interactions , and this intraviral interactome was used to propose a structural model of Dp - 1 . 
</br>
Emerging opportunistic <b>yeast</b> infections . 
</br>
Identification and characterization of putative osmosensors , HwSho1A and HwSho1B , from the extremely halotolerant black <b>yeast</b> SB__Hortaea SI__werneckii . 
</br>
Two novel SHO1 - like genes , HwSHO1A and HwSHO1B , have been cloned from the saltern - inhabiting , extremely halotolerant black <b>yeast</b> SB__Hortaea SI__werneckii . 
</br>
Differential PbP27 expression in the <b>yeast</b> and mycelial forms of the SB__Paracoccidioides SI__brasiliensis species complex . 
</br>
In order to determine if there was a differential expression pattern between morphological states and among isolates , we also evaluated PbP27 expression , at transcriptional and translational levels , in mycelia and <b>yeast</b> cultures in 14 isolates belonging to the SB__P SI__. SI__brasiliensis SI__species SI__complex ( S1 , PS2 , PS3 , and " Pb01 - like " , proposed to be named SB__Paracoccidioides SI__lutzii ) by two techniques , real time RT - PCR ( RT - qPCR ) and protein dot blot . 
</br>
We found that p27 was present in all isolates , mainly in the <b>yeast</b> form . 
</br>
This pattern was corroborated by RT - qPCR results , with higher expression levels found in the <b>yeast</b> form for most of the isolates . 
</br>
SB__Candida SI__albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that grows as budding <b>yeast</b> , pseudohyphal , and hyphal forms .

SB__Candida SI__albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that grows as budding <b>yeast</b> , pseudohyphal , and hyphal forms . 
</br>
The strain grew aerobically and was capable of chemolithotrophic growth on thiosulfate and hydrogen , heterotrophic growth on pyruvate , oxalate , acetate and on glutamate in the presence of <b>yeast</b> extract and mixotrophic growth on several organic compounds , thiosulfate and / or hydrogen .
