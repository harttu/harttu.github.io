<h2>yeast</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20139282</h3>Proposal of Mingxiaea gen. nov. for the anamorphic basidiomycetous <span class="blue">yeast</span> species in the Bulleribasidium clade (Tremellales) based on molecular phylogenetic analysis, with six new combinations and four novel species. <br><br>The distinction and monophyletic property of the basidiomycetous <span class="blue">yeast</span> species in the Bulleribasidium clade of the order Tremellales was resolved by molecular phylogenetic analysis based on the combined sequences of the 18S rRNA gene, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region including 5.8S rRNA gene and 26S rRNA gene D1/D2 domain. The addition to the clade of new anamorphic species identified among ballistoconidium-forming <span class="yellow">yeasts</span> isolated from China confirmed and strengthened the separation of this clade from other clades or lineages in the order Tremellales. <span class="yellow">A</span> new anamorphic genus, Mingxiaea gen. nov. (type species Mingxiaea variabilis comb. nov.) is therefore proposed to accommodate the anamorphic species in the Bulleribasidium clade. Six new combinations are proposed for the described species of this clade which were formerly assigned to the genus Bullera. Four novel species in the new genus were identified among 16 ballistoconidium-forming <span class="blue">yeast</span> strains isolated from plant leaves collected in Hainan province, southern China, by D1/D2 and ITS sequence analyses. The novel species are described as Mingxiaea sanyaensis sp. nov. (type strain SY-3.23(T) =AS 2. 3623(T) =CBS 11408(T)), Mingxiaea hainanensis (type strain WZS-8.13(T) =AS 2.4161(T) =CBS 11409(T)), Mingxiaea foliicola (type strain WZS-8.14(T) =AS 2.3518(T) =CBS 11407(T)) and Mingxiaea wuzhishanensis (type strain WZS-29.8(T) =AS 2.4163(T) =CBS 11411(T)). 
<h3>20154331</h3><span class="yellow">Methanoregula boonei gen. nov., sp. nov.</span>, an acidiphilic methanogen isolated from an acidic peat bog. <br><br>A novel acidiphilic, hydrogenotrophic methanogen, designated strain <span class="yellow">6A8</span>(T), was isolated from an acidic (pH 4.0-4.5) and ombrotrophic (rain-fed) bog located near Ithaca, NY, USA. Cultures were dimorphic, containing thin rods (0.2-0.3 mum in diameter and 0.8-3.0 mum long) and irregular cocci (0.2-0.8 mum in diameter). The culture utilized H(2)/CO(2) to produce methane but did not utilize formate, acetate, methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, butanol or trimethylamine. Optimal growth conditions were near pH 5.1 and 35 ^0C. The culture grew in basal medium containing as little as 0.43 mM Na(+) and growth was inhibited completely by 50 mM NaCl. To our knowledge, strain <span class="yellow">6A8</span>(T) is one of the most acidiphilic (lowest pH optimum) and salt-sensitive methanogens in pure culture. Acetate, coenzyme M, vitamins and <span class="red">yeast</span> extract were required for growth. It is proposed that a new genus and species be established for this organism, <span class="yellow">Methanoregula boonei gen. nov., sp. nov.</span> The type strain of <span class="yellow">Methanoregula boonei</span> is <span class="yellow">6A8</span>(T) (=DSM 21154(T) =JCM 14090(T)). 
<h3>20173012</h3>Sporosalibacterium faouarense gen. nov., sp. nov., a moderately halophilic bacterium isolated from oil-contaminated soil. <br><br>A novel strictly anaerobic, moderately halophilic and mesophilic bacterium, designated strain SOL3f37(T), was isolated from a hydrocarbon-polluted soil surrounding a deep petroleum environment located in south Tunisia. Cells of strain SOL3f37(T) stained Gram-positive and were motile, straight and spore-forming. Strain SOL3f37(T) had a typical Gram-positive-type cell-wall structure, unlike the thick, multilayered cell wall of its closest relative <span class="yellow">Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans</span>. The major fatty acids were iso-C(15 : 0) (41 %), iso-C(14 : 0) 3-OH and/or iso-C(15 : 0) dimethyl acetal (21.6 %), iso-C(13 : 0) (4.4 %), anteiso-C(15 : 0) (3.9 %) and iso-C(15 : 1) (2.8 %). Strain SOL3f37(T) grew between 20 and 48 ^0C (optimum 40 ^0C) and at pH 6.2-8.1 (optimum pH 6.9). Strain SOL3f37(T) required at least 0.5 NaCl l(-1) and grew in the presence of NaCl concentrations up to 150 g l(-1) (optimum 40 g l(-1)). <span class="yellow">Yeast</span> extract (2 g l(-1)) was required for degradation of pyruvate, fumarate, fructose, glucose and mannitol. Also, strain SOL3f37(T) grew heterotrophically on <span class="blue">yeast</span> extract, peptone and bio-Trypticase, but was unable to grow on Casamino acids. Sulfate, thiosulfate, sulfite, elemental sulfur, fumarate, nitrate and nitrite were not reduced. The DNA G+C content was 30.7 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain SOL3f37(T) was a member of the family Clostridiaceae in the order Clostridiales; strain SOL3f37(T) was related to members of various genera of the family Clostridiaceae. It exhibited highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (93.4 %) with <span class="yellow">Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans</span> 37HS60(T), 91.8 % with <span class="yellow">Thermohalobacter berrensis</span> CTT3(T) and 91.7 % with <span class="yellow">Caloranaerobacter azorensis</span> MV1087(T). On the basis of genotypic, phenotypic and phylogenetic data, it is suggested that strain SOL3f37(T) represents a novel species in a new genus. The name Sporosalibacterium faouarense gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed, with SOL3f37(T) (=DSM 21485(T) =JCM 15487(T)) as the type strain of Sporosalibacterium faouarense. 
<h3>20173013</h3>Streptomyces lacticiproducens sp. nov., a lactic acid-producing streptomycete isolated from the rhizosphere of <span class="yellow">tomato</span><span class="yellow">tomato plants</span>. <br><br>A novel actinomycete, designated strain GIMN4.001(T), was isolated from the rhizosphere of <span class="yellow">tomato</span><span class="yellow">tomato plants</span> grown in Guangzhou, China. The strain produced greyish white aerial mycelia, lactic acid and a large quantity of double diamond-shaped crystals on <span class="yellow">potato</span> dextrose agar and <span class="blue">yeast</span> extract-malt extract agar. The colour of the substrate mycelium was not sensitive to pH. Microscopic observations revealed that strain GIMN4.001(T) produced verticillate chains of cylindrical spores. Chemotaxonomic data confirmed that strain GIMN4.001(T) belonged to the genus Streptomyces. Melanin pigments were not produced. No antibacterial activity was observed against <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span>, <span class="yellow">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>, <span class="yellow">Bacillus subtilis</span> or <span class="yellow">Candida albicans</span>, but inhibitory activity was observed against <span class="yellow">Penicillium citrinum</span>. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain GIMN4.001(T) was related most closely to <span class="yellow">Streptomyces morookaense</span> <span class="yellow">ATCC 19166(T)</span> (98.9 % similarity) and <span class="yellow">Streptomyces lavenduligriseus</span> <span class="yellow">ATCC 13306(T)</span> (98.7 %). Levels of DNA-DNA relatedness between strain GIMN4.001(T) and the type strains of these species were low (14-20 %). Furthermore, strain GIMN4.001(T) could be differentiated from <span class="yellow">S. morookaense</span>, S. lavenduligriseus and other closely related species of the genus Streptomyces based on morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics. On the basis of its physiological and molecular properties, strain GIMN4.001(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces lacticiproducens sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is GIMN4.001(T) (=CCTCC M208214(T)=NRRL B-24800(T)). 
<h3>20637818</h3>The <span class="yellow">Candida albicans</span> Rgd1 is a RhoGAP protein involved in the control of filamentous growth. <br><br>Rho proteins are essential regulators of polarized growth in eukaryotic cells. These proteins are down-regulated in vivo by specific Rho GTPase Activating Proteins (RhoGAP). We investigated the role of Rgd1 RhoGAP, encoded by the <span class="yellow">Candida albicans</span> RGD1 gene. We demonstrated that CaCdc42, CaRho3 and CaRho4 proteins had an intrinsic GTPase activity and that CaRgd1 stimulates in vitro GTP hydrolysis of these GTPases. Deletion of RGD1 in <span class="yellow">C. albicans</span> results in sensitivity to low pH as already described for rgd1Delta in <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>. The role of Rgd1 in survival at low pH is conserved in the two <span class="red">yeast</span> species as the CaRGD1 gene complements the Scrgd1Delta sensitivity. By tagging the RhoGAP with GFP, we found that CaRgd1 is localized at the tip and cortex of growing cells and during cytokinesis at the septation sites in <span class="red">yeast</span> and filamentous forms. We investigated the effect of CaRgd1 on the control of the polarized growth. Removing CaRGD1 alleles increased filamentous growth and cells lacking CaRgd1 presented longer germ tubes. Conversely, RGD1 overexpression restricted hyphae growth. Our results demonstrate that Rgd1 is critical for filamentous formation in <span class="yellow">C. albicans</span> especially for filamentous elongation. 
<h3>20713166</h3>Characterization of the <span class="yellow">Aspergillus nidulans</span> biotin biosynthetic gene cluster and use of the bioDA gene as a new transformation marker. <br><br>The genes involved in the biosynthesis of biotin were identified in the hyphal fungus <span class="yellow">Aspergillus nidulans</span> through homology searches and complementation of <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span> biotin-auxotrophic mutants. Whereas the 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid synthase and dethiobiotin synthetase are encoded by distinct genes in bacteria and the <span class="blue">yeast</span> <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, both activities are performed in <span class="yellow">A. nidulans</span> by a single enzyme, encoded by the bifunctional gene bioDA. Such a bifunctional bioDA gene is a genetic feature common to numerous members of the ascomycete filamentous fungi and basidiomycetes, as well as in plants and oomycota. However, unlike in other eukaryota, the three bio genes contributing to the four enzymatic steps from pimeloyl-CoA to biotin are organized in a gene cluster in pezizomycotina. The <span class="yellow">A. nidulans</span> auxotrophic mutants biA1, biA2 and biA3 were all found to have mutations in the 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid synthase domain of the bioDA gene. Although biotin auxotrophy is an inconvenient marker in classical genetic manipulations due to cross-feeding of biotin, transformation of the biA1 mutant with the bioDA gene from either <span class="yellow">A. nidulans</span> or <span class="yellow">Aspergillus fumigatus</span> led to the recovery of well-defined biotin-prototrophic colonies. The usefulness of bioDA gene as a novel and robust transformation marker was demonstrated in co-transformation experiments with a green fluorescent protein reporter, and in the efficient deletion of the laccase (yA) gene via homologous recombination in a mutant lacking non-homologous end-joining activity. 
<h3>20719250</h3>Regulation of virulence factors, carbon utilization and virulence by SNF1 in <span class="yellow">Cryptococcus neoformans JEC21</span> and divergent actions of SNF1 between cryptococcal strains. <br><br>We describe here the functions of a Snf1/AMPK homolog in the <span class="yellow">human</span> pathogenic <span class="red">yeast</span> <span class="yellow">Cryptococcus neoformans</span>, strain <span class="yellow">JEC21</span>. We found that <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1 is a key regulator for the biosynthesis of the major virulence factors, stress resistance and alternative carbon source utilization. Disruption of <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1 results in defects of laccase activity and capsule production, sensitivity to cation stress. Especially, we found that <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1 is essential for growth at elevated temperature and for thermotolerance. To our knowledge, a role for Snf1 proteins in thermotolerance has not been reported. Furthermore, we observed a functional divergence between <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1 and its equivalent from <span class="yellow">serotype A</span><span class="yellow">A</span> strain <span class="yellow">H99</span>. <span class="yellow">A</span> high temperature is needed for <span class="yellow">H99</span> SNF1 to function in stress response and carbon source preference, but not for the <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1. Our results confirmed a critical role of <span class="yellow">JEC21</span> SNF1 in regulation of stress response and virulence. Revelation of divergent actions of SNF1 may help to understand the evolution of cryptococcal pathogenesis and provides insights into the strain-associated biosynthesis of virulence factors. 
<h3>20728557</h3>General factors important for the formation of structured biofilm-like <span class="blue">yeast</span> colonies. <br><br>The lifestyle of wild and laboratory <span class="blue">yeast</span> strains significantly differs. In contrast to the smooth colonies of laboratory strains, wild <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> strains form biofilm-like, strikingly structured colonies possessing distinctive traits enabling them to better survive in hostile environments in the wild. Here, comparing three sets of strains forming differently structured colonies (fluffy, semi-fluffy and smooth), each derived from ancestors with distinct genetic backgrounds isolated from natural settings (BR-88, BR-99 and BR-103), we specified the factors essential for the formation of structured colonies, i.e. for the lifestyle most likely to be preferred in the wild. The ability to form an abundant extracellular matrix (ECM) is one of the features typical for structured colonies. ECM influences colony architecture and many other physiological properties, such as the capability to retain water in a 2-fold surplus to wet cell biomass. ECM composition, however, differs among distinct strains, depending on their particular genetic background. We further show that the expression of certain genes (AQY1, FLO11) is also strictly related to the particular colony morphology, being highest in the most structured colonies. Flo11p adhesin, important for cell-cell and cell-surface adhesion, is essential for the formation of fluffy colonies and thus significantly contributes to the phenotype variability of wild <span class="blue">yeast</span> strains. On the other hand, surprisingly, neither the cell shape nor budding pattern nor the ability to form pseudohyphae directly influences the formation of three-dimensional fluffy colony architecture. 
<h3>20817115</h3>Characterization of the developmental regulator FlbE in <span class="yellow">Aspergillus fumigatus</span> and <span class="yellow">Aspergillus nidulans</span>. <br><br>Several upstream developmental activators control asexual development (conidiation) in Aspergillus. In this study, we characterize one of such activators called flbE in <span class="yellow">Aspergillus fumigatus</span> and <span class="yellow">Aspergillus nidulans</span>. The predicted FlbE protein is composed of 222 and 201 aa in <span class="yellow">A. fumigatus</span> and <span class="yellow">A. nidulans</span>, respectively. While flbE is transiently expressed during early phase of growth in <span class="yellow">A. nidulans</span>, it is somewhat constitutively expressed during the lifecycle of <span class="yellow">A. fumigatus</span>. The deletion of flbE causes reduced conidiation and delayed expression of brlA and vosA in both species. Moreover, FlbE is necessary for salt-induced development in liquid submerged culture in <span class="yellow">A. fumigatus</span>. The <span class="yellow">A. nidulans</span> flbE null mutation is fully complemented by <span class="yellow">A. fumigatus</span> flbE, indicating a functional conservancy of FlbE in Aspergillus. Both the deletion and overexpression of flbE in <span class="yellow">A. nidulans</span> result in developmental defects, enhanced autolysis, precocious cell death, and delayed expression of brlA/vosA, suggesting that balanced activity of FlbE is crucial for proper growth and development. Importantly, the N-terminal portion of FlbE exhibits the trans-activation ability in <span class="blue">yeast</span>, whereas the C-terminal half negatively affects its activity. Site-directed mutagenesis of certain conserved N-terminal amino acids abolishes the ability of trans-activation, overexpression-induced autolysis, and complementing the null mutation. Finally, overexpression of flbD, but not flbB or flbC, restores conidiation in <span class="yellow">A. nidulans</span> DeltaflbE, generally supporting the current genetic model for developmental regulation. 
<h3>20840506</h3>OsHMA3, a P1B-type of ATPase affects root-to-shoot cadmium translocation in <span class="yellow">rice</span> by mediating efflux into vacuoles. <br><br>* The cadmium (Cd) over-accumulating <span class="yellow">rice</span> (<span class="yellow">Oryza sativa</span>) <span class="yellow">cv Cho-Ko-Koku</span> was previously shown to have an enhanced rate of root-to-shoot Cd translocation. This trait is controlled by a single recessive allele located at qCdT7. * In this study, using positional cloning and transgenic strategies, heavy metal ATPase 3 (OsHMA3) was identified as the gene that controls root-to-shoot Cd translocation rates. The subcellular localization and Cd-transporting activity of the gene products were also investigated. * The allele of OsHMA3 that confers high root-to-shoot Cd translocation rates (OsHMA3mc) encodes a defective P(1B) -ATPase transporter. OsHMA3 fused to green fluorescent protein was localized to vacuolar membranes in plants and <span class="blue">yeast</span>. An OsHMA3 transgene complemented Cd sensitivity in a <span class="blue">yeast</span> mutant that lacks the ability to transport Cd into vacuoles. By contrast, OsHMA3mc did not complement the Cd sensitivity of this <span class="blue">yeast</span> mutant, indicating that the OsHMA3mc transport function was lost. * We propose that the root cell cytoplasm of Cd-overaccumulating <span class="yellow">rice plants</span> has more Cd available for loading into the xylem as a result of the lack of OsHMA3-mediated transportation of Cd to the vacuoles. This defect results in Cd translocation to the shoots in higher concentrations. These data demonstrate the importance of vacuolar sequestration for Cd accumulation in <span class="yellow">rice</span>. 
<h3>20962080</h3>Identification of binary interactions between <span class="yellow">human cytomegalovirus</span> virion proteins. <br><br><span class="yellow">Human cytomegalovirus</span> (<span class="yellow">HCMV</span>) virions are composed of a DNA-containing nucleocapsid surrounded by a tegument layer and host-derived lipid envelope studded with virally encoded glycoproteins. These complex virions are estimated to be composed of more than 50 <span class="yellow">viral</span> proteins. Assembly of <span class="yellow">HCMV</span> virions is poorly understood, especially with respect to acquisition of the tegument; however, it is thought to involve the stepwise addition of virion components through protein-protein interactions. We sought to identify interactions among <span class="yellow">HCMV</span> virion proteins using <span class="blue">yeast</span> two-hybrid analysis. Using 33 known capsid and tegument proteins, we tested 1,089 pairwise combinations for binary interaction in the two-hybrid assay. We identified 24 interactions among <span class="yellow">HCMV</span> virion proteins, including 13 novel interactions among tegument proteins and one novel interaction between capsid proteins. Several of these novel interactions were confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of protein complexes from transfected cells. In addition, we demonstrate three of these interactions in the context of <span class="yellow">HCMV</span> infection. This study reveals several new protein-protein interactions among <span class="yellow">HCMV</span> tegument proteins, some of which are likely important for <span class="yellow">HCMV</span> replication and pathogenesis. 
<h3>20962094</h3><span class="yellow">Yeast</span>-elicited cross-reactive antibodies to <span class="yellow">HIV</span> Env glycans efficiently neutralize virions expressing exclusively high-mannose N-linked glycans. <br><br>The <span class="yellow">HIV</span> envelope (Env) protein uses a dense coat of glycans to mask conserved domains and evade host humoral immune responses. The broadly neutralizing antibody 2G12, which binds a specific cluster of high-mannose glycans on <span class="yellow">HIV</span> Env, shows that the glycan shield can also serve as a target for neutralizing antibodies. We have described a triple mutant <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> strain that expresses high-mannose glycoproteins that bind to 2G12. When used to immunize <span class="yellow">rabbits</span>, this <span class="blue">yeast</span> elicits antibodies that bind to gp120-associated glycans but fail to neutralize <span class="yellow">virus</span>. Here we sought to determine the reason for these discordant results. Affinity purification of sera over columns conjugated with three 2G12-reactive <span class="blue">yeast</span> glycoproteins showed that these proteins could adsorb 80% of the antibodies that bind to gp120 glycans. Despite binding to monomeric gp120, these mannose-specific antibodies failed to bind cell surface-expressed trimeric Env. However, when Env was expressed in the presence of the mannosidase inhibitor kifunensine to force retention of high-mannose glycans at all sites, the purified antibodies gained the abilities to bind trimeric Env and to strongly and broadly neutralize viruses produced under these conditions. Combined, these data show that the triple mutant <span class="blue">yeast</span> strain elicits antibodies that bind to high-mannose glycans presented on the <span class="yellow">HIV</span> envelope, but only when they are displayed in a manner not found on native Env trimers. This implies that the underlying structure of the protein scaffold used to present the high-mannose glycans may be critical to allow elicitation of antibodies that recognize trimeric Env and neutralize <span class="yellow">virus</span>. 
<h3>20962095</h3>Role of RNase MRP in <span class="yellow">viral</span> RNA degradation and RNA recombination.<br><br>RNA degradation, together with RNA synthesis, controls the steady-state level of <span class="yellow">viral</span> RNAs in infected cells. The endoribonucleolytic cleavage of <span class="yellow">viral</span> RNA is important not only for <span class="yellow">viral</span> RNA degradation but for RNA recombination as well, due to the participation of some RNA degradation products in the RNA recombination process. To identify host endoribonucleases involved in degradation of <span class="yellow">Tomato bushy stunt virus</span> (<span class="yellow">TBSV</span>) in a <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> model host, we tested eight known endoribonucleases. Here we report that downregulation of SNM1, encoding a component of the RNase MRP, and a temperature-sensitive mutation in the NME1 gene, coding for the RNA component of RNase MRP, lead to reduced production of the endoribonucleolytically cleaved <span class="yellow">TBSV</span> RNA in <span class="blue">yeast</span>. We also show that the highly purified <span class="blue">yeast</span> RNase MRP cleaves the <span class="yellow">TBSV</span> RNA in vitro, resulting in <span class="yellow">TBSV</span> RNA degradation products similar in size to those observed in <span class="blue">yeast</span> cells. Knocking down the NME1 homolog in <span class="yellow">Nicotiana benthamiana</span> also led to decreased production of the cleaved <span class="yellow">TBSV</span> RNA, suggesting that in plants, RNase MRP is involved in <span class="yellow">TBSV</span> RNA degradation. Altogether, this work suggests a role for the host endoribonuclease RNase MRP in <span class="yellow">viral</span> RNA degradation and recombination. 
<h3>20971202</h3>Ste50 adaptor protein governs sexual differentiation of <span class="yellow">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> via the pheromone-response MAPK signaling pathway. <br><br>The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways control diverse cellular functions in pathogenic fungi, including sexual differentiation, stress response, and maintenance of cell wall integrity. Here we characterized a <span class="yellow">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> gene, which is homologous to the <span class="red">yeast</span> Ste50 that is known to play an important role in mating pheromone response and stress response as an adaptor protein to the Ste11 MAPK kinase kinase in <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>. The <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span> Ste50 was not involved in any of the stress responses or virulence factor production (capsule and melanin) that are controlled by the HOG and Ras/cAMP signaling pathways. However, Ste50 was required for mating in both <span class="yellow">serotype A</span> and <span class="yellow">serotype D C. neoformans</span> strains. The ste50Delta mutant was completely defective in cell-cell fusion and mating pheromone production. Double mutation of the STE50 gene blocked increased production of pheromone and the hyper-filamentation phenotype of cells deleted of the CRG1 gene, which encodes the RGS protein that negatively regulates pheromone responsive G-protein signaling via the MAPK pathway. Regardless of the presence of the basidiomycota-specific SH3 domains of Ste50 that are known to be required for full virulence of <span class="yellow">Ustilago maydis</span>, Ste50 was dispensable for virulence of <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span> in a murine model of cryptococcosis. In conclusion, the Ste50 adaptor protein controls sexual differentiation of <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span> via the pheromone-responsive MAPK pathway but is not required for virulence. 
<h3>21047956</h3>Genetic analysis of B55alpha/Cdc55 protein phosphatase 2A subunits: association with the <span class="yellow">adenovirus</span> E4orf4 protein. <br><br>The <span class="yellow">human</span><span class="yellow">human adenovirus</span> E4orf4 protein is toxic in both <span class="yellow">human</span> tumor cells and <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>. Previous studies indicated that most of this toxicity is dependent on an interaction of E4orf4 protein with the B55 class of regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and in <span class="blue">yeast</span> with the B55 homolog Cdc55. We have found previously that E4orf4 inhibits PP2A activity against at least some substrates. In an attempt to understand the mechanism of this inhibition, we used a genetic approach to identify residues in the seven-bladed Beta-propeller proteins B55alpha and Cdc55 required for E4orf4 binding. In both cases, amino-terminal polypeptides composed only of blade 1 and at least part of blade 2 were found to bind E4orf4 and overexpression blocked E4orf4 toxicity in <span class="blue">yeast</span>. Furthermore, certain amino acid substitutions in blades 1 and 2 within full-length B55alpha and Cdc55 resulted in loss of E4orf4 binding. Recent mutational analysis has suggested that segments of blades 1 and 2 present on the top face of B55alpha form part of the &quot;substrate-binding groove.&quot; Additionally, these segments are in close proximity to the catalytic C subunit of the PP2A holoenzyme. Thus, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that E4orf4 binding could affect the access of substrates, resulting in the failure to dephosphorylate some PP2A substrates. 
<h3>21094264</h3>Genome-wide inventory of metal homeostasis-related gene products including a functional phytochelatin synthase in the hypogeous mycorrhizal fungus <span class="yellow">Tuber melanosporum</span>. <br><br>Ectomycorrhizal fungi are thought to enhance mineral nutrition of their host plants and to confer increased tolerance toward toxic metals. However, a global view of metal homeostasis-related genes and pathways in these organisms is still lacking. Building upon the genome sequence of <span class="yellow">Tuber melanosporum</span> and on transcriptome analyses, we set out to systematically identify metal homeostasis-related genes in this plant-symbiotic ascomycete. Candidate gene products (101) were subdivided into three major functional classes: (i) metal transport (58); (ii) oxidative stress defence (32); (iii) metal detoxification (11). The latter class includes a small-size metallothionein (TmelMT) that was functionally validated in <span class="blue">yeast</span>, and phytochelatin synthase (TmelPCS), the first enzyme of this kind to be described in filamentous ascomycetes. Recombinant TmelPCS was shown to support GSH-dependent, metal-activated phytochelatin synthesis in vitro and to afford increased Cd/Cu tolerance to metal hypersensitive <span class="blue">yeast</span> strains. Metal transporters, especially those related to Cu and Zn trafficking, displayed the highest expression levels in mycorrhizae, suggesting extensive translocation of both metals to root cells as well as to <span class="yellow">fungal</span> metalloenzymes (e.g., laccase) that are strongly upregulated in symbiotic hyphae. 
<h3>21097633</h3>Genome annotation and intraviral interactome for the <span class="yellow">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> virulent phage Dp-1. <br><br><span class="yellow">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> causes several diseases, including pneumonia, septicemia, and meningitis. Phage Dp-1 is one of the very few isolated virulent <span class="yellow">S. pneumoniae</span> bacteriophages, but only a partial characterization is currently available. Here, we confirmed that Dp-1 belongs to the family Siphoviridae. Then, we determined its complete genomic sequence of 56,506 bp. It encodes 72 open reading frames, of which 44 have been assigned a function. We have identified putative promoters, Rho-independent terminators, and several genomic clusters. We provide evidence that Dp-1 may be using a novel DNA replication system as well as redirecting host protein synthesis through queuosine-containing tRNAs. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of purified phage Dp-1 particles identified at least eight structural proteins. Finally, using comprehensive <span class="red">yeast</span> two-hybrid screens, we identified 156 phage protein interactions, and this intraviral interactome was used to propose a structural model of Dp-1. 
<h3>21111055</h3>Mating differentiation in <span class="yellow">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> is negatively regulated by the Crk1 protein kinase. <br><br><span class="yellow">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> is a heterothallic basidiomycete that grows vegetatively as <span class="blue">yeast</span> and filamentous hyphae are produced in the sexual state. Previous studies have shown that <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span> Cwc1 and Cwc2 are two central photoregulators which form a complex to inhibit the production of sexual filaments upon light treatment. To reveal the detailed regulatory mechanisms, a genome wide mutagenesis screen was conducted and components in the Cwc1/Cwc2 complex mediated pathway have been identified. In this study, one suppressor mutant, DJ22, is characterized and T-DNA is found to disrupt the <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span> CRK1 gene, a homologue of <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> IME2 and <span class="yellow">Ustilago maydis</span> crk1. Ime2 is a meiosis-specific gene with the conserved Ser/Thr kinase domain and TXY dual phosphorylation site. Consistent with the findings of other suppressors in our screen, <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span> Crk1 plays a negative role in the mating process. Dikaryotic filaments, basidia, and basidiospores are produced earlier in the crk1 mutant crosses and mating efficiency is also increased. Artificial elevation of the CRK1 mRNA level inhibits mating. Interestingly, monokaryotic fruiting is defective both in the MATalpha crk1 mutant and CRK1 overexpression strains. Our studies demonstrate that <span class="yellow">C. neoformans</span> CRK1 gene functions as a negative regulator in the mating differentiation. 
<h3>21272794</h3>Emerging opportunistic <span class="red">yeast</span> infections.<br><br>A growing population of immunosuppressed patients has resulted in increasingly frequent diagnoses of invasive <span class="yellow">fungal</span> infections, including those caused by unusual <span class="yellow">yeasts</span>. The incidence of non-albicans species of Candida is increasing compared with that of <span class="yellow">Candida albicans</span>, and several species, such as <span class="yellow">Candida glabrata</span> and <span class="yellow">Candida krusei</span>, may be resistant to azole antifungal therapy. Trichosporon species are the second most common cause of fungaemia in patients with haematological malignant disease and are characterised by resistance to amphotericin and echinocandins and poor prognosis. Rhodotorula species belong to the family Cryptococcaceae, and are a cause of catheter-related fungaemia, sepsis, and invasive disease in severely immunosuppressed patients. An increasing number of sporadic cases of invasive <span class="yellow">fungal</span> infections by non-neoformans cryptococci have been reported in immunocompromised hosts, especially for patients with advanced <span class="yellow">HIV</span> infection or cancer who are undergoing transplant. Other uncommon <span class="yellow">yeasts</span> that can cause invasive disease in severely immunosuppressed patients include Geotrichum, Hansenula, Malassezia, and Saccharomyces. Host immune status is a crucial determinant of the type of invasive <span class="yellow">fungal</span> infection a patient is at risk for. Diagnosis can be challenging and relies heavily on traditional cultures of blood and other sterile sites, although serum (1,3)-Beta-D-glucan testing might have an adjunctive role. Although rare <span class="yellow">yeasts</span> are emerging as opportunistic <span class="yellow">human</span> pathogens, diagnosis remains challenging and treatment suboptimal. 
<h3>21281727</h3>Identification and characterization of putative osmosensors, HwSho1A and HwSho1B, from the extremely halotolerant <span class="yellow">black</span> <span class="red">yeast</span> <span class="yellow">Hortaea werneckii</span>. <br><br>In <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, the Sho1 protein is one of two potential osmosensors that can activate the kinase cascade of the HOG pathway in response to increased extracellular osmolarity. Two novel SHO1-like genes, HwSHO1A and HwSHO1B, have been cloned from the saltern-inhabiting, extremely halotolerant <span class="yellow">black</span> <span class="red">yeast</span> <span class="yellow">Hortaea werneckii</span>. The HwSho1 protein isoforms are 93.8% identical in their amino-acid sequences, and have a conserved SH3 domain. When the HwSHO1 genes were transferred into <span class="yellow">S. cerevisae</span> cells lacking the SHO1 gene, both of the HwSho1 isoforms fully complemented the function of the native <span class="yellow">S. cerevisiae</span> Sho1 protein. Through microscopic and biochemical validation, we demonstrate that in <span class="yellow">S. cerevisiae</span>, both of the HwSho1 proteins have characteristic subcellular localizations similar to the <span class="yellow">S. cerevisiae</span> Sho1 protein, and they can both activate the HOG pathway under conditions of osmotic stress. To a lower extent, crosstalk to the mating pathway expressing HwSho1 proteins is conserved in the PBS2 deleted <span class="yellow">S. cerevisiae</span> strain. These data show that the HwSho1 proteins from <span class="yellow">H. werneckii</span> are true functional homologs of the Sho1 protein of <span class="yellow">S. cerevisiae</span>. 
<h3>21396477</h3><span class="yellow">Agrobacterium tumefasciens</span>-mediated transformation of the aquatic fungus <span class="yellow">Blastocladiella emersonii</span>. <br><br><span class="yellow">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span> is widely used for plant DNA transformation and more recently, has also been used to transform <span class="blue">yeast</span>, filamentous fungi and even <span class="yellow">human</span> cells. Using this technique, we developed the first transformation protocol for the saprobic aquatic fungus <span class="yellow">Blastocladiella emersonii</span>, a Blastocladiomycete localized at the base of <span class="yellow">fungal</span> phylogenetic tree, which has been shown as a promising and interesting model of study of cellular function and differentiation. We constructed binary T-DNA vectors containing hygromycin phosphotransferase (hph) or enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) genes, under the control of <span class="yellow">Aspergillus nidulans</span> trpC promoter and terminator sequences. 24 h of co-cultivation in induction medium (IM) agar plates, followed by transfer to PYG-agar plates containing cefotaxim to kill <span class="yellow">Agrobacterium tumefsciens</span> and hygromycin to select transformants, resulted in growth and sporulation of resistant transformants. Genomic DNA from the pool o resistant zoospores were shown to contain T-DNA insertion as evidenced by PCR amplification of hph gene. Using a similar protocol we could also evidence the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in zoospores derived from transformed cells. This protocol can also open new perspectives for other non-transformable closely related fungi, like the Chytridiomycete class. 
<h3>21784165</h3>Functions of the mitotic B-type cyclins CLB1, CLB2, and CLB3 at mitotic exit antagonized by the CDC14 phosphatase. <br><br>In the budding <span class="blue">yeast</span> <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, cell cycle progression and cytokinesis at mitotic exit are proposed to be linked by CDC14 phosphatase antagonizing the function of mitotic B-type cyclin (CLBs). We have isolated a temperature-sensitive mutant, cdc14(A280V), with a mutation in the conserved phosphatase domain. Prolonged arrest in the cdc14(A280V) mutant partially uncoupled cell cycle progression from the completion of cytokinesis as measured by bud re-emergence, in the form of elongated apical projections, and DNA re-replication. In contrast to previous mitotic exit mutants, cdc14(A280V) mutants displayed a strong bias for the first apical projection to form in the mother cell body. Using cdc14(A280V) mutant phenotypes, the functions of the B-type cyclins at mitotic exit were investigated. The preference in mother-daughter apical projection formation was observed to be independent of any individual CLB function. However, cdc14(A280V)clb1Delta cells displayed a pronounced increase in apical projections, while cdc14(A280V)clb3Delta cells were observed to form round cellular chains. While cdc14(A280V) cells arrested at mitotic exit, both cdc14(A280V)clb1Delta and cdc14(A280V)clb3Delta cells completed cytokinesis, but failed cell separation. cdc14(A280V)clb2Delta cells displayed a defect in actin ring assembly. These observations differentiate the functions of CLB1, CLB2, and CLB3 at mitotic exit, and are consistent with the hypothesis that CLB activities are antagonized by the CDC14 phosphatase in order to couple cell cycle progression with cytokinesis at mitotic exit. 
<h3>21807108</h3>Fluorescent protein fusions in <span class="yellow">Candida guilliermondii</span>. <br><br><span class="yellow">Candida guilliermondii</span> is an emerging <span class="yellow">fungal</span> agent of candidiasis often associated with oncology patients. This <span class="blue">yeast</span> also remains a promising biotechnological model for the industrial production of value-added metabolites. In the present study, we developed a recipient strain as well as a set of plasmids for construction of fluorescent protein (FP) fusions in this species. We demonstrated that <span class="yellow">C. guilliermondii</span> phosphoglycerate kinase transcription-regulating sequences allow a constitutive expression of codon-optimized green, cyan, yellow and mCherry FP genes in <span class="yellow">C. guilliermondii</span> cells and the fluorescence signal could be directly observed at the colony and blastospore level by epifluorescence microcopy. To illustrate differential targeting of the FPs into specified cellular compartments, we studied and validated the expected subcellular localization of various <span class="yellow">C. guilliermondii</span> predicted proteins fused to FPs. Furthermore, co-expression experiments of various couples of FP-tagged <span class="yellow">C. guilliermondii</span> predicted proteins in the same cell showed that the fluorescence of each FP could be detected independently, providing firm evidences that YFP/CFP and GFP/mCherry pairs can be used for dual labeling in <span class="yellow">C. guilliermondii</span> cells. This technical advance will facilitate future studies of protein co-expression and co-localization in <span class="yellow">C. guilliermondii</span> and will give precious help for elucidating new molecular events supporting pathogenicity, antifungal resistance and for exploring the potential of <span class="blue">yeast</span> metabolic engineering. 
<h3>21820070</h3>Application of the systematic "DAmP" approach to create a partially defective <span class="yellow">C. albicans</span> mutant. <br><br>An understanding of gene function often relies upon creating multiple kinds of alleles. Functional analysis in <span class="yellow">Candida albicans</span>, a major <span class="yellow">fungal</span> pathogen, has generally included characterization of mutant strains with insertion or deletion alleles and over-expression alleles. Here we use in <span class="yellow">C. albicans</span> another type of allele that has been employed effectively in the model <span class="blue">yeast</span> <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, a "Decreased Abundance by mRNA Perturbation" (DAmP) allele (Yan et al., 2008). DAmP alleles are created systematically through replacement of 30 noncoding regions with nonfunctional heterologous sequences, and thus are broadly applicable. We used a DAmP allele to probe the function of Sun41, a surface protein with roles in cell wall integrity, cell-cell adherence, hyphal formation, and biofilm formation that has been suggested as a possible therapeutic target (Firon et al., 2007; Hiller et al., 2007; Norice et al., 2007). <span class="yellow">A</span> SUN41-DAmP allele results in approximately 10-fold reduced levels of SUN41 RNA, and yields intermediate phenotypes in most assays. We report that a sun41Delta/Delta mutant is defective in biofilm formation in vivo, and that the SUN41-DAmP allele complements that defect. This finding argues that Sun41 may not be an ideal therapeutic target for biofilm inhibition, since a 90% decrease in activity has little effect on biofilm formation in vivo. We anticipate that DAmP alleles of <span class="yellow">C. albicans</span> genes will be informative for analysis of other prospective drug targets, including essential genes. 
<h3>21945996</h3>Differential PbP27 expression in the <span class="red">yeast</span> and mycelial forms of the <span class="yellow">Paracoccidioides brasiliensis</span> species complex. <br><br>p27 is an antigenic protein produced by <span class="yellow">Paracoccidioides brasiliensis</span>, the etiologic agent of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM). Despite its unknown function, it has been suggested as a putative virulence factor, proposed as a suitable target for the design of diagnostic tools and vaccines, and considered as an enhancer in antifungal treatment of PCM. We evaluated sequence polymorphisms of PbP27 gene sequence among isolates, finding some polymorphisms associated with the isolates' phylogenetic origin. In order to determine if there was a differential expression pattern between morphological states and among isolates, we also evaluated PbP27 expression, at transcriptional and translational levels, in mycelia and <span class="red">yeast</span> cultures in 14 isolates belonging to the <span class="yellow">P. brasiliensis species complex</span> (S1, PS2, PS3, and "Pb01-like", proposed to be named <span class="yellow">Paracoccidioides lutzii</span>) by two techniques, real time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) and protein dot blot. For the latter, four protein extracts from different cell localizations (SDS or Beta-mercaptoethanol, cytoplasmic and extracellular proteins) were analyzed for each isolate. p27 was present in the four extracts evaluated, mainly in the SDS extract, corresponding to an extract containing proteins loosely attached to the cell wall. This information correlates with immunohistochemical analysis, where positive staining of the yeasts' cell wall was observed. We found that p27 was present in all isolates, mainly in the <span class="red">yeast</span> form. This pattern was corroborated by RT-qPCR results, with higher expression levels found in the <span class="red">yeast</span> form for most of the isolates. The results provide new insights into the expression patterns of this protein, and further characterize it in view of potential uses as a diagnostic and/or therapeutic tool. 
<h3>22056521</h3>Accumulation of P-bodies in <span class="yellow">Candida albicans</span> under different stress and filamentous growth conditions. <br><br><span class="yellow">Candida albicans</span> is an opportunistic <span class="yellow">fungal</span> pathogen that grows as budding <span class="red">yeast</span>, pseudohyphal, and hyphal forms. In response to external signals, <span class="yellow">C. albicans</span> switches rapidly among these forms. mRNA-containing cytoplasmic granules, termed processing bodies (P-bodies), have been reported to accumulate under various environmental stress conditions in diverse species from <span class="blue">yeast</span> to mammals. Here, we provide the first microscopic and genetic characterization of P-bodies in <span class="yellow">C. albicans</span>. The core components of P-bodies, including the decapping machinery (Dcp2 and Dhh1), 5'-3' exoribonuclease (Kem1/Xrn1), and the P-body scaffolding protein (Edc3), were identified and their localizations with respect to P-bodies were demonstrated. Various growth conditions, including glucose deprivation, hyperosmotic stress, and heat stress, stimulated the accumulation of P-bodies. In addition, we observed P-body aggregation during hyphal development. The deletion mutant strain edc3/edc3 had a defect in filamentation and exhibited a dramatic reduction in the number of P-bodies. These results suggest that Edc3 plays an essential role in the assembly and maintenance of P-bodies in <span class="yellow">C. albicans</span>, and that the switch to filamentous growth appears to accompany P-body accumulation. 
<h3>20173005</h3><span class="yellow">Thiomonas islandica</span> sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic, hydrogen- and sulfur-oxidizing <span class="yellow">betaproteobacterium</span> isolated from a hot spring. <br><br>A novel, hydrogen- and sulfur-oxidizing bacterium, designated strain <span class="yellow">6C(T)</span>, was isolated from a hot spring in Graendalur, south-western Iceland. Cells of this organism were Gram-reaction-negative, rod-shaped and motile. The strain grew aerobically and was capable of chemolithotrophic growth on thiosulfate and hydrogen, heterotrophic growth on pyruvate, oxalate, acetate and on glutamate in the presence of <span class="red">yeast</span> extract and mixotrophic growth on several organic compounds, thiosulfate and/or hydrogen. During growth on thiosulfate, the final product was sulfate, resulting in a drop in pH from 6.8 to 2.7. Heterotrophic growth on pyruvate was observed at pH 4-7 (optimum pH 4) and 35-50 ^0C (optimum 45 ^0C). The DNA G+C content was 65.2 mol%. As determined by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain <span class="yellow">6C(T)</span> represents a distinct species belonging to the class <span class="yellow">Betaproteobacteria</span> and is most closely related to <span class="yellow">Thiomonas intermedia</span> <span class="yellow">DSM 18155(T)</span> and <span class="yellow">Thiomonas perometabolis</span> <span class="yellow">DSM 18570(T)</span>. DNA-DNA hybridization between strain <span class="yellow">6C(T)</span> and <span class="yellow">Thiomonas intermedia</span> <span class="yellow">DSM 18155(T)</span> and <span class="yellow">Thiomonas perometabolis</span> <span class="yellow">DSM 18570(T)</span> gave relatedness values below 32 %. These results, together with physiological characteristics, showed that strain <span class="yellow">6C(T)</span> represents a novel species within the genus Thiomonas, for which the name <span class="yellow">Thiomonas islandica</span> sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is <span class="yellow">6C(T)</span> (=<span class="yellow">DSM 21436(T)</span> =<span class="yellow">JCM 16107(T)</span>). 
<h3>21600998</h3>The cell cycle gene MoCDC15 regulates hyphal growth, asexual development and plant infection in the <span class="yellow">rice blast pathogen</span> <span class="yellow">Magnaporthe oryzae</span>. <br><br>Rice blast, caused by the pathogen <span class="yellow">Magnaporthe oryzae</span>, is a serious hindrance to <span class="yellow">rice</span> production and has emerged as an important model for the characterization of molecular mechanisms relevant to pathogenic development in plants. Similar to other pathogenic fungi, conidiation plays a central role in initiation of <span class="yellow">M.oryzae</span> infection and spread over a large area. However, relatively little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms that underlie conidiation in <span class="yellow">M. oryzae</span>. To better characterize these mechanisms, we identified a conidiation-defective mutant, <span class="yellow">ATMT0225B6</span> (<span class="yellow">MoCDC15(T-DNA)</span>), in which a T-DNA insertion disrupted a gene that encodes a homolog of fission <span class="blue">yeast</span> cdc15, and generated a second strain containing a disruption in the same allele (DeltaMoCDC15(T-DNA)). The cdc15 gene has been shown to act as a coordinator of the cell cycle in <span class="blue">yeast</span>. Functional analysis of the <span class="yellow">MoCDC15(T-DNA)</span> and DeltaMoCDC15(T-DNA) mutants revealed that MoCDC15 is required for conidiation, preinfection development and pathogenicity in <span class="yellow">M. oryzae</span>. Conidia from these mutants were viable, but failed to adhere to hydrophobic surface, a crucial step required for subsequent pathogenic development. All phenotypic defects observed in mutants were rescued in a strain complemented with <span class="yellow">wild type MoCDC15</span>. Together, these data indicate that MoCDC15 functions as a coordinator of several biological processes important for pathogenic development in <span class="yellow">M. oryzae</span>. 
<h3>21839848</h3>The small GTPase BcCdc42 affects nuclear division, germination and virulence of the gray mold fungus <span class="yellow">Botrytis cinerea</span>. <br><br>The small GTPase Cdc42 plays a central role in various processes in eukaryotic cells including growth, differentiation and cytoskeleton organization. Whereas it is essential in the <span class="blue">yeast</span> <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, its role in filamentous fungi differs, due to the complementing, partly overlapping function of Rac. We analyzed the role of the Cdc42 homologue in the necrotrophic, broad host range pathogen <span class="yellow">Botrytis cinerea</span>. Deletion mutants of bccdc42 showed various growth abnormalities; the mutants had reduced growth rate and hyphal branching, they produced fewer conidia, which were enlarged and misshapen and had germination defects. Additionally, the mutants were impaired in sclerotia development. Cytological studies indicate that at least part of this phenotype could be attributed to disturbed control of nuclear division: conidia and hyphae of the mutant showed twofold higher nucleus/cytoplasm ratio compared to wild type cells. Apart from these effects on vegetative growth and differentiation, Deltabccdc42 strains were attenuated in penetration and colonization of host tissue, confirming that BcCdc42 - though being not essential like in <span class="blue">yeast</span> - is involved in important developmental processes in <span class="yellow">B. cinerea</span>.
