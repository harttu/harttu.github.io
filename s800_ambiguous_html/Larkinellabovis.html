<h2>Larkinella bovis</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20139284</h3><span class="blue">Larkinella bovis</span> sp. nov., isolated from fermented bovine products, and emended descriptions of the genus Larkinella and of <span class="yellow">Larkinella insperata</span> Vancanneyt et al. 2006. 

A novel bacterial strain, designated <span class="yellow">M2T2B15</span>(T), was isolated from fermented bovine products and was characterized by using a polyphasic approach. Colonies were reddish pink and circular with entire margins. Cells were strictly aerobic, Gram-reaction-negative, oxidase- and catalase-positive rods that lacked flagella and were motile by gliding. Flexirubin-type pigments were absent. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that strain <span class="yellow">M2T2B15</span>(T) was related most closely to <span class="yellow">Larkinella insperata</span> LMG 22510(T) (94.4 % similarity) but shared &lt;87 % similarity with other members of the phylum Bacteroidetes. The major cellular fatty acids were C(16 : 1)omega5c, iso-C(15 : 0) and iso-C(17 : 0) 3-OH. The polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, two unidentified aminophospholipids and two unidentified polar lipids. Menaquinone 7 (MK-7) was the major respiratory quinone. The G+C content of the DNA of strain <span class="yellow">M2T2B15</span>(T) was 52&amp;emsp14;mol%. The phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic data presented clearly indicate that strain <span class="yellow">M2T2B15</span>(T) represents a novel species of the genus Larkinella, for which the name <span class="blue">Larkinella bovis</span> sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is <span class="yellow">M2T2B15</span>(T) (=KACC 14040(T) =NBRC 106324(T)). Emended descriptions of the genus Larkinella and of <span class="yellow">Larkinella insperata</span> Vancanneyt et al. 2006 are also proposed.
