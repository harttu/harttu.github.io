<h2>VV</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20943971</h3>Roles of <span class="yellow">vaccinia virus</span> genes E3L and K3L and host genes PKR and RNase L during intratracheal infection of C57BL/6 <span class="yellow">mice</span>. <br><br>The importance of the 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/RNase L and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR) pathways in host interferon induction resulting from <span class="yellow">virus</span> infection in response to dsRNA has been well documented. In poxvirus infections, the interactions between the <span class="yellow">vaccinia virus</span> (<span class="blue">VV</span>) genes E3L and K3L, which target RNase L and PKR, respectively, serve to prevent the induction of the dsRNA-dependent induced interferon response in cell culture. To determine the importance of these host genes in controlling <span class="blue">VV</span> infections, <span class="yellow">mouse</span> single-gene knockouts of RNase L and PKR and double-knockout <span class="yellow">mice</span> were studied following intratracheal infection with <span class="blue">VV</span>, <span class="blue">VV</span>DeltaK3L, or VVDeltaE3L. <span class="red">VV</span> caused lethal disease in all <span class="yellow">mouse</span> strains. The single-knockout animals were more susceptible than wild-type animals, while the RNase L(-/-) PKR(-/-) <span class="yellow">mice</span> were the most susceptible. VVDeltaE3L infections of wild-type <span class="yellow">mice</span> were asymptomatic, demonstrating that E3L plays a critical role in controlling the host immune response. RNase L(-/-) <span class="yellow">mice</span> showed no disease, whereas 20% of the PKR(-/-) <span class="yellow">mice</span> succumbed at a dose of 10(8) PFU. Lethal disease was routinely observed in RNase L(-/-) PKR(-/-) <span class="yellow">mice</span> inoculated with 10(8) PFU of VVDeltaE3L, with a distinct pathology. VVDeltaK3L infections exhibited no differences in virulence among any of the <span class="yellow">mouse</span> constructs, suggesting that PKR is not the exclusive target of K3L. Surprisingly, VVDeltaK3L did not disseminate to other tissues from the lung. Hence, the cause of death in this model is respiratory disease. These results also suggest that an unanticipated role of the K3L gene is to facilitate <span class="yellow">virus</span> dissemination. 
<h3>20980497</h3>A <span class="yellow">vaccinia virus</span> deletion mutant reveals the presence of additional inhibitors of NF-kappaB. <br><br>The classical nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway is an important regulator of inflammation and innate immunity that is activated by a wide variety of stimuli, including <span class="yellow">virus</span> infection, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin 1Beta (IL-1Beta). Poxviruses, including <span class="yellow">vaccinia virus</span> (<span class="blue">VV</span>) and <span class="yellow">ectromelia virus</span>, encode multiple proteins that function in immune evasion. Recently, a growing number of genes encoded by poxviruses have been shown to target and disrupt the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. To determine if additional gene products that interfere with NF-kappaB signaling existed, we used a <span class="yellow">vaccinia virus</span> deletion mutant, VV811, which is missing 55 open reading frames lacking all known inhibitors of TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation. Immunofluorescence analysis of HeLa cells treated with TNF-alpha and IL-1Beta revealed that NF-kappaB translocation to the nucleus was inhibited in VV811-infected cells. This was further confirmed through Western blotting of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts for NF-kappaB. Additionally, VV811 infection inhibited TNF-alpha-induced IkappaBalpha degradation. In contrast to <span class="yellow">vaccinia virus strain Copenhagen</span> (<span class="yellow">VVCop</span>)-infected cells, VV811 infection resulted in the dramatic accumulation of phosphorylated IkappaBalpha. Correspondingly, coimmunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that the NF-kappaB-inhibitory IkappaBalpha-p65-p50 complex was intact in VV811-infected cells. Significantly, cells treated with 1-Beta-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine, an inhibitor of poxvirus late gene expression, demonstrated that an additional <span class="yellow">vaccinia virus</span> late gene was involved in the stabilization of IkappaBalpha. Overall, this work indicates that unidentified inhibitors of NF-kappaB exist in <span class="yellow">vaccinia virus</span>. The complex inhibition of NF-kappaB by <span class="yellow">vaccinia virus</span> illustrates the importance of NF-kappaB activation in the antiviral response.
