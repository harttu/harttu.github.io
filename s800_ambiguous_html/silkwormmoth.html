<h2>silkworm moth</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21793956</h3>Identification and expression analysis of nervous wreck, which is preferentially expressed in the brain of the male <span class="match annotated ">silkworm moth</span>, <span class="annotated ">Bombyx mori</span>. <br><br>Sexually dimorphic neural circuits are essential for reproductive behaviour. The molecular basis of sexual dimorphism in the <span class="match annotated ">silkworm moth</span> (<span class="annotated ">Bombyx mori</span>) brain, however, is unclear. We conducted cDNA subtraction screening and identified nervous wreck (Bmnwk), a synaptic growth regulatory gene, whose expression is higher in the male brain than in the female brain of the <span class="annotated ">silkworm</span>. Bmnwk was preferentially expressed in the brain at the late pupae and adult stages. In situ hybridization revealed that Bmnwk is highly expressed in the optic lobe of the male <span class="linneaus_only ">moth</span> brain. These findings suggest that Bmnwk has a role in the development and/or maintenance of the optic lobe in the male <span class="annotated ">silkworm</span> brain.
