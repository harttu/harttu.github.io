Hytrosaviridae is a proposed <span class="yellow">virus</span> family encompassing viruses that cause salivary gland hypertrophy (SGH) syndrome in infected insects and reduce the fertility in their dipteran insect hosts. They contain a large, double stranded DNA genome of 120-190 kbp. To date, these viruses have been detected only in adult Diptera. These include hytrosaviruses detected in various tsetse fly species (Glossina spp.), the <span class="blue">narcissus bulb fly</span> <span class="yellow">Merodon equestris</span> and the <span class="yellow">house fly</span> <span class="yellow">Musca domestica</span>. The limited number of hytrosaviruses reported to date may be a reflection of the frequent absence of external symptoms in infected adult flies and the fact that the <span class="yellow">virus</span> does not cause rapid mortality. Based on the complete genome sequence of <span class="yellow">Glossinia pallidipes</span> (GpSGHV) and <span class="yellow">Musca domestica</span> (MdSGHV) salivary gland hypertrophy viruses, a PCR based methodology was developed to detect the viruses in these species. To be able to detect hytrosaviruses in other Diptera, five degenerate primer pairs were designed and tested on GpSGHV and MdSGHV DNA using gradient PCR with annealing temperatures from 37 to 61^0C. Two pairs of primers were selected from p74, two pairs from PIF-1 and one pair from ODV-e66 homologous proteins. Four primer pairs generated a <span class="yellow">virus</span> specific PCR product on both MdSGHV and GpSGHV at all tested annealing temperatures, while the ODV-e66 based primers did not generate a <span class="yellow">virus</span> specific product with annealing temperatures higher that 47^0C. No non-specific PCR product was found when using genomic DNA of infected flies as template DNA. These results offer new sets of primers that could be used to detect hytrosaviruses in other insects.
