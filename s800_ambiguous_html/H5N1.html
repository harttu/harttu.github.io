<h2>H5N1</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20962087</h3>The magnitude of local immunity in the lungs of <span class="yellow">mice</span> induced by live attenuated <span class="yellow">influenza</span> vaccines is determined by local <span class="yellow">viral</span> replication and induction of cytokines. 

While live attenuated <span class="yellow">influenza</span> vaccines (LAIVs) have been shown to be efficacious and have been licensed for <span class="yellow">human</span> use, the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) have to be updated for optimal protective efficacy. Little is known about the effect of different HA and NA proteins on the immunogenicity of LAIVs developed using the same backbone. <span class="yellow">A</span> panel of LAIVs that share the internal protein genes, with unique HA and NA gene segments from different <span class="yellow">influenza</span> subtypes, was rescued by reverse genetics, and a comparative study of immune responses induced by these vaccines was conducted in <span class="yellow">mice</span>. The results suggest that the magnitude of lung immunity, including pulmonary IgA antibody and memory CD8(+) T lymphocytes, induced by the vaccines depends on the replication efficiency of the LAIVs, as well as the induction of cytokines/chemokines in the lungs. However, these factors are not important in determining systemic immunity such as serum antibody titers and memory CD8(+) T cells in the spleen. <span class="yellow">A</span> qualitative analysis of immune responses induced by a single dose of an <span class="blue">H5N1</span> LAIV revealed that the vaccine induced robust systemic and mucosal immunity in <span class="yellow">mice</span>. In addition, antibodies and memory lymphocytes established in the lungs following vaccination were required for protection against lethal challenge with homologous and heterologous <span class="yellow">H5N1 viruses</span>. Our results highlight the different requirements for inducing systemic and lung immunity that can be explored for the development of pulmonary immunity for protection against respiratory pathogens. 
<h3>21269678</h3>Emerging infectious diseases in southeast Asia: regional challenges to control.

Southeast Asia is a hotspot for emerging infectious diseases, including those with pandemic potential. Emerging infectious diseases have exacted heavy public health and economic tolls. Severe acute respiratory syndrome rapidly decimated the region's tourist industry. Influenza <span class="yellow">A</span> <span class="red">H5N1</span> has had a profound effect on the <span class="yellow">poultry</span> industry. The reasons why southeast Asia is at risk from emerging infectious diseases are complex. The region is home to dynamic systems in which biological, social, ecological, and technological processes interconnect in ways that enable microbes to exploit new ecological niches. These processes include population growth and movement, urbanisation, changes in food production, agriculture and land use, water and sanitation, and the effect of health systems through generation of drug resistance. Southeast Asia is home to about 600 million people residing in countries as diverse as Singapore, a city state with a gross domestic product (GDP) of US$37,500 per head, and Laos, until recently an overwhelmingly rural economy, with a GDP of US$890 per head. The regional challenges in control of emerging infectious diseases are formidable and range from influencing the factors that drive disease emergence, to making surveillance systems fit for purpose, and ensuring that regional governance mechanisms work effectively to improve control interventions. 
<h3>21047957</h3>Modification of nonstructural protein 1 of <span class="yellow">influenza A virus</span> by SUMO1.

Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is one of the major factors resulting in the efficient infection rate and high level of virulence of <span class="yellow">influenza A virus</span>. Although consisting of only approximately 230 amino acids, NS1 has the ability to interfere with several systems of the host <span class="yellow">viral</span> defense. In the present study, we demonstrate that NS1 of the highly pathogenic avian <span class="yellow">influenza</span> <span class="yellow">A/Duck/Hubei/L-1/2004 (H5N1) virus</span> interacts with <span class="yellow">human</span> Ubc9, which is the E2 conjugating enzyme for sumoylation, and we show that SUMO1 is conjugated to <span class="blue">H5N1</span> NS1 in both transfected and infected cells. Furthermore, two lysine residues in the C terminus of NS1 were identified as SUMO1 acceptor sites. When the SUMO1 acceptor sites were removed by mutation, NS1 underwent rapid degradation. Studies of different <span class="yellow">influenza A virus</span> strains of <span class="yellow">human</span> and avian origin showed that the majority of viruses possess an NS1 protein that is modified by SUMO1, except for the recently emerged <span class="yellow">swine-origin influenza A virus (S-OIV) (H1N1)</span>. Interestingly, growth of a sumoylation-deficient WSN <span class="yellow">virus</span> mutant was retarded compared to that of wild-type <span class="yellow">virus</span>. Together, these results indicate that sumoylation enhances NS1 stability and thus promotes rapid growth of <span class="yellow">influenza A virus</span>.
