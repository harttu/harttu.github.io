<h2>Umbonium costatum</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20173002</h3><span class="annotated ">Litoreibacter albidus</span> gen. nov., sp. nov. and <span class="annotated ">Litoreibacter janthinus</span> sp. nov., members of the class Alphaproteobacteria isolated from the seashore. <br><br>Two Gram-negative, strictly aerobic, non-motile bacteria designated strains <span class="annotated ">KMM 3851</span>(T) and <span class="annotated ">KMM 3842</span>(T) were respectively isolated from a marine snail specimen (<span class="match annotated ">Umbonium costatum</span>) and from surrounding sediments collected simultaneously from the shore of the Sea of Japan. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strains <span class="annotated ">KMM 3851</span>(T) and <span class="annotated ">KMM 3842</span>(T) were affiliated with the Roseobacter lineage of the class Alphaproteobacteria as a separate phylogenetic line adjacent to the members of the genus Thalassobacter. These novel isolates shared 98.5 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity and 15 % DNA-DNA relatedness. The major isoprenoid quinone of both strains was Q-10 and polar lipids consisted of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and aminophospholipids. In addition, strain <span class="annotated ">KMM 3851</span>(T) contained two unknown lipids, whereas strain <span class="annotated ">KMM 3842</span>(T) contained diphosphatidylglycerol. Fatty acid analysis revealed C(18 : 1)omega7c and C(16 : 0) as major components and small amounts of C(18 : 2). The DNA G+C contents were 60.4 mol% (<span class="annotated ">KMM 3851</span>(T)) and 58.5 mol% (<span class="annotated ">KMM 3842</span>(T)). Based on distinctive phenotypic characteristics, DNA-DNA hybridization data and phylogenetic distance, strains <span class="annotated ">KMM 3851</span>(T) and <span class="annotated ">KMM 3842</span>(T) should be classified as representatives of two novel species in a new genus, Litoreibacter gen. nov., with the type species <span class="annotated ">Litoreibacter albidus</span> sp. nov. (type strain <span class="annotated ">KMM 3851</span>(T) =NRIC 0773(T) =JCM 16493(T)) and a second species <span class="annotated ">Litoreibacter janthinus</span> sp. nov. (type strain <span class="annotated ">KMM 3842</span>(T) =NRIC 0772(T) =JCM 16492(T)).
