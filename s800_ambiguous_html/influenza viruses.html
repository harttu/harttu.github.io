</br>
We found that priming with <b>influenza viruses</b> of both SB__H1 and H3 homo - and heterosubtypes protected against lethal CA / E3 / 09 virus challenge . 
</br>
Our results highlight the importance of establishing cross - reactive T - cell responses for protecting against existing or newly emerging pandemic <b>influenza viruses</b> . 
</br>
In adults , viruses are the putative causative agents in a third of cases of community - acquired pneumonia , in particular <b>influenza viruses</b> , rhinoviruses , and coronaviruses . 
</br>
Apart from neuraminidase inhibitors for pneumonia caused by <b>influenza viruses</b> , there is no clear role for use of specific antivirals to treat viral community - acquired pneumonia .
