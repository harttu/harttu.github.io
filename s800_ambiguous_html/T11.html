<h2>T-11</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20173008</h3><span class="annotated ">Anoxybacillus tengchongensis</span> sp. nov. and <span class="annotated ">Anoxybacillus eryuanensis</span> sp. nov., facultatively anaerobic, alkalitolerant bacteria from hot springs. <br><br>Two novel thermophilic, spore-forming bacterial strains, <span class="match annotated ">T-11</span>(T) and <span class="annotated ">E-112</span>(T), were isolated from hot springs in Tengchong and Eryuan counties of Yunnan province in south-west China. The strains were Gram-stain-positive rods, occurring singly or in chains. Growth of strain <span class="match annotated ">T-11</span>(T) was observed between 30 and 75 ^0C (optimum 50 ^0C) and at pH 7-11 (optimum pH 8.5), while the temperature range for strain <span class="annotated ">E-112</span>(T) was 35-70 ^0C (optimum 55 ^0C) and the pH range was 7.0-11.0 (optimum pH 8.0). The DNA G+C contents of strains <span class="match annotated ">T-11</span>(T) and <span class="annotated ">E-112</span>(T) were 41.1 and 42.6 mol%, respectively. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, the two strains were shown to be related most closely to Anoxybacillus species. The chemotaxonomic characteristics [predominant isoprenoid quinone menaquinone 7 (MK-7); major fatty acids iso-C(15 : 0) and iso-C(17 : 0)] also supported the affiliation of strains <span class="match annotated ">T-11</span>(T) and <span class="annotated ">E-112</span>(T) to the genus Anoxybacillus. The results of DNA-DNA hybridization and physiological and biochemical tests allowed genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of strains <span class="match annotated ">T-11</span>(T) and <span class="annotated ">E-112</span>(T) from Anoxybacillus species with validly published names. Strains <span class="match annotated ">T-11</span>(T) and <span class="annotated ">E-112</span>(T) therefore represent two novel species, for which the names <span class="annotated ">Anoxybacillus tengchongensis</span> sp. nov. (type strain <span class="match annotated ">T-11</span>(T) =CCTCC AB209237(T) =KCTC 13721(T)) and <span class="annotated ">Anoxybacillus eryuanensis</span> sp. nov. (type strain <span class="annotated ">E-112</span>(T) =CCTCC AB209236(T) =KCTC 13720(T)) are proposed.
