<h2>severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20980507</h3>Successful vaccination strategies that protect aged <span class="yellow">mice</span> from lethal challenge from <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span> and heterologous <span class="blue">severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus</span>. 

Newly emerging viruses often circulate as a heterogeneous swarm in wild animal reservoirs prior to their emergence in <span class="yellow">humans</span>, and their antigenic identities are often unknown until an outbreak situation. The newly emerging <span class="blue">severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus</span> (<span class="yellow">SARS-CoV</span>) and reemerging <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span> cause disproportionate disease in the aged, who are also notoriously difficult to successfully vaccinate, likely due to immunosenescence. To protect against future emerging strains, vaccine platforms should induce broad cross-reactive immunity that is sufficient to protect from homologous and heterologous challenge in all ages. From initial studies, we hypothesized that attenuated <span class="yellow">Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus</span> (<span class="yellow">VEE</span>) replicon particle (VRP) vaccine glycoproteins mediated vaccine failure in the aged. We then compared the efficacies of vaccines bearing attenuated (VRP(3014)) or wild-type <span class="yellow">VEE</span> glycoproteins (VRP(3000)) in young and aged <span class="yellow">mice</span> within novel models of severe <span class="yellow">SARS-CoV</span> pathogenesis. Aged animals receiving VRP(3000)-based vaccines were protected from <span class="yellow">SARS-CoV</span> disease, while animals receiving the VRP(3014)-based vaccines were not. The superior protection for the aged observed with VRP(3000)-based vaccines was confirmed in a lethal <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span> challenge model. While the VRP(3000) vaccine's immune responses in the aged were sufficient to protect against lethal homologous and heterologous challenge, our data suggest that innate defects within the VRP(3014) platform mediate vaccine failure. Exploration into the mechanism(s) of successful vaccination in the immunosenescent should aid in the development of successful vaccine strategies for other <span class="yellow">viral</span> diseases disproportionately affecting the elderly, like <span class="yellow">West Nile virus</span>, <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span>, norovirus, or other emerging viruses of the future. 
<h3>21047955</h3>Alphacoronavirus <span class="yellow">transmissible gastroenteritis virus</span> nsp1 protein suppresses protein translation in mammalian cells and in cell-free HeLa cell extracts but not in <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> reticulocyte lysate. 

The nsp1 protein of <span class="yellow">transmissible gastroenteritis virus</span> (<span class="yellow">TGEV</span>), an alphacoronavirus, efficiently suppressed protein synthesis in mammalian cells. Unlike the nsp1 protein of <span class="blue">severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus</span>, a betacoronavirus, the <span class="yellow">TGEV</span> nsp1 protein was unable to bind 40S ribosomal subunits or promote host mRNA degradation. <span class="yellow">TGEV</span> nsp1 also suppressed protein translation in cell-free HeLa cell extract; however, it did not affect translation in <span class="yellow">rabbit</span> reticulocyte lysate (RRL). Our data suggested that HeLa cell extracts and cultured host cells, but not RRL, contain a host factor(s) that is essential for <span class="yellow">TGEV</span> nsp1-induced translational suppression.
