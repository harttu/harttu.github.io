<h2>Plutella xylostella</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>21029103</h3>Phylloplane location of glucosinolates in Barbarea spp. (Brassicaceae) and misleading assessment of host suitability by a specialist herbivore. <br><br>Glucosinolates are plant secondary metabolites used in host plant recognition by insects specialized on Brassicaceae, such as the <span class="annotated ">diamondback moth</span> (<span class="annotated ">DBM</span>), <span class="match annotated ">Plutella xylostella</span>. Their perception as oviposition cues by females would seem to require their occurrence on the leaf surface, yet previous studies have reached opposite conclusions about whether glucosinolates are actually present on the surface of crucifer leaves. <span class="annotated ">DBM</span> oviposits extensively on <span class="annotated ">Barbarea vulgaris</span>, despite its larvae not being able to survive on this plant because of its content of feeding-deterrent saponins. Glucosinolates and saponins in plant tissue and mechanically removed surface waxes from leaves of Barbarea spp. were analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Surface waxes from leaves of Barbarea spp. contained glucosinolates, but not feeding-deterrent saponins. Our research is the first to show that glucosinolates are present on the leaf surface of Barbarea spp., but not in other crucifers investigated, resolving some conflicting results from previous studies. Our research is also the first to quantify glucosinolates on the leaf surface of a crucifer, and to show that the concentrations of glucosinolates found on the leaf surface of Barbarea spp. are sufficient to be perceived by ovipositing <span class="annotated ">DBM</span>. 
<h3>21699595</h3>Host translational control of a polydnavirus, <span class="annotated ">Cotesia plutellae bracovirus</span>, by sequestering host eIF4A to prevent formation of a translation initiation complex. <br><br>Host translational control is a <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> strategy to exploit host cellular resources. Parasitization by some endoparasitoids containing polydnaviruses inhibits the synthesis of specific host proteins at post-transcriptional level. Two host translation inhibitory factors (HTIFs) have been proposed in <span class="annotated ">Cotesia plutellae bracovirus</span> (<span class="annotated ">CpBV</span>). Parasitization by <span class="annotated ">C. plutellae</span> inhibited storage protein 1 (SP1) synthesis of <span class="match annotated ">Plutella xylostella</span> at post-transcriptional level. One HTIF, CpBV15Beta, inhibited the translation of SP1 mRNA in an in vitro translation assay using <span class="annotated ">rabbit</span> reticulocyte lysate, but did not inhibit its own mRNA. To further analyse the discrimination of target and nontarget mRNAs of the inhibitory effect of HTIF, 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) of SP1 and CpBV15Beta mRNA were reciprocally exchanged. In the presence of HTIFs, the chimeric CpBV15Beta mRNA that contained SP1 5' UTR was not translated, whereas the chimeric SP1 mRNA that contained CpBV15Beta 5' UTR was translated. There was a difference in the 5' UTR secondary structures between target (SP1) and nontarget (CpBV15alpha and CpBV15Beta) mRNAs in terms of thermal stability. Different mutant 5' UTRs of SP1 mRNA were prepared by point mutations to modify their secondary structures. The constructs containing 5' UTRs of high thermal stability in their secondary structures were inhibited by HTIF, but those of low thermal stability were not. Immunoprecipitation with CpBV15Beta antibody coprecipitated eIF4A, which would be required for unwinding the secondary structure of the 5' UTR. These results indicate that the <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> HTIF discriminates between host mRNAs according to their dependency on eIF4A to form a functional initiation complex for translation.
