<h2>Serratia symbiotica</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21382108</h3>Responses of the <span class="yellow">pea aphid</span> transcriptome to infection by facultative symbionts.

<span class="blue">Serratia symbiotica</span> is a facultative symbiont of <span class="yellow">pea aphids</span> (<span class="yellow">Acyrthosiphon pisum</span>) that provides tolerance to heat stress. Although the phenotypic effects of facultative symbionts upon hosts have been studied in some detail, little is known about the molecular and genomic basis of these interactions. Previous studies show a large impact of <span class="yellow">S. symbiotica</span> upon the aphid metabolome. Whole-genome transcriptional profiling and next-generation sequencing demonstrated expression of 94% of RefSeq genes from the <span class="yellow">pea aphid</span> genome, providing the largest dataset to date on aphid gene expression. However, only 28 genes showed changes in expression with <span class="yellow">S. symbiotica</span> infection, and these changes were of small magnitude. No expression differences in genes involved in innate immunity in other insects were observed. Therefore, the large metabolic impact of <span class="yellow">S. symbiotica</span> is most likely a result of metabolism of the symbiont itself, or of post-transcriptional modification of host gene expression. Although <span class="yellow">S. symbiotica</span> has a major influence on its host's metabolome and resistance to heat, it induces little change in gene expression in its host.
