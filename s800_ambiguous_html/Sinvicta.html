<h2>S. invicta</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21526930</h3>Fire ant decapitating <span class="linneaus_only ">fly</span> cooperative release programs (1994-2008): two Pseudacteon species, <span class="annotated ">P. tricuspis</span> and <span class="annotated ">P. curvatus</span>, rapidly expand across imported <span class="unannotated ">fire ant</span> populations in the southeastern United States. <br><br>Natural enemies of the imported <span class="unannotated ">fire ants</span>, <span class="annotated ">Solenopsis invicta Buren</span> <span class="annotated ">S. richteri Forel</span> (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), and their hybrid, include a suite of more than 20 <span class="unannotated ">fire ant</span> decapitating phorid <span class="linneaus_only ">flies</span> from South America in the genus Pseudacteon. Over the past 12 years, many researchers and associates have cooperated in introducing several species as classical or self-sustaining biological control agents in the United States. As a result, two species of <span class="linneaus_only ">flies</span>, <span class="annotated ">Pseudacteon tricuspis Borgmeier</span> and <span class="annotated ">P. curvatus Borgmeier</span> (Diptera: Phoridae), are well established across large areas of the southeastern United States. Whereas many researchers have published local and state information about the establishment and spread of these <span class="linneaus_only ">flies</span>, here distribution data from both published and unpublished sources has been compiled for the entire United States with the goal of presenting confirmed and probable distributions as of the fall of 2008. Documented rates of expansion were also used to predict the distribution of these <span class="linneaus_only ">flies</span> three years later in the fall of 2011. In the fall of 2008, eleven years after the first successful release, we estimate that <span class="annotated ">P. tricuspis</span> covered about 50% of the <span class="unannotated ">fire ant</span> quarantined area and that it will occur in almost 65% of the quarantine area by 2011. Complete coverage of the <span class="unannotated ">fire ant</span> quarantined area will be delayed or limited by this species' slow rate of spread and frequent failure to establish in more northerly portions of the <span class="unannotated ">fire ant</span> range and also, perhaps, by its preference for <span class="annotated ">red imported fire ants</span> (<span class="match annotated ">S. invicta</span>). Eight years after the first successful release of <span class="annotated ">P. curvatus</span>, two biotypes of this species (one biotype occurring predominantly in the <span class="annotated ">black</span> and hybrid imported <span class="unannotated ">fire ants</span> and the other occurring in <span class="annotated ">red imported fire ants</span>) covered almost 60% of the <span class="unannotated ">fire ant</span> quarantined area. We estimate these two biotypes will cover almost 90% of the quarantine area by 2011 and 100% by 2012 or 2013. Strategic selection of several distributional gaps for future releases will accelerate complete coverage of quarantine areas. However, some gaps may be best used for the release of additional species of decapitating <span class="linneaus_only ">flies</span> because establishment rates may be higher in areas without competing species. 
<h3>21526927</h3>Wolbachia <span class="annotated ">wSinvictaA</span> infections in natural populations of the <span class="annotated ">fire ant</span> <span class="annotated ">Solenopsis invicta</span>: testing for phenotypic effects. <br><br>Wolbachia are intracellular bacteria that commonly infect many arthropods and some nematodes. In arthropods, these maternally transmitted bacteria often induce a variety of phenotypic effects to enhance their own spread within host populations. Wolbachia phenotypic effects generally either provide benefits to infected host females (cytoplasmic incompatibility, positive fitness effects) or bias host sex ratio in favor of females (male-killing, parthenogenesis, feminization), all of which increase the relative production of infected females in host populations. Wolbachia surveys have found infections to be exceedingly common in ants, but little is known at this juncture as to what phenotypic effects, if any, they induce in this group. Previous studies have demonstrated that individuals from native populations of the invasive <span class="annotated ">fire ant</span> <span class="annotated ">Solenopsis invicta</span> commonly harbor one or more of three Wolbachia variants. One of the variants, <span class="unannotated ">wSinvictaA</span>, typically occurs at low prevalence in <span class="match annotated ">S. invicta</span> populations, appears to have been transmitted horizontally into <span class="match annotated ">S. invicta</span> three or more times, and has been lost repeatedly from host lineages over time. In order to determine the phenotypic effects and likely population dynamics of <span class="annotated ">wSinvictaA</span> infections in these ants, brood production patterns of newly mated <span class="annotated ">fire ant</span> queens were studied during simulated claustral founding and measured <span class="annotated ">wSinvictaA</span> transmission fidelity within mature single-queen families. No clear evidence was found for Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility, significant fitness effects, or male-killing. Maternal transmission was perfect to both virgin queens and males. Possible mechanisms for how this variant could be maintained in host populations are discussed.
