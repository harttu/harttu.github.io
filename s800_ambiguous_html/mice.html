</br>
In vivo characterization of two SB__H1N1 vaccine candidates generated using the ty / 04 att backbone demonstrated that this vaccine is highly attenuated in <b>mice</b> , as indicated by the absence of signs of disease , limited replication , and minimum histopathological alterations in the respiratory tract . 
</br>
A single immunization with the ty / 04 att - based vaccines conferred complete protection against a lethal H1N1pdm virus infection in <b>mice</b> . 
</br>
Here , we systematically explore the Toll - like receptor ( TLR ) signaling requirements for the generation of cellular immune responses by intramuscular immunization with common and alternative serotype rAd vectors in <b>mice</b> . 
</br>
Antigen - specific CD8 ( + ) T - lymphocyte responses elicited by these rAd vectors were significantly diminished in MyD88 ( - / - ) <b>mice</b> but not in TRIF ( - / - ) or TLR3 ( - / - ) <b>mice</b> , suggesting the importance of MyD88 - dependent TLR signaling . 
</br>
Moreover , responses were not diminished in IL - 1R ( - / - ) or IL - 18R ( - / - ) <b>mice</b> . 
</br>
To explore the protection mechanisms in vivo , we primed <b>mice</b> with SB__H1 and SB__H3 SI__influenza SI__virus isolates and rechallenged them with a virus derived from the SB__2009 SI__H1N1 SI__A SI__/ SI__CA SI__/ SI__04 SI__/ SI__09 SI__virus , named CA / E3 / 09 . 
</br>
Convalescent - phase sera from these primed <b>mice</b> conferred no neutralization activity in vitro and no protection in vivo . 
</br>
They were separated by SDS - PAGE and electroeluted before immunization of Swiss <b>mice</b> for monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) production . 
</br>
SB__VZV infection of SB__human dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) xenografts in immunodeficient <b>mice</b> models the infection of sensory ganglia . 
</br>
In this study , the mechanism of excystation of the rodent parasites SB__Eimeria SI__nieschulzi , from rats , and SB__Eimeria SI__falciformis , from <b>mice</b> , was investigated .

</br>
The activity patterns , foraging behaviour , and space use of SB__white SI__- SI__footed SI__mice have implications for population growth rates of community members upon which <b>mice</b> incidentally prey ( i . e . gypsy moths and native thrushes ) , as well as potentially determining host - vector encounter rates and SB__human risk of LD . 
</br>
Immunochallenged <b>mice</b> had reduced wheel - running activity early in the night when measured in the lab . 
</br>
However , mouse activity , as measured by track plates in natural field experiments , did not differ between <b>mice</b> exposed to the immunogen and unexposed <b>mice</b> . 
</br>
Foraging behaviour of wild <b>mice</b> in the field - assessed with giving - up densities of seed at artificial feeding stations - was affected by exposure to the immunogen . 
</br>
Whereas immunochallenge did not influence whether foraging <b>mice</b> gained information on patch quality while foraging , it led to reductions in predator avoidance during foraging , suggesting that the proportion of space used by foraging <b>mice</b> may be greater as a result of immunochallenge . 
</br>
Surrogate neutralization assays using sera from outbreaks and from immunized <b>mice</b> suggest that , as with SB__influenza SI__virus , antigenic variation maintains GII . 4 persistence in the face of SB__human population herd immunity . 
</br>
To test this hypothesis , <b>mice</b> were hyperimmunized with virus - like particles ( VLPs ) representing an early ( GII . 4 - 1987 ) and a contemporary ( GII . 4 - 2006 ) GII . 4 strain .

SB__VZV infection of SB__human dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) xenografts in immunodeficient <b>mice</b> models the infection of sensory ganglia . 
</br>
In this study , the mechanism of excystation of the rodent parasites SB__Eimeria SI__nieschulzi , from rats , and SB__Eimeria SI__falciformis , from <b>mice</b> , was investigated .
