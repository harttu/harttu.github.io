Cytomegalovirus (CMV) utilizes multiple strategies to modulate immunity and promote lifelong, persistent/latent infection, including suppressing T cell activation pathways. Here we examined the role of B7 costimulatory ligands in establishing immune detente from both the host and <span class="yellow">virus</span> perspectives. <span class="blue">Mice</span> lacking both B7.1 and B7.2 showed reduced early expansion of CMV-specific CD4 T cells, consequently allowing for enhanced levels of persistent <span class="yellow">virus</span> replication. In turn, a CMV mutant lacking expression of the m138 and m147.5 gene products, which restrict B7.1 and B7.2 expression in infected antigen-presenting cells, induced a more robust CD4 T cell response and showed decreased persistence. Together, these data reveal a requirement for B7-mediated signaling in regulating the CMV-specific CD4 T cell response and establishing host-virus equilibrium.
