<h2>H1N1 viruses</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20962084</h3>Modifications in the polymerase genes of a <span class="yellow">swine</span>-like triple-reassortant <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span> to generate live attenuated vaccines against 2009 pandemic <span class="blue">H1N1 viruses</span>. 

On 11 June 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the outbreaks caused by novel <span class="yellow">swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus</span> had reached pandemic proportions. The pandemic <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> (H1N1pdm) <span class="yellow">virus</span> is the predominant <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span> strain in the <span class="yellow">human</span> population. It has also crossed the species barriers and infected turkeys and <span class="yellow">swine</span> in several countries. Thus, the development of a vaccine that is effective in multiple animal species is urgently needed. We have previously demonstrated that the introduction of temperature-sensitive mutations into the PB2 and PB1 genes of an avian <span class="yellow">H9N2 virus</span>, combined with the insertion of a hemagglutinin (HA) tag in PB1, resulted in an attenuated (att) vaccine backbone for both <span class="yellow">chickens</span> and <span class="yellow">mice</span>. Because the new pandemic strain is a triple-reassortant (TR) <span class="yellow">virus</span>, we chose to introduce the double attenuating modifications into a <span class="yellow">swine</span>-like TR <span class="yellow">virus</span> isolate, <span class="yellow">A/turkey/OH/313053/04 (H3N2)</span> (ty/04), with the goal of producing live attenuated <span class="yellow">influenza</span> vaccines (LAIV). This genetically modified backbone had impaired polymerase activity and restricted <span class="yellow">virus</span> growth at elevated temperatures. In vivo characterization of two <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> vaccine candidates generated using the ty/04 att backbone demonstrated that this vaccine is highly attenuated in <span class="yellow">mice</span>, as indicated by the absence of signs of disease, limited replication, and minimum histopathological alterations in the respiratory tract. <span class="yellow">A</span> single immunization with the ty/04 att-based vaccines conferred complete protection against a lethal <span class="yellow">H1N1pdm</span><span class="yellow">H1N1pdm virus</span> infection in <span class="yellow">mice</span>. More importantly, vaccination of <span class="yellow">pigs</span> with a ty/04 att-H1N1 vaccine candidate resulted in sterilizing immunity upon an aggressive intratracheal challenge with the 2009 <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> pandemic <span class="yellow">virus</span>. Our studies highlight the safety of the ty/04 att vaccine platform and its potential as a master donor strain for the generation of live attenuated vaccines for <span class="yellow">humans</span> and livestock. 
<h3>20980523</h3>T cell-mediated protection against <span class="yellow">lethal 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus</span> infection in a <span class="yellow">mouse</span> model. 

Genetic mutation and reassortment of <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span> gene segments, in particular those of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), that lead to antigenic drift and shift are the major strategies for <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span> to escape preexisting immunity. The most recent example of such phenomena is the first pandemic of <span class="yellow">H1N1 influenza</span> of the 21st century, which started in 2009. Cross-reactive antibodies raised against <span class="blue">H1N1 viruses</span> circulating before 1930 show protective activity against the <span class="yellow">2009 pandemic virus</span>. Cross-reactive T-cell responses can also contribute to protection, but in vivo support of this view is lacking. To explore the protection mechanisms in vivo, we primed <span class="yellow">mice</span> with <span class="yellow">H1</span> and <span class="yellow">H3 influenza virus</span> isolates and rechallenged them with a <span class="yellow">virus</span> derived from the <span class="yellow">2009 H1N1 A/CA/04/09 virus</span>, named CA/E3/09. We found that priming with <span class="yellow">influenza viruses</span> of both <span class="yellow">H1</span> and H3 homo- and heterosubtypes protected against lethal CA/E3/09 <span class="yellow">virus</span> challenge. Convalescent-phase sera from these primed <span class="yellow">mice</span> conferred no neutralization activity in vitro and no protection in vivo. However, T-cell depletion studies suggested that both CD4 and CD8 T cells contributed to the protection. Taken together, these results indicate that cross-reactive T cells established after initial priming with distally related viruses can be a vital component for prevention of disease and control of <span class="yellow">pandemic H1N1 influenza virus</span> infection. Our results highlight the importance of establishing cross-reactive T-cell responses for protecting against existing or newly emerging pandemic <span class="yellow">influenza viruses</span>.
