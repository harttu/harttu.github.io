<h2>Prasinoderma coloniale</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20674490</h3>Prasinoderma singularis sp. nov. (Prasinophyceae, Chlorophyta), a solitary coccoid Prasinophyte from the South-East Pacific Ocean. <br><br>During the BIOSOPE cruise in the South-East Pacific Ocean in 2004, several unidentified strains of prasinophytes were isolated into culture. Of these, nine strains composed a group for which the partial 18S rRNA gene sequence was related to <span class="match annotated ">Prasinoderma coloniale</span>. The ultrastructure, morphology, division process, pigment composition, genome size and molecular genetic phylogeny of these nine strains were investigated, using <span class="annotated ">P. coloniale</span> as a reference. The 18S rRNA gene sequence of P. singularis sp. nov. shares only 96.9% of identity with that of <span class="annotated ">P. coloniale</span> and contains a conserved insertion of 567bp length not recorded in <span class="annotated ">P. coloniale</span>. When compared to <span class="annotated ">P. coloniale</span>, P. singularis sp. nov. is morphologically characterized by the absence of colonies, smaller cells with a thinner cell wall, and a second cell type with a different cell covering.
