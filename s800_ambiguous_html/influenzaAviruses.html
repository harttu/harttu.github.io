<h2>influenza A viruses</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20951165</h3>The validation of a real-time RT-PCR assay which detects <span class="yellow">influenza A</span><span class="yellow">A</span> and types simultaneously for <span class="yellow">influenza A H1N1</span> (2009) and oseltamivir-resistant (H275Y) <span class="yellow">influenza A H1N1</span><span class="yellow">A</span> <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> (2009). <br><br>Influenza <span class="yellow">A</span> <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> (2009) was declared by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as the first <span class="yellow">influenza</span> pandemic of the 21st century. Rapid detection of <span class="yellow">influenza A</span><span class="yellow">A</span> and differentiation of <span class="yellow">influenza A H1N1</span><span class="yellow">A</span> <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> (2009) and seasonal <span class="yellow">influenza A</span><span class="yellow">A</span> is beneficial. In addition the rapid detection of antiviral resistant strains of <span class="yellow">influenza A H1N1</span><span class="yellow">A</span> <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> (2009) would be useful for clinicians to allow for change to an effective treatment at a much earlier stage if resistance is found. It was the aim of this study to develop a real-time RT-PCR that can detect all <span class="blue">influenza A viruses</span> and type simultaneously for <span class="yellow">influenza A H1N1</span> (2009) and oseltamivir resistant (H275Y) <span class="yellow">influenza A H1N1</span> (2009). This multiplex assay will allow laboratories to screen respiratory samples for all types of <span class="yellow">influenza A</span>, <span class="yellow">influenza A H1N1</span> (2009) <span class="yellow">virus</span> and oseltamivir resistant (H275Y) <span class="yellow">influenza A H1N1</span> (2009) <span class="yellow">virus</span> in a rapid and cost effective format, ensuring that typing methods for seasonal and avian viruses are used on a smaller subset of samples. Since most virology laboratories already offer a molecular service for <span class="yellow">influenza A</span><span class="yellow">A</span> this assay could easily be implemented into most areas at little cost therefore increasing local access to resistance testing. 
<h3>20962098</h3>PB2 residue 158 is a pathogenic determinant of pandemic <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> and <span class="yellow">H5 influenza a viruses</span> in <span class="yellow">mice</span>. <br><br><span class="yellow">Influenza A viruses</span> are <span class="yellow">human</span> and animal pathogens that cause morbidity and mortality, which range from mild to severe. The 2009 <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> pandemic was caused by the emergence of a reassortant <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> subtype (<span class="yellow">H1N1pdm</span>) <span class="yellow">influenza A virus</span> containing gene segments that originally circulated in <span class="yellow">human</span>, avian, and <span class="yellow">swine</span> <span class="yellow">virus</span> reservoirs. The molecular determinants of replication and pathogenesis of <span class="yellow">H1N1pdm viruses</span> in <span class="yellow">humans</span> and other mammals are poorly understood. Therefore, we set out to elucidate <span class="yellow">viral</span> determinants critical to the pathogenesis of this novel reassortant using a <span class="yellow">mouse</span> model. We found that a glutamate-to-glycine substitution at residue 158 of the PB2 gene (PB2-E158G) increased the morbidity and mortality of the parental <span class="yellow">H1N1pdm virus</span>. Results from mini-genome replication assays in <span class="yellow">human</span> cells and <span class="yellow">virus</span> titration in <span class="yellow">mouse</span> tissues demonstrated that PB2-E158G is a pathogenic determinant, because it significantly increases <span class="yellow">viral</span> replication rates. The <span class="yellow">virus</span> load in PB2-E158G-infected <span class="yellow">mouse</span> lungs was 1,300-fold higher than that of the wild-type <span class="yellow">virus</span>. Our data also show that PB2-E158G had a much stronger influence on the RNA replication and pathogenesis of <span class="yellow">H1N1pdm viruses</span> than PB2-E627K, which is a known pathogenic determinant. Remarkably, PB2-E158G substitutions also altered the pathotypes of two avian <span class="yellow">H5 viruses</span> in <span class="yellow">mice</span>, indicating that this residue impacts genetically divergent <span class="blue">influenza A viruses</span> and suggesting that this region of PB2 could be a new antiviral target. Collectively, the data presented in this study demonstrate that PB2-E158G is a novel pathogenic determinant of <span class="blue">influenza A viruses</span> in the <span class="yellow">mouse</span> model. We speculate that PB2-E158G may be important in the adaptation of avian PB2 genes to other mammals, and BLAST sequence analysis identified a naturally occurring <span class="yellow">human</span> <span class="yellow">H1N1pdm</span> isolate that has this substitution. Therefore, future surveillance efforts should include scrutiny of this region of PB2 because of its potential impact on pathogenesis. 
<h3>21029748</h3>One-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR assays for detecting and subtyping <span class="yellow">pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009</span>, <span class="yellow">seasonal influenza A/H1N1</span>, and <span class="yellow">seasonal influenza A/H3N2 viruses</span>. <br><br><span class="yellow">Pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 (A/H1N1pdm) virus</span> has caused significant outbreaks worldwide. <span class="yellow">A</span> previous one-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) assay for detecting <span class="yellow">A/H1N1pdm virus</span> (H1pdm rRT-PCR assay) was improved since the former probe had a low melting temperature and low tolerance to <span class="yellow">viral</span> mutation. To help with the screening of the <span class="yellow">A/H1N1pdm virus</span>, rRT-PCR assays were also developed for detecting <span class="yellow">human</span> <span class="yellow">seasonal A/H1N1</span> (H1 rRT-PCR assay) and <span class="yellow">A/H3N2 influenza viruses</span> (H3 rRT-PCR assay). H1pdm, <span class="yellow">H1</span>, and H3 rRT-PCR assays were evaluated using in vitro-transcribed control RNA, isolated viruses, and other respiratory pathogenic viruses, and were shown to have high sensitivity, good linearity (R(2)=0.99), and high specificity. In addition, the improved H1pdm rRT-PCR assay could detect two <span class="yellow">viral strains of A/H1N1pdm</span>, namely, <span class="yellow">A/Aichi/472/2009 (H1N1)pdm</span> and <span class="yellow">A/Sakai/89/2009 (H1N1)pdm</span>, which have mutation(s) in the probe-binding region of the hemagglutinin gene, without loss of sensitivity. Using the three rRT-PCR assays developed, 90 clinical specimens collected between May and October 2009 were then tested. Of these, 26, 20, and 2 samples were identified as positive for <span class="yellow">A/H1pdm</span>, <span class="yellow">A/H3</span>, and <span class="yellow">A/H1</span>, respectively, while 42 samples were negative for <span class="blue">influenza A viruses</span>. The present results suggest that these highly sensitive and specific H1pdm, <span class="yellow">H1</span>, and H3 rRT-PCR assays are useful not only for diagnosing <span class="yellow">influenza viruses</span>, but also for the surveillance of <span class="yellow">influenza viruses</span>.
