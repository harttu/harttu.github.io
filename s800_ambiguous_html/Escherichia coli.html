Accumulation of certain nonmetabolizable sugar - phosphates ( including alpha - methyl glucoside - 6 - phosphate ) in <b>Escherichia coli</b> is growth inhibitory and elicits the glucose - phosphate stress response . 
</br>
From one of these sequences , encoding a gene of the MmgE - PrpD family , the full length coding region was shown to encode one of the crucial itaconic acid pathway enzymes cis - aconitate decarboxylase , by heterologous expression in <b>Escherichia coli</b> .
