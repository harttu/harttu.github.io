<h2>Brassica napus</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21241331</h3>Expression of a <span class="blue">Brassica napus</span> heme oxygenase confers plant tolerance to mercury toxicity. 

Plant heme oxygenases (HOs) regulate biosynthesis of phytochrome which accounts for photo-acceptance and -morphogenesis. Recent studies have demonstrated that plant HOs also regulate many other physiological processes including response to environmental stimuli. To elucidate the mechanism by which HOs regulate plant adaptation to heavy metal exposure, three novel HOs genes were isolated from <span class="yellow">rapeseed</span> (<span class="blue">Brassica napus</span>) and their expression patterns were analysed. Alignment of deduced protein sequences revealed that the three BnHOs share high identity with their corresponding orthologos (AtHO1-3) from <span class="yellow">Arabidopsis</span>. To investigate whether the BnHO regulates plant tolerance to Hg toxicity, we constructed <span class="yellow">B. napus</span> transgenic plants overexpressing BnHO-1. Under Hg stress, the transgenic plants had 1.41-1.59 folds higher biomass than the untransformants. However, overexpression of BnHO-1 resulted in less accumulation of Hg in some lines of transformants than in untransformants. The transgenic plants show lower abundance of reactive oxygen species and attenuated oxidative injury compared with the untransgenic plants. We cloned the promoter sequences of BnHO-1 from <span class="yellow">B. napus</span>. Analysis revealed that the 1119 bp fragment contains a conserved Cd responsive element (CdRE) and others responding to multiple environmental stimuli. Transient expression in <span class="yellow">tobacco</span> leaves showed differential responses to heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Pb, Hg and Cd).
