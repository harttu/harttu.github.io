<h2>Grapholita molesta</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>22182610</h3>Interactions Between Extrafloral Nectaries, Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), and Other Natural Enemies Affect Biological Control of <span class="blue">Grapholita molesta</span> (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) on <span class="yellow">Peach</span> (Rosales: Rosaceae). <br><br>Extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) are reported to benefit some plants when ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) use their secretions and fend off herbivores, but in some cases resulting competitive interactions may reduce biological control of specific herbivores. This research examined the interactions between ants and other natural enemies associated with the EFNs of <span class="yellow">peach</span> [<span class="yellow">Prunus persica (L.) Batcsh</span>] and the implications for biological control of a key pest, the <span class="yellow">oriental fruit moth</span> [<span class="yellow">Grapholita molesta (Busck)</span>]. Studies using sentinel <span class="yellow">G. molesta</span> placed on <span class="yellow">peach</span> trees ('Lovell' cultivar) with EFNs present and absent revealed that several natural enemy groups associated with the EFNs contribute to reductions in <span class="yellow">G. molesta</span> eggs, larvae, and pupae in <span class="yellow">peach</span> orchards. Ants on trees with EFNs antagonized the <span class="yellow">G. molesta</span> egg parasitoid <span class="yellow">Trichogramma minutum (Riley)</span>, but the ants were crucial in reducing <span class="yellow">G. molesta</span> in both the larval and pupal stages. Overall, individual trees with EFNs experienced higher ant and other (nonant) natural enemy densities and subsequent pest reductions, as compared with trees without EFNs. However, the implications of EFN-natural enemy-pest interactions to orchard-level biological control will likely depend on local <span class="yellow">G. molesta</span> population dynamics.
