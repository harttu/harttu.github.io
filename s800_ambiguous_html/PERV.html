</br>
A simple system for the production of high - titer MoMLV - <b>PERV</b> pseudotypes is reported ; an EGFP - expressing replication - competent molecular clone that allows direct measurement of titer was also constructed . 
</br>
In contrast , the titer of lacZ ( <b>PERV</b> - B ) from a conventional murine SB__retroviral vector ( split genome ) was found to be 1 . 2x10 ( 2 ) CFU / ml when the SB__PERV SI__- SI__B env expression vector was transfected into TELCeB6 cells , which harbor MFGnlslacZ and the gag - pol - expressing vector . 
</br>
This EGFP - expressing <b>PERV</b> - A - IRES - EGFP molecular clone was found to be stable genetically on transfection in 293 cells .
