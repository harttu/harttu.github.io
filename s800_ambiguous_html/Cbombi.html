<h2>C. bombi</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21615578</h3>Pathways to immunity: temporal dynamics of the bumblebee (<span class="yellow">Bombus terrestris</span>) immune response against a trypanosomal gut parasite. <br><br>Immune response dynamics in insects from natural host-parasite associations are poorly understood, despite accumulating evidence of ecological immune phenomena in these systems. Using a gene discovery approach, we have identified genes relating to signalling, enzymatic processes and respiration that were up-regulated in the bumblebee, <span class="yellow">Bombus terrestris</span>, during infection with the trypanosomatid parasite, <span class="yellow">Crithidia bombi</span>. In addition, we have mapped dynamic changes in the temporal expression of these genes and three candidate antimicrobial peptide (AMP) immune genes, Abaecin, Defensin and Hymenoptaecin, from 1 to 24 h after <span class="blue">C. bombi</span> infection. We show that dynamic changes in expression occur for individual genes at distinct phases of the immune response to <span class="blue">C. bombi</span> that correspond to early, intermediate and late stages of infection.
