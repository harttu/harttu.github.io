<h2>hepatitis delta viruses</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20962099</h3>Replicative and transcriptional activities of <span class="yellow">hepatitis B virus</span> in patients coinfected with <span class="yellow">hepatitis B</span> and <span class="blue">hepatitis delta viruses</span>. 

<span class="yellow">Hepatitis B virus</span> (<span class="yellow">HBV</span>) and <span class="yellow">hepatitis delta virus</span> (<span class="yellow">HDV</span>) interplay was investigated by examining liver and serum samples from 21 coinfected and 22 <span class="yellow">HBV</span>-monoinfected patients with chronic liver disease. Different real-time PCR assays were applied to evaluate intrahepatic amounts of <span class="yellow">HBV</span> DNA, covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), pregenomic RNA (pgRNA), pre-S/S RNAs, and <span class="yellow">HDV</span> RNA. Besides <span class="yellow">HBV</span> DNA and <span class="yellow">HDV</span> RNA levels, HBsAg concentrations in the sera were also determined. <span class="yellow">HDV</span>-coinfected cases showed significantly lower median levels of serum <span class="yellow">HBV</span> DNA (-5 log), intrahepatic relaxed-circular DNA (-2 log), and cccDNA (-2 log) than those of <span class="yellow">HBV</span>-monoinfected cases. Interestingly, pgRNA and pre-S/S RNA amounts were significantly lower (both -1 log) in <span class="yellow">HDV</span>-positive patients, whereas serum HBsAg concentrations were comparable between the two patient groups. Pre-S/S RNA and HBsAg amounts per cccDNA molecule were higher in <span class="yellow">HDV</span>-positive patients (3-fold and 1 log, respectively), showing that <span class="yellow">HBV</span> replication was reduced, whereas synthesis of envelope proteins was not specifically decreased. The ratios of cccDNA to intracellular total <span class="yellow">HBV</span> DNA showed a larger proportion of cccDNA molecules in <span class="yellow">HDV</span>-positive cases. For these patients, both intrahepatic and serum <span class="yellow">HDV</span> RNA amounts were associated with cccDNA but not with HBsAg or <span class="yellow">HBV</span> DNA levels. Finally, <span class="yellow">HBV</span> genomes with large deletions in the basal core promoter/precore region were detected in 5/21 <span class="yellow">HDV</span>-positive patients but in no <span class="yellow">HDV</span>-negative patients and were associated with lower viremia levels. These findings provide significant information about the interference exerted by <span class="yellow">HDV</span> on <span class="yellow">HBV</span> replication and transcription activities in the <span class="yellow">human</span> liver.
