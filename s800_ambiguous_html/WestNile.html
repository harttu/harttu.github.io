<h2>West Nile</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20974180</h3>Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) antibody-based assays to differentiate <span class="blue">West Nile</span> (WN) <span class="yellow">virus</span> from <span class="yellow">Japanese encephalitis virus</span> infections in horses: effects of <span class="yellow">WN virus</span> NS1 antibodies induced by inactivated <span class="yellow">WN</span> vaccine. 

Antibodies to non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of <span class="yellow">West Nile virus</span> (WNV) have been used to differentiate <span class="yellow">WNV</span> infection from infection by serologically cross-reactive flaviviruses, including <span class="yellow">Japanese encephalitis virus</span> (JEV), in <span class="yellow">horses</span>. However, since the inactivated <span class="red">West Nile</span> (<span class="yellow">WN</span>) vaccine has been reported to induce NS1 antibodies, there is concern about the reliability of using NS1-based assays for testing vaccinated <span class="yellow">horses</span>. Therefore, the effect of inactivated <span class="yellow">WN</span> vaccine-induced antibodies on an epitope-blocking ELISA and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) assay were investigated. Both assays are based on NS1 antibodies and were established previously to differentiate <span class="yellow">WNV</span> from <span class="yellow">JEV</span> infections in <span class="yellow">horses</span>. Groups of three <span class="yellow">horses</span> were vaccinated with two or three doses of a commercial inactivated <span class="yellow">WN</span> vaccine and NS1 antibodies were detected by a conventional ELISA after the second vaccination. Vaccine-induced NS1 antibodies were also detected by blocking ELISA and a CDC assay and affected the ability of these assays to differentiate <span class="yellow">WNV</span> from <span class="yellow">JEV</span> infections. However, the effect was less significant in the CDC assay, where use of a low serum concentration ensured effective differentiation. The more efficient detection of infection-induced antibodies over vaccine-induced antibodies by the CDC assay was potentially attributable to the different IgG isotype profiles of these antibodies.
