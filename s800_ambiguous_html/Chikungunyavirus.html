<h2>Chikungunya virus</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20962078</h3><span class="blue">Chikungunya virus</span> induces IPS-1-dependent innate immune activation and protein kinase R-independent translational shutoff. 

<span class="blue">Chikungunya virus</span> (<span class="yellow">CHIKV</span>) is an arthritogenic mosquito-transmitted alphavirus that is undergoing reemergence in areas around the Indian Ocean. Despite the current and potential danger posed by this <span class="yellow">virus</span>, we know surprisingly little about the induction and evasion of <span class="yellow">CHIKV</span>-associated antiviral immune responses. With this in mind we investigated innate immune reactions to <span class="yellow">CHIKV</span> in <span class="yellow">human</span> fibroblasts, a demonstrable in vivo target of <span class="yellow">virus</span> replication and spread. We show that <span class="yellow">CHIKV</span> infection leads to activation of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and subsequent transcription of IRF3-dependent antiviral genes, including beta interferon (IFN-Beta). IRF3 activation occurs by way of a virus-induced innate immune signaling pathway that includes the adaptor molecule interferon promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1). Despite strong transcriptional upregulation of these genes, however, translation of the corresponding proteins is not observed. We further demonstrate that translation of cellular (but not viral) genes is blocked during infection and that although <span class="yellow">CHIKV</span> is found to trigger inactivation of the translational molecule eukaryotic initiation factor subunit 2alpha by way of the double-stranded RNA sensor protein kinase R, this response is not required for the block to protein synthesis. Furthermore, overall diminution of cellular RNA synthesis is also observed in the presence of <span class="yellow">CHIKV</span> and transcription of IRF3-dependent antiviral genes appears specifically blocked late in infection. We hypothesize that the observed absence of IFN-Beta and antiviral proteins during infection results from an evasion mechanism exhibited by <span class="yellow">CHIKV</span> that is dependent on widespread shutoff of cellular protein synthesis and a targeted block to late synthesis of antiviral mRNA transcripts. 
<h3>21227500</h3>Continuing challenge of infectious diseases in India.

In India, the range and burden of infectious diseases are enormous. The administrative responsibilities of the health system are shared between the central (federal) and state governments. Control of diseases and outbreaks is the responsibility of the central Ministry of Health, which lacks a formal public health department for this purpose. Tuberculosis, malaria, filariasis, visceral leishmaniasis, leprosy, <span class="yellow">HIV</span> infection, and childhood cluster of vaccine-preventable diseases are given priority for control through centrally managed vertical programmes. Control of <span class="yellow">HIV</span> infection and leprosy, but not of tuberculosis, seems to be on track. Early success of malaria control was not sustained, and visceral leishmaniasis prevalence has increased. Inadequate containment of the vector has resulted in recurrent outbreaks of <span class="yellow">dengue</span> fever and re-emergence of <span class="blue">Chikungunya virus</span> disease and typhus fever. Other infectious diseases caused by faecally transmitted pathogens (enteric fevers, cholera, <span class="yellow">hepatitis A</span> and <span class="yellow">E viruses</span>) and zoonoses (rabies, leptospirosis, anthrax) are not in the process of being systematically controlled. Big gaps in the surveillance and response system for infectious diseases need to be addressed. Replication of the model of vertical single-disease control for all infectious diseases will not be efficient or viable. India needs to rethink and revise its health policy to broaden the agenda of disease control. <span class="yellow">A</span> comprehensive review and redesign of the health system is needed urgently to ensure equity and quality in health care. We recommend the creation of a functional public health infrastructure that is shared between central and state governments, with professional leadership and a formally trained public health cadre of personnel who manage an integrated control mechanism of diseases in districts that includes infectious and non-infectious diseases, and injuries.
