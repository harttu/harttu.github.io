</br>
Rapid detection of <b>influenza A</b> and differentiation of <b>influenza A</b> H1N1 ( 2009 ) and seasonal <b>influenza A</b> is beneficial . 
</br>
In addition the rapid detection of antiviral resistant strains of <b>influenza A</b> H1N1 ( 2009 ) would be useful for clinicians to allow for change to an effective treatment at a much earlier stage if resistance is found . 
</br>
Since most virology laboratories already offer a molecular service for <b>influenza A</b> this assay could easily be implemented into most areas at little cost therefore increasing local access to resistance testing .
