<h2>B. rhizoxinica HKI 0454</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21131495</h3>Complete genome sequence of <span class="yellow">Burkholderia rhizoxinica</span>, an Endosymbiont of <span class="yellow">Rhizopus microsporus</span>. 

<span class="yellow">Burkholderia rhizoxinica</span> is an intracellular symbiont of the phytopathogenic fungus <span class="yellow">Rhizopus microsporus</span>. The vertically transmitted endosymbiont not only delivers the antimitotic macrolide rhizoxin to its host but is also essential for vegetative spore formation of the fungus. To shed light on the genetic equipment of this model organism, we sequenced the whole genome of <span class="blue">B. rhizoxinica HKI 0454</span>, thus providing the first genomic insight into an intracellular mutualist of a <span class="yellow">fungal</span> species. The 3.75-Mb genome consists of a chromosome and two strain-specific plasmids. The primary metabolism appears to be specialized for the uptake of <span class="yellow">fungal</span> metabolites. Besides the rhizoxin biosynthesis gene cluster, there are 14 loci coding for nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembly lines, which represent novel targets for genomic mining of cryptic natural products. Furthermore, the endosymbionts are equipped with a repertoire of virulence-related factors, which can now be studied to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying bacterial-fungal interaction.
