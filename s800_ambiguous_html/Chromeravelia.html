<h2>Chromera velia</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20643581</h3>Surface and flagella morphology of the motile form of <span class="blue">Chromera velia</span> revealed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy. <br><br><span class="blue">Chromera velia</span> (Chromerida; Alveolata) is an autotrophic protist isolated from stony corals. <span class="yellow">Ch. velia</span> possesses a chloroplast thought to be most closely related to the apicoplasts of non-photosynthetic apicomplexa. Phylogenetic analyses place <span class="yellow">Ch. velia</span> as a close relative of parasitic apicomplexa and predatory colpodellids. We have used field-emission scanning electron microscopy of cells sputter-coated with gold or chromium and non-coated cells to characterise the surface ultrastructure of the motile form of <span class="yellow">Ch. velia</span>. In overall morphology the biflagellated <span class="yellow">Ch. velia</span> cells resemble the colpodellid <span class="yellow">Colpodella edax</span>, but with some notable differences. The ventral side of the flagellated <span class="yellow">Ch. velia</span> cell has two grooves extending from the anterior flagella insertion point with a ridge rising towards the anterior apex of the cell. The anterior flagellum is shorter than the posterior flagellum and possesses a distinct, small curved appendage. The insertion point of the anterior flagellum is partly enclosed by a flap extending from the cell. The posterior flagellum is approximately four times the length of the cell and possesses mastigonemes. The combination of coating techniques proved superior to the commonly used gold coating to determine fine surface ultrastructure. This new ultrastructural information for <span class="yellow">Ch. velia</span> allowed us to emend its diagnosis. 
<h3>20643580</h3>Morphology and ultrastructure of multiple life cycle stages of the photosynthetic relative of apicomplexa, <span class="blue">Chromera velia</span>. <br><br><span class="blue">Chromera velia</span> is a photosynthetic alga with a secondary plastid that represents the closest known photosynthetic relative of the apicomplexan parasites. The original description of this organism was based on brownish, immotile coccoid cells, which is the predominating stage of <span class="yellow">C. velia</span> in the culture. Here we provide a detailed light and electron microscopy description of coccoid cells of <span class="yellow">C. velia</span> and a previously undocumented bi-flagellated stage that is highly motile and moves in a characteristic zig-zag pattern. Transformation from a coccoid into a flagellate stage occurs in exponentially growing cultures, and is accelerated by exposure to light. The <span class="yellow">C. velia</span> cells contain a pseudoconoid, which is likely homologous to the corresponding structure in the apical complex of Apicomplexa, cortical alveoli subtended by subpellicular microtubules, mitochondrion with tubular cristae, a micropyle, and a distinctive chromerosome, an apparently novel type of extrusion organelle. Ultrastructural analysis of the flagellate supports its close association with colpodellids and apicomplexans and provides important insight into their evolution.
