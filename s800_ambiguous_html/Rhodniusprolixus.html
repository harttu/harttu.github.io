<h2>Rhodnius prolixus</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20958806</h3>Neuropeptide precursor gene discovery in the Chagas disease vector <span class="blue">Rhodnius prolixus</span>. <br><br>We show a straightforward workflow combining homology search in <span class="blue">Rhodnius prolixus</span> genome sequence with cloning by rapid amplification of cDNA ends and mass spectrometry. We have identified 32 genes and their transcripts that encode a number of neuropeptide precursors leading to 194 putative peptides. We validated by mass spectrometry 82 of those predicted neuropeptides in the brain of <span class="yellow">R. prolixus</span> to achieve the first comprehensive genomic, transcriptomic and neuropeptidomic analysis of an insect disease vector. Comparisons of available insect neuropeptide sequences revealed that the <span class="yellow">R. prolixus</span> genome contains most of the conserved neuropeptides in insects, many of them displaying specific features at the sequence level. Some gene families reported here are identified for the first time in the order Hemiptera, a highly biodiverse group of insects that includes many <span class="yellow">human</span>, animal and plant disease agents. 
<h3>21906194</h3>Prolixicin: a novel antimicrobial peptide isolated from <span class="blue">Rhodnius prolixus</span> with differential activity against bacteria and <span class="yellow">Trypanosoma cruzi</span>. <br><br>We identified and characterized the activity of prolixicin, a novel antimicrobial peptide (AMP) isolated from the hemipteran insect, <span class="blue">Rhodnius prolixus</span>. Sequence analysis reveals one region of prolixicin that may be related to the diptericin/attacin family of AMPs. Prolixicin is an 11-kDa peptide containing a putative 21 amino acid signal peptide, two putative phosphorylation sites and no glycosylation sites. It is produced by both adult fat body and midgut tissues in response to bacterial infection of the haemolymph or the midgut. Unlike most insect antibacterial peptides, the prolixicin gene does not seem to be regulated by NF-kappaB binding sites, but its promoter region contains several GATA sites. Recombinant prolixicin has strong activity against the Gram-negative bacterium <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span> and differential activity against several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. No significant toxicity was demonstrated against <span class="yellow">Trypanosoma cruzi</span>, the <span class="yellow">human</span> parasite transmitted by <span class="yellow">R. prolixus</span>.
