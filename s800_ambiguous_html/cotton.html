<h2>cotton</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20962092</h3>Induction of type I interferon secretion through recombinant <span class="yellow">Newcastle disease virus</span> expressing <span class="yellow">measles virus</span> hemagglutinin stimulates antibody secretion in the presence of maternal antibodies. <br><br><span class="yellow">Measles virus</span> (<span class="yellow">MV</span>) vaccine effectively protects seronegative individuals against infection. However, inhibition of vaccine-induced seroconversion by maternal antibodies after vaccination remains a problem, as it leaves infants susceptible to <span class="yellow">MV</span> infection. In <span class="red">cotton</span> rats, passive transfer of <span class="yellow">MV</span>-specific IgG mimics maternal antibodies and inhibits vaccine-induced seroconversion. Here, we report that immunization in the presence of passively transferred IgG inhibits the secretion of neutralizing antibodies but not the generation of <span class="yellow">MV</span>-specific B cells. This finding suggested that <span class="yellow">MV</span>-specific B cells require an additional stimulus to mature into antibody-secreting plasma cells. In order to provide such a stimulus, we generated a recombinant <span class="yellow">Newcastle disease virus</span> (<span class="yellow">NDV</span>) expressing the <span class="yellow">MV</span> hemagglutinin (<span class="yellow">NDV-H</span>). In contrast to <span class="yellow">MV</span>, <span class="yellow">NDV-H</span> induced high levels of type I interferon in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and in lung tissue. In <span class="red">cotton</span> rats immunized with <span class="yellow">NDV-H</span>, neutralizing antibodies were also generated in the presence of passively transferred antibodies. In the latter case, however, the level and kinetics of antibody generation were reduced. In vitro, alpha interferon stimulated the activation of <span class="yellow">MV</span>-specific B cells from <span class="yellow">MV</span>-immune spleen cells. <span class="yellow">NDV</span> infection (which induces alpha interferon) had the same effect, and stimulation could be abrogated by antibodies neutralizing alpha interferon, but not interleukin 6 (IL-6). In vivo, coapplication of UV-inactivated <span class="yellow">MV</span> with <span class="yellow">NDV</span> led to increased <span class="yellow">MV</span>-specific antibody production in the presence and absence of passively transferred antibodies. These data indicate that <span class="yellow">MV</span>-specific B cells are being generated after immunization in the presence of maternal antibodies and that the provision of alpha interferon as an additional signal leads to antibody secretion. 
<h3>21521136</h3>Host plant effects on alkaline phosphatase activity in the whiteflies, <span class="yellow">Bemisia tabaci</span> Biotype B and <span class="yellow">Trialeurodes vaporariorum</span>. <br><br><span class="yellow">Bemisia tabaci</span> (Gennadius) B-biotype and <span class="yellow">Trialeurodes vaporariorum</span> (Westwood) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) often coexist on greenhouse-grown vegetable crops in northern China. The recent spread of <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> B-biotype has largely replaced <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span>, and B-biotype now overlaps with <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span> where common hosts occur in most invaded areas. The impact of the B-biotype on the agro eco system appears to be widespread, and involves the ability to compete with and perhaps replace other phytophages like <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span>. An emerging hypothesis is that the B-biotype is physiologically superior due at least in part to an improved ability to metabolically utilize the alkaline phosphatase pathway. To test this hypothesis, alkaline phosphatase activity was studied in the B-biotype and <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span> after feeding on a number of different hosts for a range of durations, with and without host switching. Alkaline phosphatase activity in <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span> was 1.45 to 2.53-fold higher than that of the B-biotype when fed on <span class="yellow">tomato</span> for 4 and 24 h, or switched from <span class="yellow">tomato</span> to <span class="blue">cotton</span> and <span class="yellow">cabbage</span> for the same durations. However, alkaline phosphatase activity in the B-biotype was 1.40 to 3.35-fold higher than that of <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span> when the host switching time was -72 and -120 h on the same plant. Both short-term (4 h) and long-term (72 h) switching of plant hosts can significantly affect the alkaline phosphatase activity in the two species. After -120 h, feeding on <span class="yellow">tomato</span> and <span class="blue">cotton</span> alkaline phosphatase activity in the B-biotype was significantly higher than that of <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span>. It was shown that alkaline phosphatase aids the species feeding on different plant species, and that the B-biotype is physiologically superior to <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span> in utilizing the enzyme compared to <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span> over longer periods of feeding. 
<h3>22182623</h3>Interspecific Interactions Between <span class="yellow">Bemisia tabaci</span> Biotype B and <span class="yellow">Trialeurodes vaporariorum</span> (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae). <br><br><span class="yellow">Bemisia tabaci</span> (Gennadius) biotype B and <span class="yellow">Trialeurodes vaporariorum</span> (Westwood) are invasive whitefly species that often co-occur on greenhouse-grown vegetables in northern China. Although <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> biotype B has been present in China for a relatively short period of time, it has become dominant over <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span>. We studied the interspecific competitive interactions between the two species in single or mixed cultures at 24 +/- 1^0C, 40 +/- 5% RH, and L14:D10 h photoperiod. Female longevity on <span class="yellow">tomato</span> was not significantly different between species, but <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> reproduced 4.3 to 4.9 fold more progeny. The ratio of female to male progeny in both instances was greater for <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span>. When cultured on <span class="yellow">tomato</span>, <span class="blue">cotton</span>, and <span class="yellow">tobacco</span>, <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> developed 0.8, 3.3, and 4.7 d earlier in single culture, and 1.8, 3.9, and 4.3 d earlier in mixed culture. <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> displaced <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span> in four, five and six generations when the initial ratios of <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> to <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span> were 15:15, 20:10, or 10:20 on <span class="yellow">tomato</span>. Populations of <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> were 2.3 fold higher than that of <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span> on <span class="yellow">tomato</span><span class="yellow">tomato plants</span> for seven consecutive generations in single culture. <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> performed better in development, survival, fecundity, and female ratio. We conclude that <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> could displace <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span> in as short as four generations in a controlled greenhouse environment when they start at equal proportions. Warmer greenhouse conditions and an increase in total greenhouse area could be contributing factors in the recent dominance of <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span>.
