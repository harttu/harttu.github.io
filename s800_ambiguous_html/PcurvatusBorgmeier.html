<h2>P. curvatus Borgmeier</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21526930</h3>Fire ant decapitating fly cooperative release programs (1994-2008): two Pseudacteon species, <span class="yellow">P. tricuspis</span> and <span class="yellow">P. curvatus</span>, rapidly expand across imported <span class="yellow">fire ant</span> populations in the southeastern United States. 

Natural enemies of the imported <span class="yellow">fire ants</span>, <span class="yellow">Solenopsis invicta Buren</span> <span class="yellow">S. richteri Forel</span> (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), and their hybrid, include a suite of more than 20 <span class="yellow">fire ant</span> decapitating phorid flies from South America in the genus Pseudacteon. Over the past 12 years, many researchers and associates have cooperated in introducing several species as classical or self-sustaining biological control agents in the United States. As a result, two species of flies, <span class="yellow">Pseudacteon tricuspis Borgmeier</span> and <span class="blue">P. curvatus Borgmeier</span> (Diptera: Phoridae), are well established across large areas of the southeastern United States. Whereas many researchers have published local and state information about the establishment and spread of these flies, here distribution data from both published and unpublished sources has been compiled for the entire United States with the goal of presenting confirmed and probable distributions as of the fall of 2008. Documented rates of expansion were also used to predict the distribution of these flies three years later in the fall of 2011. In the fall of 2008, eleven years after the first successful release, we estimate that <span class="yellow">P. tricuspis</span> covered about 50% of the <span class="yellow">fire ant</span> quarantined area and that it will occur in almost 65% of the quarantine area by 2011. Complete coverage of the <span class="yellow">fire ant</span> quarantined area will be delayed or limited by this species' slow rate of spread and frequent failure to establish in more northerly portions of the <span class="yellow">fire ant</span> range and also, perhaps, by its preference for <span class="yellow">red imported fire ants</span> (<span class="yellow">S. invicta</span>). Eight years after the first successful release of <span class="yellow">P. curvatus</span>, two biotypes of this species (one biotype occurring predominantly in the <span class="yellow">black</span> and hybrid imported <span class="yellow">fire ants</span> and the other occurring in <span class="yellow">red imported fire ants</span>) covered almost 60% of the <span class="yellow">fire ant</span> quarantined area. We estimate these two biotypes will cover almost 90% of the quarantine area by 2011 and 100% by 2012 or 2013. Strategic selection of several distributional gaps for future releases will accelerate complete coverage of quarantine areas. However, some gaps may be best used for the release of additional species of decapitating flies because establishment rates may be higher in areas without competing species.
