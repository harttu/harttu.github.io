<h2>Riemerella anatipestifer 12/19</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20863856</h3>Expression of the C-terminal ORF2 protein of <span class="yellow">duck astrovirus</span> for application in a serological test. 

<span class="yellow">Duck astrovirus</span> (<span class="yellow">DAstV</span>) is an important pathogen causing duck <span class="yellow">viral</span> hepatitis (DVH), a highly contagious and fatal disease in young ducklings. To provide an antigen for a diagnostic serum test, the C-terminus of <span class="yellow">DAstV</span> ORF2 protein was expressed in <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span>. Four positive and 30 negative sera were used to validate the purified ORF2 protein by developing an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). No cross-reactions were found against other duck pathogens, including <span class="yellow">duck hepatitis A virus</span>, <span class="yellow">duck plague herpesvirus</span>, <span class="yellow">duck reovirus</span>, <span class="yellow">Newcastle disease virus</span>, and <span class="blue">Riemerella anatipestifer 12/19</span> (63.2%) and <span class="yellow">26/51</span> (51%) sera samples from two flocks of ducks that survived <span class="yellow">DAstV</span> infections in commercial duck farms were positive for <span class="yellow">DAstV</span> by this method, respectively. Interestingly, <span class="yellow">DAstV</span>-specific antibodies were also detected in 12 (28.6%) of 42 sera samples from a different flock without DVH, indicating a wide distribution of subclinical infections caused by <span class="yellow">DAstV</span>.
