<h2>influenza viruses</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20933017</h3>Adaptation of a Madin-Darby <span class="annotated ">canine</span> kidney cell line to suspension growth in serum-free media and comparison of its ability to produce avian <span class="unannotated ">influenza virus</span> to Vero and BHK21 cell lines. <br><br>Madin-Darby <span class="annotated ">canine</span> kidney (MDCK) cells are currently considered for <span class="unannotated ">influenza</span> vaccine manufacturing. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> drawback of these cells is their anchorage dependent growth, which greatly complicates process scale-up. In this paper a novel MDCK cell line (MDCK-SFS) is described that grows efficiently in suspension and retained high expression levels of both alpha-2,6 and alpha-2,3 sialic acid receptors, which bind preferably to <span class="unannotated ">human</span> and avian <span class="match unannotated ">influenza viruses</span>, respectively. The production of avian <span class="unannotated ">influenza virus</span> by BHK21, Vero and MDCK-SFS cell lines was compared. Although BHK21 cells consisted of two populations, one of which lacks the alpha-2,3 receptor, they supported the replication of two <span class="unannotated ">influenza</span> strains to high titres. However, BHK21 cells are generally not applicable for <span class="unannotated ">influenza</span> production since they supported the replication of six further strains poorly. MDCK-SFS cells yielded the highest infectious <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> titres and <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> genome equivalent concentration for five of the eight <span class="unannotated ">influenza</span> strains analyzed and the highest hemagglutination activity for all eight <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> strains. Taken together with their suitability for suspension growth this makes the MDCK-SFS cell line potentially useful for large scale <span class="unannotated ">influenza virus</span> production. 
<h3>20980523</h3>T cell-mediated protection against <span class="annotated ">lethal 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus</span> infection in a <span class="unannotated ">mouse</span> model. <br><br>Genetic mutation and reassortment of <span class="annotated ">influenza virus</span> gene segments, in particular those of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), that lead to antigenic drift and shift are the major strategies for <span class="annotated ">influenza virus</span> to escape preexisting immunity. The most recent example of such phenomena is the first pandemic of <span class="annotated ">H1N1 influenza</span> of the 21st century, which started in 2009. Cross-reactive antibodies raised against <span class="annotated ">H1N1 viruses</span> circulating before 1930 show protective activity against the <span class="annotated ">2009 pandemic virus</span>. Cross-reactive T-cell responses can also contribute to protection, but in vivo support of this view is lacking. To explore the protection mechanisms in vivo, we primed <span class="unannotated ">mice</span> with <span class="annotated ">H1</span> and <span class="annotated ">H3 influenza virus</span> isolates and rechallenged them with a <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> derived from the <span class="annotated ">2009 H1N1 A/CA/04/09 virus</span>, named CA/E3/09. We found that priming with <span class="match unannotated ">influenza viruses</span> of both <span class="annotated ">H1</span> and H3 homo- and heterosubtypes protected against lethal CA/E3/09 <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> challenge. Convalescent-phase sera from these primed <span class="unannotated ">mice</span> conferred no neutralization activity in vitro and no protection in vivo. However, T-cell depletion studies suggested that both CD4 and CD8 T cells contributed to the protection. Taken together, these results indicate that cross-reactive T cells established after initial priming with distally related viruses can be a vital component for prevention of disease and control of <span class="annotated ">pandemic H1N1 influenza virus</span> infection. Our results highlight the importance of establishing cross-reactive T-cell responses for protecting against existing or newly emerging pandemic <span class="match unannotated ">influenza viruses</span>. 
<h3>21435708</h3>Viral pneumonia.<br><br>About 200 million cases of <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> community-acquired pneumonia occur every year-100 million in <span class="linneaus_only ">children</span> and 100 million in adults. Molecular diagnostic tests have greatly increased our understanding of the role of viruses in pneumonia, and findings indicate that the incidence of <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> pneumonia has been underestimated. In <span class="linneaus_only ">children</span>, <span class="annotated ">respiratory syncytial virus</span>, rhinovirus, <span class="annotated ">human metapneumovirus</span>, <span class="annotated ">human bocavirus</span>, and parainfluenza viruses are the agents identified most frequently in both developed and developing countries. Dual <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> infections are common, and a third of <span class="linneaus_only ">children</span> have evidence of viral-bacterial co-infection. In adults, viruses are the putative causative agents in a third of cases of community-acquired pneumonia, in particular <span class="match unannotated ">influenza viruses</span>, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses. Bacteria continue to have a predominant role in adults with pneumonia. Presence of <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> epidemics in the community, patient's age, speed of onset of illness, symptoms, biomarkers, radiographic changes, and response to treatment can help differentiate <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> from bacterial pneumonia. However, no clinical algorithm exists that will distinguish clearly the cause of pneumonia. No clear consensus has been reached about whether <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span> with obvious <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> community-acquired pneumonia need to be treated with antibiotics. Apart from neuraminidase inhibitors for pneumonia caused by <span class="match unannotated ">influenza viruses</span>, there is no clear role for use of specific antivirals to treat <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> community-acquired pneumonia. Influenza vaccines are the only available specific preventive measures. Further studies are needed to better understand the cause and pathogenesis of community-acquired pneumonia. Furthermore, regional differences in cause of pneumonia should be investigated, in particular to obtain more data from developing countries. 
<h3>21029748</h3>One-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR assays for detecting and subtyping <span class="annotated ">pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009</span>, <span class="annotated ">seasonal influenza A/H1N1</span>, and <span class="annotated ">seasonal influenza A/H3N2 viruses</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 (A/H1N1pdm) virus</span> has caused significant outbreaks worldwide. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> previous one-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) assay for detecting <span class="annotated ">A/H1N1pdm virus</span> (H1pdm rRT-PCR assay) was improved since the former probe had a low melting temperature and low tolerance to <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> mutation. To help with the screening of the <span class="annotated ">A/H1N1pdm virus</span>, rRT-PCR assays were also developed for detecting <span class="annotated ">human</span> <span class="annotated ">seasonal A/H1N1</span> (H1 rRT-PCR assay) and <span class="annotated ">A/H3N2 influenza viruses</span> (H3 rRT-PCR assay). H1pdm, <span class="unannotated ">H1</span>, and H3 rRT-PCR assays were evaluated using in vitro-transcribed control RNA, isolated viruses, and other respiratory pathogenic viruses, and were shown to have high sensitivity, good linearity (R(2)=0.99), and high specificity. In addition, the improved H1pdm rRT-PCR assay could detect two <span class="annotated ">viral strains of A/H1N1pdm</span>, namely, <span class="annotated ">A/Aichi/472/2009 (H1N1)pdm</span> and <span class="annotated ">A/Sakai/89/2009 (H1N1)pdm</span>, which have mutation(s) in the probe-binding region of the hemagglutinin gene, without loss of sensitivity. Using the three rRT-PCR assays developed, 90 clinical specimens collected between May and October 2009 were then tested. Of these, 26, 20, and 2 samples were identified as positive for <span class="annotated ">A/H1pdm</span>, <span class="annotated ">A/H3</span>, and <span class="annotated ">A/H1</span>, respectively, while 42 samples were negative for <span class="annotated ">influenza A viruses</span>. The present results suggest that these highly sensitive and specific H1pdm, <span class="unannotated ">H1</span>, and H3 rRT-PCR assays are useful not only for diagnosing <span class="match annotated ">influenza viruses</span>, but also for the surveillance of <span class="match annotated ">influenza viruses</span>.
