<h2>mouse cytomegalovirus</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20980502</h3>Cytomegalovirus microRNA expression is tissue specific and is associated with persistence. <br><br>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs involved in posttranscriptional regulation. miRNAs are utilized in organisms ranging from plants to higher mammals, and data have shown that DNA viruses also use this method for host and <span class="yellow">viral</span> gene regulation. Here, we report the sequencing of the small RNAs in <span class="yellow">rat cytomegalovirus</span> (<span class="yellow">RCMV</span>)-infected fibroblasts and persistently infected salivary glands. We identified 24 unique miRNAs that mapped to hairpin structures found within the <span class="yellow">viral</span> genome. While most miRNAs were detected in both samples, four were detected exclusively in the infected fibroblasts and two were specific for the infected salivary glands. The <span class="yellow">RCMV</span> miRNAs are distributed across the <span class="yellow">viral</span> genome on both the positive and negative strands, with clusters of miRNAs at a number of locations, including near <span class="yellow">viral</span> genes r1 and r111. The <span class="yellow">RCMV</span> miRNAs have a genomic positional orientation similar to that of the miRNAs described for <span class="blue">mouse cytomegalovirus</span>, but they do not share any substantial sequence conservation. Similar to other reported miRNAs, the <span class="yellow">RCMV</span> miRNAs had considerable variation at their 3' and 5' ends. Interestingly, we found a number of specific examples of differential isoform usage between the fibroblast and salivary gland samples. We determined by real-time PCR that expression of the <span class="yellow">RCMV</span> miRNA miR-r111.1-2 is highly expressed in the salivary glands and that miR-R87-1 is expressed in most tissues during the acute infection phase. Our study identified the miRNAs expressed by <span class="yellow">RCMV</span> in vitro and in vivo and demonstrated that expression is tissue specific and associated with a stage of <span class="yellow">viral</span> infection.
