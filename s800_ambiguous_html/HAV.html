<h2>HAV</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20971134</h3>Applied biotechnology for production of immunoglobulin Y specific to <span class="yellow">hepatitis A virus</span>. <br><br>A new protocol for producing polyclonal antibody against <span class="yellow">hepatitis A virus</span> (<span class="blue">HAV</span>) is described. Twenty <span class="yellow">hens</span> were immunized three times with a commercial <span class="blue">HAV</span> vaccine and <span class="blue">HAV</span> from a cell culture with three types of adjuvants: CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODN), incomplete Freund's adjuvant and an alum adjuvant. In each of the last two booster inoculations, blood from the birds was collected and tested for <span class="blue">HAV</span> antibodies. Egg yolk was separated from egg white and immunoglobulin Y (IgY) antibody was then purified by polyethylene glycol 6000. The mean yield of total protein in yolk was 22.62 mg/mL. Specific activity of the antibody was tested using commercial ELISA, Western blotting, and in vitro neutralization assay demonstrating that anti-<span class="blue">HAV</span> IgY bound specifically. After the first immunization, birds immunized with <span class="blue">HAV</span> from cell culture plus incomplete Freund's adjuvant with/without CpG-ODN showed highest levels of anti-<span class="blue">HAV</span> IgY in serum (p&lt;0.05). Viral combination with CpG-ODN resulted in early response of anti-<span class="blue">HAV</span> serum in <span class="yellow">hens</span>, reflecting the amount of IgY transferred to the egg yolk (p&lt;0.05). The results suggest that egg yolk may be a large scale source of specific antibodies against <span class="yellow">hepatitis A virus</span>. Further applications of this method have yet to be tested.
