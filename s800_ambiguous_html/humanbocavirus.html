<h2>human bocavirus</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21435708</h3>Viral pneumonia.

About 200 million cases of <span class="yellow">viral</span> community-acquired pneumonia occur every year-100 million in children and 100 million in adults. Molecular diagnostic tests have greatly increased our understanding of the role of viruses in pneumonia, and findings indicate that the incidence of <span class="yellow">viral</span> pneumonia has been underestimated. In children, <span class="yellow">respiratory syncytial virus</span>, rhinovirus, <span class="yellow">human metapneumovirus</span>, <span class="blue">human bocavirus</span>, and parainfluenza viruses are the agents identified most frequently in both developed and developing countries. Dual <span class="yellow">viral</span> infections are common, and a third of children have evidence of viral-bacterial co-infection. In adults, viruses are the putative causative agents in a third of cases of community-acquired pneumonia, in particular <span class="yellow">influenza viruses</span>, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses. Bacteria continue to have a predominant role in adults with pneumonia. Presence of <span class="yellow">viral</span> epidemics in the community, patient's age, speed of onset of illness, symptoms, biomarkers, radiographic changes, and response to treatment can help differentiate <span class="yellow">viral</span> from bacterial pneumonia. However, no clinical algorithm exists that will distinguish clearly the cause of pneumonia. No clear consensus has been reached about whether patients with obvious <span class="yellow">viral</span> community-acquired pneumonia need to be treated with antibiotics. Apart from neuraminidase inhibitors for pneumonia caused by <span class="yellow">influenza viruses</span>, there is no clear role for use of specific antivirals to treat <span class="yellow">viral</span> community-acquired pneumonia. Influenza vaccines are the only available specific preventive measures. Further studies are needed to better understand the cause and pathogenesis of community-acquired pneumonia. Furthermore, regional differences in cause of pneumonia should be investigated, in particular to obtain more data from developing countries.
