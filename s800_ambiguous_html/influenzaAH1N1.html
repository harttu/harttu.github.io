<h2>influenza A H1N1</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20951165</h3>The validation of a real-time RT-PCR assay which detects <span class="yellow">influenza A</span><span class="yellow">A</span> and types simultaneously for <span class="blue">influenza A H1N1</span> (2009) and oseltamivir-resistant (H275Y) <span class="red">influenza A H1N1</span><span class="yellow">A</span> <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> (2009). 

Influenza <span class="yellow">A</span> <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> (2009) was declared by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as the first <span class="yellow">influenza</span> pandemic of the 21st century. Rapid detection of <span class="yellow">influenza A</span><span class="yellow">A</span> and differentiation of <span class="red">influenza A H1N1</span><span class="yellow">A</span> <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> (2009) and seasonal <span class="yellow">influenza A</span><span class="yellow">A</span> is beneficial. In addition the rapid detection of antiviral resistant strains of <span class="red">influenza A H1N1</span><span class="yellow">A</span> <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> (2009) would be useful for clinicians to allow for change to an effective treatment at a much earlier stage if resistance is found. It was the aim of this study to develop a real-time RT-PCR that can detect all <span class="yellow">influenza A viruses</span> and type simultaneously for <span class="blue">influenza A H1N1</span> (2009) and oseltamivir resistant (H275Y) <span class="blue">influenza A H1N1</span> (2009). This multiplex assay will allow laboratories to screen respiratory samples for all types of <span class="yellow">influenza A</span>, <span class="blue">influenza A H1N1</span> (2009) <span class="yellow">virus</span> and oseltamivir resistant (H275Y) <span class="blue">influenza A H1N1</span> (2009) <span class="yellow">virus</span> in a rapid and cost effective format, ensuring that typing methods for seasonal and avian viruses are used on a smaller subset of samples. Since most virology laboratories already offer a molecular service for <span class="yellow">influenza A</span><span class="yellow">A</span> this assay could easily be implemented into most areas at little cost therefore increasing local access to resistance testing.
