<h2>B. cereus</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21131488</h3><span class="yellow">Bacillus anthracis</span> sin locus and regulation of secreted proteases.<br><br><span class="yellow">Bacillus anthracis</span> shares many regulatory loci with the nonpathogenic Bacillus species <span class="yellow">Bacillus subtilis</span>. One such locus is sinIR, which in <span class="yellow">B. subtilis</span> controls sporulation, biofilm formation, motility, and competency. As <span class="yellow">B. anthracis</span> is not known to be motile, to be naturally competent, or to readily form biofilms, we hypothesized that the <span class="yellow">B. anthracis</span> sinIR regulon is distinct from that of <span class="yellow">B. subtilis</span>. <span class="yellow">A</span> genome-wide expression microarray analysis of <span class="yellow">B. anthracis</span> parental and sinR mutant strains indicated limited convergence of the <span class="yellow">B. anthracis</span> and <span class="yellow">B. subtilis</span> SinR regulons. The <span class="yellow">B. anthracis</span> regulon includes homologues of some <span class="yellow">B. subtilis</span> SinR-regulated genes, including the signal peptidase gene sipW near the sinIR locus and the sporulation gene spoIIE. The <span class="yellow">B. anthracis</span> SinR protein also negatively regulates transcription of genes adjacent to the sinIR locus that are unique to the <span class="yellow">Bacillus cereus group species</span>. These include calY and inhA1, structural genes for the metalloproteases camelysin and immune inhibitor A1 (InhA1), which have been suggested to be associated with virulence in <span class="blue">B. cereus</span> and <span class="yellow">B. anthracis</span>, respectively. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed direct binding of <span class="yellow">B. anthracis</span> SinR to promoter DNA from strongly regulated genes, such as calY and sipW, but not to the weakly regulated inhA1 gene. Assessment of camelysin and InhA1 levels in culture supernates from sinR-, inhA1-, and calY-null mutants showed that the concentration of InhA1 in the culture supernatant is inversely proportional to the concentration of camelysin. Our data are consistent with a model in which InhA1 protease levels are controlled at the transcriptional level by SinR and at the posttranslational level by camelysin.
