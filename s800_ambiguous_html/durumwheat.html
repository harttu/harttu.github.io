<h2>durum wheat</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21029104</h3>Improved nitrogen nutrition enhances root uptake, root-to-shoot translocation and remobilization of zinc ((65) Zn) in <span class="yellow">wheat</span>. <br><br>This study focussed on the effect of increasing nitrogen (N) supply on root uptake and root-to-shoot translocation of zinc (Zn) as well as retranslocation of foliar-applied Zn in <span class="blue">durum wheat</span> (<span class="yellow">Triticum durum</span>). Nutrient solution experiments were conducted to examine the root uptake and root-to-shoot translocation of (65) Zn in seedlings precultured with different N supplies. In additional experiments, the effect of varied N nutrition on retranslocation of foliar-applied (65) Zn was tested at both the vegetative and generative stages. When N supply was increased, the (65) Zn uptake by roots was enhanced by up to threefold and the (65) Zn translocation from roots to shoots increased by up to eightfold, while plant growth was affected to a much smaller degree. Retranslocation of (65) Zn from old into young leaves and from flag leaves to grains also showed marked positive responses to increasing N supply. The results demonstrate that the N-nutritional status of <span class="yellow">wheat</span> affects major steps in the route of Zn from the growth medium to the grain, including its uptake, xylem transport and remobilization via phloem. Thus, N is a critical player in the uptake and accumulation of Zn in plants, which deserves special attention in biofortification of food crops with Zn. 
<h3>21062317</h3>Dual Delta^1^3C/delta^1^8O response to water and nitrogen availability and its relationship with yield in field-grown <span class="blue">durum wheat</span>. <br><br>The combined use of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes in plant matter is a tool of growing interest in cereal crop management and breeding, owing to its relevance for assessing the photosynthetic and transpirative performance under different growing conditions including water and N regimes. However, this method has not been applied to <span class="yellow">wheat</span> grown under real field conditions. Here, plant growth, grain yield (GY) and the associated agronomic components, carbon isotope discrimination (Delta^1^3C) plus oxygen isotope composition (delta^1^8O) as well as leaf and canopy gas exchange were measured in field-grown <span class="yellow">wheat</span> subjected to different water and N availabilities. Water limitation was the main factor affecting yield, leaf and canopy gas exchange and Delta^1^3C and delta^1^8O, whereas N had a smaller effect on such traits. The combination of Delta^1^3C and delta^1^8O gave a clear advantage compared with gas exchange measurements, as it provides information on the instantaneous and the long-term plant photosynthetic and transpirative performance and are less labour intensive than gas exchange measurements. In addition, the combination of plant Delta^1^3C and delta^1^8O predicted differences in GY and related agronomical parameters, providing agronomists and breeders with integrative traits for selecting crop management practices and/or genotypes with better performance under water-limiting and N-limiting conditions.
