<h2>A. niger strain</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21176790</h3>Characterization of a polyketide synthase in <span class="yellow">Aspergillus niger</span> whose product is a precursor for both dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) melanin and naphtho-gamma-pyrone. <br><br>The genome sequencing of the fungus <span class="yellow">Aspergillus niger</span> uncovered a large cache of genes encoding enzymes thought to be involved in the production of secondary metabolites yet to be identified. Identification and structural characterization of many of these predicted secondary metabolites are hampered by their low concentration relative to the known <span class="yellow">A. niger</span> metabolites such as the naphtho-gamma-pyrone family of polyketides. We deleted a non-reducing PKS gene in <span class="blue">A. niger strain</span> ATCC 11414, a daughter strain of <span class="yellow">A. niger ATCC strain 1015</span> whose genome was sequenced by the DOE Joint Genome Institute. This PKS encoding gene we name albA is a predicted ortholog of alb1 from <span class="yellow">Aspergillus fumigatus</span> which is responsible for production of the naphtho-gamma-pyrone precursor for the 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) melanin/spore pigment. Our results show that the <span class="yellow">A. nigeralbA</span> PKS is responsible for both the production of the spore pigment precursor and a family of naphtho-gamma-pyrones commonly found in significant quantity in <span class="yellow">A. niger</span> culture extracts. The generation of an <span class="yellow">A. niger</span><span class="red">A. niger strain</span> devoid of naphtho-gamma-pyrones will greatly facilitate the elucidation of cryptic biosynthetic pathways in this organism.
