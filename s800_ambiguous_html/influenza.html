</br>
Madin - Darby SB__canine kidney ( MDCK ) cells are currently considered for <b>influenza</b> vaccine manufacturing . 
</br>
In this paper a novel MDCK cell line ( MDCK - SFS ) is described that grows efficiently in suspension and retained high expression levels of both alpha - 2 , 6 and alpha - 2 , 3 sialic acid receptors , which bind preferably to human and avian <b>influenza</b> viruses , respectively . 
</br>
The production of avian <b>influenza</b> virus by BHK21 , Vero and MDCK - SFS cell lines was compared . 
</br>
Although BHK21 cells consisted of two populations , one of which lacks the alpha - 2 , 3 receptor , they supported the replication of two <b>influenza</b> strains to high titres . 
</br>
However , BHK21 cells are generally not applicable for <b>influenza</b> production since they supported the replication of six further strains poorly . 
</br>
MDCK - SFS cells yielded the highest infectious virus titres and virus genome equivalent concentration for five of the eight <b>influenza</b> strains analyzed and the highest hemagglutination activity for all eight virus strains . 
</br>
Taken together with their suitability for suspension growth this makes the MDCK - SFS cell line potentially useful for large scale <b>influenza</b> virus production . 
</br>
Because the new pandemic strain is a triple - reassortant ( TR ) virus , we chose to introduce the double attenuating modifications into a SB__swine - like TR virus isolate , SB__A SI__/ SI__turkey SI__/ SI__OH SI__/ SI__313053 SI__/ SI__04 SI__( SI__H3N2 SI__) ( ty / 04 ) , with the goal of producing live attenuated <b>influenza</b> vaccines ( LAIV ) . 
</br>
The magnitude of local immunity in the lungs of SB__mice induced by live attenuated <b>influenza</b> vaccines is determined by local viral replication and induction of cytokines . 
</br>
While live attenuated <b>influenza</b> vaccines ( LAIVs ) have been shown to be efficacious and have been licensed for SB__human use , the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin ( HA ) and neuraminidase ( NA ) have to be updated for optimal protective efficacy . 
</br>
A panel of LAIVs that share the internal protein genes , with unique HA and NA gene segments from different <b>influenza</b> subtypes , was rescued by reverse genetics , and a comparative study of immune responses induced by these vaccines was conducted in SB__mice . 
</br>
Successful vaccination strategies that protect aged SB__mice from lethal challenge from <b>influenza</b> virus and heterologous SB__severe SI__acute SI__respiratory SI__syndrome SI__coronavirus . 
</br>
The newly emerging SB__severe SI__acute SI__respiratory SI__syndrome SI__coronavirus ( SB__SARS SI__- SI__CoV ) and reemerging <b>influenza</b> virus cause disproportionate disease in the aged , who are also notoriously difficult to successfully vaccinate , likely due to immunosenescence . 
</br>
The superior protection for the aged observed with VRP ( 3000 ) - based vaccines was confirmed in a lethal <b>influenza</b> virus challenge model . 
</br>
Exploration into the mechanism ( s ) of successful vaccination in the immunosenescent should aid in the development of successful vaccine strategies for other viral diseases disproportionately affecting the elderly , like SB__West SI__Nile SI__virus , <b>influenza</b> virus , norovirus , or other emerging viruses of the future . 
</br>
T - cell cross - reactivity between SB__HCV and <b>influenza</b> virus - specific epitopes has been associated with rapid progression of SB__HCV disease ( S . Urbani , B . Amadei , P . Fisicaro , M . Pilli , G . Missale , A . Bertoletti , and C . Ferrari , J . Exp . Med . 201 : 675 - 680 , 2005 ) . 
</br>
We found that priming with <b>influenza</b> viruses of both SB__H1 and H3 homo - and heterosubtypes protected against lethal CA / E3 / 09 virus challenge . 
</br>
Our results highlight the importance of establishing cross - reactive T - cell responses for protecting against existing or newly emerging pandemic <b>influenza</b> viruses .

Seasonal <b>influenza</b> epidemiology in sub - Saharan Africa : a systematic review . 
</br>
Acute respiratory infection ( ARI ) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide , of which <b>influenza</b> is an important cause that can be prevented with vaccination . 
</br>
We did a systematic review of research published from 1980 to 2009 on seasonal <b>influenza</b> epidemiology in sub - Saharan Africa to identify data strengths and weaknesses that might affect policy decisions , to assess the state of knowledge on <b>influenza</b> disease burden , and to ascertain unique features of <b>influenza</b> epidemiology in the region . 
</br>
1 - 25 % of outpatient ARI visits were caused by <b>influenza</b> ( 11 studies ; mean 9 * 5 % ; median 10 % ) , whereas 0 * 6 - 15 * 6 % of children admitted to hospital for ARI had <b>influenza</b> identified ( 15 studies ; mean 6 * 6 % ; median 6 * 3 % ) . 
</br>
Other data were often absent , particularly direct measurement of <b>influenza</b> incidence rates for all ages , within different patient settings ( outpatient , inpatient , community ) , and for all countries . 
</br>
Data from sub - Saharan Africa are insufficient to allow most countries to prioritise strategies for <b>influenza</b> prevention and control . 
</br>
Key data gaps include incidence and case - fatality ratios for all ages , the contribution of <b>influenza</b> towards admission of adults to hospital for ARI , representative seasonality data , economic burden , and the interaction of <b>influenza</b> with prevalent disorders in Africa , such as malaria , SB__HIV , and malnutrition . 
</br>
In adults , viruses are the putative causative agents in a third of cases of community - acquired pneumonia , in particular <b>influenza</b> viruses , rhinoviruses , and coronaviruses . 
</br>
Apart from neuraminidase inhibitors for pneumonia caused by <b>influenza</b> viruses , there is no clear role for use of specific antivirals to treat viral community - acquired pneumonia .

The validation of a real - time RT - PCR assay which detects <b>influenza</b> A and types simultaneously for SB__influenza SI__A SI__H1N1 ( 2009 ) and oseltamivir - resistant ( H275Y ) <b>influenza</b> A H1N1 ( 2009 ) . 
</br>
Influenza A H1N1 ( 2009 ) was declared by the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) as the first <b>influenza</b> pandemic of the 21st century . 
</br>
Rapid detection of <b>influenza</b> A and differentiation of <b>influenza</b> A H1N1 ( 2009 ) and seasonal <b>influenza</b> A is beneficial . 
</br>
In addition the rapid detection of antiviral resistant strains of <b>influenza</b> A H1N1 ( 2009 ) would be useful for clinicians to allow for change to an effective treatment at a much earlier stage if resistance is found . 
</br>
Since most virology laboratories already offer a molecular service for <b>influenza</b> A this assay could easily be implemented into most areas at little cost therefore increasing local access to resistance testing .
