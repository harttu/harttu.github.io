</br>
Although B cells may be effective in stimulating cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses , studies involving their role in <b>FV</b> infection have mainly focused on neutralizing antibody production . 
</br>
Here we show that polyclonal activation of B cells promotes their infection with <b>FV</b> both in vitro and in vivo . 
</br>
Furthermore , we demonstrate that complement opsonization of Friend SB__murine SI__leukemia SI__virus SI__( SI__F SI__- SI__MuLV SI__) enhances infection of B cells , which correlates with increased potency of B cells to activate <b>FV</b> - specific CD8 ( + ) T cells .
