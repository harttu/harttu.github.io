<h2>canine</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20933017</h3>Adaptation of a Madin-Darby <span class="blue">canine</span> kidney cell line to suspension growth in serum-free media and comparison of its ability to produce avian <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span> to Vero and BHK21 cell lines. 

Madin-Darby <span class="blue">canine</span> kidney (MDCK) cells are currently considered for <span class="yellow">influenza</span> vaccine manufacturing. <span class="yellow">A</span> drawback of these cells is their anchorage dependent growth, which greatly complicates process scale-up. In this paper a novel MDCK cell line (MDCK-SFS) is described that grows efficiently in suspension and retained high expression levels of both alpha-2,6 and alpha-2,3 sialic acid receptors, which bind preferably to <span class="yellow">human</span> and avian <span class="yellow">influenza viruses</span>, respectively. The production of avian <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span> by BHK21, Vero and MDCK-SFS cell lines was compared. Although BHK21 cells consisted of two populations, one of which lacks the alpha-2,3 receptor, they supported the replication of two <span class="yellow">influenza</span> strains to high titres. However, BHK21 cells are generally not applicable for <span class="yellow">influenza</span> production since they supported the replication of six further strains poorly. MDCK-SFS cells yielded the highest infectious <span class="yellow">virus</span> titres and <span class="yellow">virus</span> genome equivalent concentration for five of the eight <span class="yellow">influenza</span> strains analyzed and the highest hemagglutination activity for all eight <span class="yellow">virus</span> strains. Taken together with their suitability for suspension growth this makes the MDCK-SFS cell line potentially useful for large scale <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span> production.
