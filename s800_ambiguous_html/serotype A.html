In India , there has been co - circulation , extinction and emergence of genotypes / lineages within <b>serotype A</b> foot - and - mouth disease ( SB__FMD ) virus . 
</br>
To elucidate the physiological functions of the RNAi pathway in SB__Cryptococcus SI__neoformans that causes fungal meningitis , here we performed genetic analyses for genes encoding Argonaute ( AGO1 and AGO2 ) , RNA - dependent RNA polymerase ( RDP1 ) , and Dicers ( DCR1 and DCR2 ) in both <b>serotype A</b> and D SB__C SI__. SI__neoformans . 
</br>
Comparative transcriptome analysis of the <b>serotype A</b> and D RNAi mutants revealed that only modest changes occur in the genome - wide transcriptome profiles when the RNAi process was perturbed .
