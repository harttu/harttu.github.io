<h2>Mink</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20951744</h3>Implementation and validation of a sensitive PCR detection method in the eradication campaign against <span class="annotated ">Aleutian mink disease virus</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Aleutian mink disease virus (AMDV)</span> is a severe progressive disease causing multiple different clinical syndromes in <span class="annotated ">mink</span>. In Denmark, the disease is notifiable and under official control. The control programme, based on serological screening, has confined successfully <span class="annotated ">AMDV</span> to the northern part of Denmark. However, re-infections and new introductions of <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> into farms require a confirmatory virological test to verify the positive test results of single animals and ultimately to investigate disease transmission. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> one step PCR amplifying a 374-base fragment of the NS1 gene of <span class="annotated ">AMDV</span> was compared to the counter-current immune electrophoresis (CIE) routinely used in the serological screening programme. <span class="match annotated ">Mink</span> organs (n=299) obtained from 55 recently infected farms and 8 non-infected farms from 2008 to 2010 were tested by PCR, and the results were found to have a high correlation with the serological status of the <span class="annotated ">mink</span>. The relative diagnostic sensitivity of the PCR was 94.7%, and the relative diagnostic specificity was 97.9% when read in parallel with the CIE. PCR positive samples were sequenced and phylogenetic analysis revealed high similarity within the analysed <span class="annotated ">AMDV strains</span> and to <span class="annotated ">AMDV strains</span> described previously.
