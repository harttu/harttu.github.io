<h2>Abeoforma whisleri</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20708961</h3>Facing unknowns: living cultures (<span class="yellow">Pirum gemmata gen. nov., sp. nov.</span>, and <span class="yellow">Abeoforma whisleri, gen. nov., sp. nov.</span>) from invertebrate digestive tracts represent an undescribed clade within the unicellular Opisthokont lineage ichthyosporea (Mesomycetozoea). 

During a culture-based survey of opisthokonts living in marine invertebrate digestive tracts, we isolated two new eukaryotes that differed from described taxa by more than 10% in their small subunit ribosomal DNA sequences. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the two isolates represented a divergent clade of ichthyosporeans known previously only from environmental clone sequences. We used light and electron microscopy to describe the isolates as new genera and species <span class="yellow">Pirum gemmata</span> and <span class="blue">Abeoforma whisleri</span>. <span class="yellow">A. whisleri</span> had a complex life cycle that remains incompletely known but involved walled spherical cells, plasmodia and amoebae. Asexual reproduction occurred via dispersal amoebae, endospores, binary fission and budding. In contrast <span class="yellow">P. gemmata</span> had a less complex life cycle with no amoeboid or plasmodial stages. Both species had membrane-bound tubular extensions of the cytoplasm embedded in the inner layers of their cell walls. By comparing <span class="yellow">P. gemmata</span> and <span class="yellow">A. whisleri</span> to other ichthyosporea we speculate on the characters that may have been present in the ancestral ichthyosporean. <span class="yellow">P. gemmata</span> and <span class="yellow">A. whisleri</span> illustrate the unique and diverse forms that can be found by capturing taxa belonging to divergent and uncultured lineages.
