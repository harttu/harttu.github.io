<h2>Agrobacterium tumefsciens</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21396477</h3><span class="yellow">Agrobacterium tumefasciens</span>-mediated transformation of the aquatic fungus <span class="yellow">Blastocladiella emersonii</span>. <br><br><span class="yellow">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span> is widely used for plant DNA transformation and more recently, has also been used to transform <span class="yellow">yeast</span>, filamentous fungi and even <span class="yellow">human</span> cells. Using this technique, we developed the first transformation protocol for the saprobic aquatic fungus <span class="yellow">Blastocladiella emersonii</span>, a Blastocladiomycete localized at the base of <span class="yellow">fungal</span> phylogenetic tree, which has been shown as a promising and interesting model of study of cellular function and differentiation. We constructed binary T-DNA vectors containing hygromycin phosphotransferase (hph) or enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) genes, under the control of <span class="yellow">Aspergillus nidulans</span> trpC promoter and terminator sequences. 24 h of co-cultivation in induction medium (IM) agar plates, followed by transfer to PYG-agar plates containing cefotaxim to kill <span class="blue">Agrobacterium tumefsciens</span> and hygromycin to select transformants, resulted in growth and sporulation of resistant transformants. Genomic DNA from the pool o resistant zoospores were shown to contain T-DNA insertion as evidenced by PCR amplification of hph gene. Using a similar protocol we could also evidence the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in zoospores derived from transformed cells. This protocol can also open new perspectives for other non-transformable closely related fungi, like the Chytridiomycete class.
