<h2>pigs</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20923690</h3>Development of a blocking ELISA for detection of serum neutralizing antibodies against <span class="yellow">porcine circovirus type 2</span>. <br><br>A monoclonal antibody (Mab)-based blocking ELISA was developed for the detection of serum neutralizing antibodies to <span class="yellow">porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2)</span>. The Mab with neutralizing activity, which was produced by immunizing a recombinant capsid protein of PCV2 expressed in insect cells, was used as the detector antibody. The assay was evaluated in comparison with a serum neutralization assay, and its sensitivity and specificity were determined to be 98.8% and 88.5%, respectively. <span class="yellow">A</span> significant positive correlation was found between results of the blocking ELISA and the serum neutralization assay (r=0.9381). The assay was verified by testing experimental and commercial <span class="yellow">pig</span> sera. <span class="yellow">A</span> longitudinal antibody profile showed that serum neutralizing antibodies were detected 2 weeks after vaccination and that the detection rate reached 100% at 4 weeks. The serum neutralizing antibody profile showed a decrease from the age of 4 to 13 weeks, and seroconversion after 13 weeks in <span class="blue">pigs</span> from a commercial <span class="yellow">pig</span> farm. Additionally, the positive detection rate in 703 sera collected from nine commercial <span class="yellow">pig</span> farms was 73%. This report demonstrates that the assay is a simple, specific, sensitive and convenient method for epidemiological surveys and evaluations of serum neutralizing antibodies against PCV2. 
<h3>20951743</h3>Development and validation of a lateral flow immunoassay using colloidal gold for the identification of serotype-specific <span class="yellow">foot-and-mouth disease virus O</span>, <span class="yellow">A</span> and <span class="yellow">Asia 1</span>. <br><br>A lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) was developed to identify and diagnose <span class="yellow">foot-and-mouth disease virus</span> (<span class="yellow">FMDV</span>) serotypes <span class="yellow">O</span>, <span class="yellow">A</span> and <span class="yellow">Asia 1</span>. Antibodies obtained from <span class="yellow">rabbits</span> and guinea <span class="red">pigs</span> immunized with cell-culture-adapted <span class="yellow">virus</span> strains (<span class="yellow">O/CHA/99</span>, <span class="yellow">A/GS/LX/66</span>, <span class="yellow">Asia 1/CHN/05</span>) and suckling-<span class="yellow">mouse</span> adapted <span class="yellow">virus</span> strains (<span class="yellow">O/AV99(L)</span>, <span class="yellow">A/AV88(L)</span>, <span class="yellow">Asia 1/YNBS/58</span>) were used as capture antibodies. The diagnostic kit included three immunochromatographic strips of types <span class="yellow">O</span>, <span class="yellow">A</span> and <span class="yellow">Asia 1</span>, and the type-specific results were confirmed by color on the test lines of the three strips. The LFI was evaluated using epithelial and vesicular samples (n=396) prepared from current and historical field samples (provide by the National Foot-and-Mouth Disease Reference Laboratory of China at Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute). Negative samples (n=95) were collected from healthy animals. The diagnostic sensitivity of the LFI for <span class="yellow">FMDV</span> serotypes <span class="yellow">O</span>, <span class="yellow">A</span> and <span class="yellow">Asia 1</span> was 88.3% compared to 89.7% obtained by the reference method of indirect-sandwich ELISA. The sensitivity of the LFI for <span class="yellow">FMDV type Asia 1</span> was higher at 92.1% compared to 90.5% for the ELISA. The specificity of the LFI was 97.1% compared with 97.4%. 
<h3>20962084</h3>Modifications in the polymerase genes of a <span class="yellow">swine</span>-like triple-reassortant <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span> to generate live attenuated vaccines against 2009 pandemic <span class="yellow">H1N1 viruses</span>. <br><br>On 11 June 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the outbreaks caused by novel <span class="yellow">swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus</span> had reached pandemic proportions. The pandemic <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> (H1N1pdm) <span class="yellow">virus</span> is the predominant <span class="yellow">influenza virus</span> strain in the <span class="yellow">human</span> population. It has also crossed the species barriers and infected turkeys and <span class="yellow">swine</span> in several countries. Thus, the development of a vaccine that is effective in multiple animal species is urgently needed. We have previously demonstrated that the introduction of temperature-sensitive mutations into the PB2 and PB1 genes of an avian <span class="yellow">H9N2 virus</span>, combined with the insertion of a hemagglutinin (HA) tag in PB1, resulted in an attenuated (att) vaccine backbone for both <span class="yellow">chickens</span> and <span class="yellow">mice</span>. Because the new pandemic strain is a triple-reassortant (TR) <span class="yellow">virus</span>, we chose to introduce the double attenuating modifications into a <span class="yellow">swine</span>-like TR <span class="yellow">virus</span> isolate, <span class="yellow">A/turkey/OH/313053/04 (H3N2)</span> (ty/04), with the goal of producing live attenuated <span class="yellow">influenza</span> vaccines (LAIV). This genetically modified backbone had impaired polymerase activity and restricted <span class="yellow">virus</span> growth at elevated temperatures. In vivo characterization of two <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> vaccine candidates generated using the ty/04 att backbone demonstrated that this vaccine is highly attenuated in <span class="yellow">mice</span>, as indicated by the absence of signs of disease, limited replication, and minimum histopathological alterations in the respiratory tract. <span class="yellow">A</span> single immunization with the ty/04 att-based vaccines conferred complete protection against a lethal <span class="yellow">H1N1pdm</span><span class="yellow">H1N1pdm virus</span> infection in <span class="yellow">mice</span>. More importantly, vaccination of <span class="red">pigs</span> with a ty/04 att-H1N1 vaccine candidate resulted in sterilizing immunity upon an aggressive intratracheal challenge with the 2009 <span class="yellow">H1N1</span> pandemic <span class="yellow">virus</span>. Our studies highlight the safety of the ty/04 att vaccine platform and its potential as a master donor strain for the generation of live attenuated vaccines for <span class="yellow">humans</span> and livestock. 
<h3>20933542</h3>The rapid production of high-titer <span class="yellow">porcine endogenous retrovirus</span>(PERV)-B env pseudotype and construction of an EGFP-expressing replication competent <span class="yellow">PERV-A</span> vector. <br><br><span class="yellow">Porcine endogenous retroviruses</span> (<span class="yellow">PERVs</span>) present a unique concern associated with xenotransplantation because they have been shown to infect certain <span class="yellow">human</span> cells in vitro and it is also difficult to generate herds of <span class="blue">pigs</span> free of <span class="yellow">PERVs</span>. <span class="yellow">A</span> simple system for the production of high-titer MoMLV-PERV pseudotypes is reported; an EGFP-expressing replication-competent molecular clone that allows direct measurement of titer was also constructed. To improve the MLV-based <span class="yellow">retroviral</span> vector system, a 2.1-kb <span class="yellow">PERV</span><span class="yellow">PERV-B</span> env product was amplified from PK-15 genomic DNA and cloned into the pCL-Eco <span class="yellow">retroviral</span> vector. The titer of lacZ (<span class="yellow">PERV-B</span>) from the 293 cells was about 1.0x10(4) CFU/ml. In contrast, the titer of lacZ (PERV-B) from a conventional murine <span class="yellow">retroviral</span> vector (split genome) was found to be 1.2x10(2) CFU/ml when the <span class="yellow">PERV-B</span> env expression vector was transfected into TELCeB6 cells, which harbor MFGnlslacZ and the gag-pol-expressing vector. In addition, an infectious <span class="yellow">PERV-A</span> clone containing enhanced GFP (EGFP) by using a PCR-based method was developed. This EGFP-expressing PERV-A-IRES-EGFP molecular clone was found to be stable genetically on transfection in 293 cells.
