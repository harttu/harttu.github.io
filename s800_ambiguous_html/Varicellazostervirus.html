<h2>Varicella-zoster virus</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20962081</h3><span class="match annotated ">Varicella-zoster virus</span> glycoprotein E is a critical determinant of virulence in the SCID mouse-<span class="annotated ">human</span> model of neuropathogenesis. <br><br><span class="match annotated ">Varicella-zoster virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">VZV</span>) is a neurotropic alphaherpesvirus. <span class="annotated ">VZV</span> infection of <span class="annotated ">human</span> dorsal root ganglion (DRG) xenografts in immunodeficient <span class="unannotated ">mice</span> models the infection of sensory ganglia. We examined DRG infection with recombinant <span class="annotated ">VZV</span> (recombinant Oka [rOka]) and the following gE mutants: gEDelta27-90, gEDeltaCys, gE-AYRV, and gE-SSTT. gEDelta27-90, which lacks the gE domain that interacts with a putative receptor insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), replicated as extensively as rOka, producing infectious virions and significant cytopathic effects within 14 days of inoculation. Since neural cells express IDE, the gE/IDE interaction was dispensable for <span class="annotated ">VZV</span> neurotropism. In contrast, gEDeltaCys, which lacks gE/gI heterodimer formation, was significantly impaired at early times postinfection; <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> genome copy numbers increased slowly, and infectious <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> production was not detected until day 28. Delayed replication was associated with impaired cell-cell spread in ganglia, similar to the phenotype of a gI deletion mutant (rOkaDeltagI). However, at later time points, infection of satellite cells and other supportive nonneuronal cells resulted in extensive DRG tissue damage and cell loss such that cytopathic changes observed at day 70 were more severe than those for rOka-infected DRG. The replication of gE-AYRV, which is impaired for trans-Golgi network (TGN) localization, and the replication of gE-SSTT, which contains mutations in an acidic cluster, were equivalent to that of rOka, causing significant cytopathic effects and infectious <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> production by day 14; genome copy numbers were equivalent to those of rOka. These experiments suggest that the gE interaction with cellular IDE, gE targeting to TGN sites of virion envelopment, and phosphorylation at SSTT are dispensable for <span class="annotated ">VZV</span> DRG infection, whereas the gE/gI interaction is critical for <span class="unannotated ">VZV</span> neurovirulence.
