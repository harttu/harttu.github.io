<h2>Acanthamoeba castellanii</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20650684</h3>Possible roles of phospholipase A(2) in the biological activities of <span class="blue">Acanthamoeba castellanii</span> (T4 Genotype). <br><br>Using phospholipases A(2)-specific spectrophotometric assays, it was shown that <span class="yellow">A. castellanii</span> lysates and their conditioned medium exhibit phospholipase activities. The extracellular levels of PLA(2)detected were significantly reduced compared with the cell-associated enzyme (P&lt;0.05). Sphinganine, a PLA(2)inhibitor showed robust amoebistatic properties but had no effect on the viability of <span class="yellow">A. castellanii</span>. The potency of sphinganine was demonstrated effectively towards purified PLA(2)derived from porcine pancreas. Using sphinganine, it was observed that PLA(2)is involved in neither binding nor cytotoxicity of the <span class="yellow">human</span> brain microvascular endothelial cells due to <span class="yellow">A. castellanii</span>. Unlike as was the case for Dictyostelium amoebae, PLA(2) appeared to be involved in <span class="yellow">A. castellanii</span> phagocytosis of the fluorescently-labelled polystyrene beads. <span class="yellow">Horseradish</span> peroxidase was used as a tracer molecule to develop assays to study pinocytosis in <span class="yellow">A. castellanii</span>. The findings revealed that sphinganine impedes phagocytosis but augments pinocytosis in <span class="yellow">A. castellanii</span> suggesting distinct nature of processes. <span class="yellow">A</span> complete understanding of the role of phospholipases in the biology and pathogenesis of <span class="yellow">A. castellanii</span> infections will determine their potential as therapeutic targets.
