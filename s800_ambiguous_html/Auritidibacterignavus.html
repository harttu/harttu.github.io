<h2>Auritidibacter ignavus</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20190019</h3><span class="yellow">Auritidibacter ignavus gen. nov., sp. nov.</span>, of the family Micrococcaceae isolated from an ear swab of a man with otitis externa, transfer of the members of the family Yaniellaceae Li et al. 2008 to the family Micrococcaceae and emended description of the suborder Micrococcineae. <br><br>A Gram-reaction-positive, aerobic, catalase-positive, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium designated <span class="yellow">IMMIB L-1656(T)</span> was isolated from an ear swab of a man and characterized using a polyphasic approach. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that strain <span class="yellow">IMMIB L-1656(T)</span> is related to members of the family Micrococcaceae (&lt;95.1 % sequence similarity). Anaylsis using different phylogenetic algorithms consistently grouped strain <span class="yellow">IMMIB L-1656(T)</span> with members of the genus Yaniella. The organism posessed a cell-wall murein based on L-lysine (variation A4alpha, type L-Lys-Gly-L-Glu), MK-10 as the predominant menaquinone and long-chain cellular fatty acids of straight-chain and branched-chain saturated types (with iso-C(15 : 0) and anteiso-C(17 : 0) predominating). The polar lipids included diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol in addition to unknown glycolipids. The DNA G+C content was 59.7 mol%. Based on its distinctive genotypic and phenotypic characteristics, strain <span class="yellow">IMMIB L-1656(T)</span> represents a novel species in a novel genus, for which the name <span class="yellow">Auritidibacter ignavus gen. nov., sp. nov.</span> is proposed. We also propose that members of the family Yaniellaceae be transferred to the family Micrococcaceae with amendments to the description of the suborder Micrococcineae. The type strain of <span class="blue">Auritidibacter ignavus</span> is <span class="yellow">IMMIB L-1656(T)</span> (=<span class="yellow">DSM 45359(T)</span> =<span class="yellow">CCUG 57943(T)</span>).
