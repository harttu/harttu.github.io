<h2>human immunodeficiency virus type 1</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20962083</h3>Small-molecule inhibition of <span class="match annotated ">human immunodeficiency virus type 1</span> infection by <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> capsid destabilization. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Human immunodeficiency virus type 1</span> (<span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span>) infection is dependent on the proper disassembly of the <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> capsid, or &quot;uncoating,&quot; in target cells. The <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> capsid consists of a conical multimeric complex of the <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> capsid protein (CA) arranged in a hexagonal lattice. Mutations in CA that destabilize the <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> capsid result in impaired infection owing to defects in reverse transcription in target cells. We describe here the mechanism of action of a small molecule <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> inhibitor, PF-3450074 (PF74), which targets CA. PF74 acts at an early stage of <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> infection and inhibits reverse transcription in target cells. We show that PF74 binds specifically to <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> particles, and substitutions in CA that confer resistance to the compound prevent binding. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> single point mutation in CA that stabilizes the <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> core also conferred strong resistance to the <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> without inhibiting compound binding. Treatment of <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> particles or purified cores with PF74 destabilized the <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> capsid in vitro. Furthermore, the compound induced the rapid dissolution of the <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> capsid in target cells. PF74 antiviral activity was promoted by binding of the host protein cyclophilin <span class="unannotated ">A</span> to the <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> capsid, and PF74 and cyclosporine exhibited mutual antagonism. Our data suggest that PF74 triggers premature <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> uncoating in target cells, thereby mimicking the activity of the retrovirus restriction factor TRIM5alpha. This study highlights uncoating as a step in the <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> life cycle that is susceptible to small molecule intervention. 
<h3>20980495</h3>The B cell response is redundant and highly focused on V1V2 during early subtype C infection in a Zambian seroconverter. <br><br>High-titer autologous neutralizing antibody responses have been demonstrated during early subtype C <span class="match annotated ">human immunodeficiency virus type 1</span> (<span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span>) infection. However, characterization of this response against autologous <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> at the monoclonal antibody (MAb) level has only recently begun to be elucidated. Here we describe five monoclonal antibodies derived from a subtype C-infected seroconverter and their neutralizing activities against pseudoviruses that carry envelope glycoproteins from 48 days (0 month), 2 months, and 8 months after the estimated time of infection. Sequence analysis indicated that the MAbs arose from three distinct B cell clones, and their pattern of neutralization compared to that in <span class="linneaus_only ">patient</span> plasma suggested that they circulated between 2 and 8 months after infection. Neutralization by MAbs representative of each B cell clone was mapped to two residues: position 134 in V1 and position 189 in V2. Mutational analysis revealed cooperative effects between glycans and residues at these two positions, arguing that they contribute to a single epitope. Analysis of the cognate gp120 sequence through homology modeling places this potential epitope near the interface between the V1 and V2 loops. Additionally, the escape mutation R189S in V2, which conferred resistance against all three MAbs, had no detrimental effect on <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> replication in vitro. Taken together, our data demonstrate that independent B cells repeatedly targeted a single structure in V1V2 during early infection. Despite this assault, a single amino acid change was sufficient to confer complete escape with minimal impact on replication fitness. 
<h3>20980522</h3>RNA aptamers directed to <span class="match annotated ">human immunodeficiency virus type 1</span> Gag polyprotein bind to the matrix and nucleocapsid domains and inhibit <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> production. <br><br>Gag orchestrates the assembly and release of <span class="match annotated ">human immunodeficiency virus type 1</span> (<span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span>) particles. We explored here the potential of anti-Gag RNA aptamers to inhibit <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> replication. In vitro, RNA aptamers raised against an <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> Gag protein, lacking the N-terminal myristate and the C-terminal p6 (DP6-Gag), could bind to matrix protein (MA), nucleocapsid protein (NC), or entire DP6-Gag protein. Upon cotransfection with pNL4-3.Luc molecular clone into 293T cells, six of the aptamers caused mild inhibition (2- to 3-fold) in the extracellular capsid levels, and one aptamer displayed 20-fold inhibition. The reduction was not due to a release defect but reflected Gag mRNA levels. We hypothesized that the aptamers influence genomic RNA levels via perturbation of specific Gag-genomic RNA interactions. Binding studies revealed that the &quot;NC-binders&quot; specifically compete with the packaging signal (psi) of <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> for binding to DP6-Gag. Therefore, we tested the ability of two NC-binders to inhibit viruses containing psi-region deletions (DeltaSL1 or DeltaSL3) and found that the NC-binders were no longer able to inhibit Gag synthesis. The inability of these aptamers to inhibit psi-deleted viruses correlated with the absence of competition with the corresponding psi transcripts lacking SL1 or SL3 for binding DP6-Gag in vitro. These results indicate that the NC-binding aptamers disrupt Gag-genomic RNA interaction and negatively affect genomic RNA transcription, processing, or stability. Our results reveal an essential interaction between <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> Gag and the psi-region that may be distinct from that which occurs during the encapsidation of genomic RNA. Thus, anti-Gag aptamers can be an effective tool to perturb Gag-genomic RNA interactions.
