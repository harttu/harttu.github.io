<h2>Aspergillus flavus</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21277379</h3>Independent duplications of alpha-amylase in different strains of <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus oryzae</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Aspergillus oryzae</span> is a filamentous fungus that has arisen through the ancient domestication of <span class="match annotated ">Aspergillus flavus</span> for making traditional oriental foods and beverages. In the many centuries <span class="annotated ">A. oryzae</span> has been used for fermenting the starch in <span class="unannotated ">rice</span> to simple sugars, it has undergone selection for increased secretion of starch-degrading enzymes. In particular, all <span class="annotated ">A. oryzae</span> strains investigated thus far have two or more copies of a gene encoding alpha-amylase, whereas <span class="annotated ">A. flavus</span> has only one. Here we investigate the duplications leading to these copies in three <span class="annotated ">A. oryzae</span> strains. We find evidence of at least three separate duplications of alpha-amylase, an example of parallel evolution in a micro-organism under artificial selection. At least two of these duplications appear to be associated with activity of transposable elements of the Tc1/mariner class. Both involve a 9.1 kb element that terminates in inverted repeats, encodes a putative transposase and another putative protein of unknown function, and contains an unusual arrangement of four short internal imperfect repeats. Although &quot;unusual Mariners&quot; of this size have previously been identified in <span class="annotated ">A. oryzae</span>, <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus fumigatus</span> and <span class="annotated ">Aspergillus nidulans</span>, this is the first evidence we know of that at least some of them are active in modern times and that their activity can contribute to beneficial genetic changes.
