<h2>genus Beta HPV</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20980500</h3>Differential regulation of <span class="annotated ">human papillomavirus type 8</span> by interferon regulatory factors 3 and 7. <br><br>The genus <span class="annotated ">Beta human papillomavirus (HPV) type 8</span> is associated with nonmelanoma skin cancer in <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span> with epidermodysplasia verruciformis, and evidence for its protumorigenic potential in the general population increases. To date, strategies to suppress <span class="match annotated ">genus Beta HPV</span> infections are limited. Interferon regulatory factors IRF-3 and IRF-7 play key roles in the activation of the innate immune response to <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> infections. In this study, we show for the first time that both IRF-3 and IRF-7 regulate transcription of a papillomavirus, but with opposing effects. IRF-7, expressed in the suprabasal layers of <span class="annotated ">human</span> epidermis, increased <span class="annotated ">HPV8</span> late promoter activity via direct binding to <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> DNA. UV-B light-induced activation of the <span class="annotated ">HPV8</span> promoter involved IRF-7 as a downstream effector. In contrast, IRF-3, expressed in all layers of <span class="annotated ">human</span> epidermis, induced strong <span class="annotated ">HPV8</span> suppression in primary keratinocytes. IRF-3-mediated suppression prevailed over IRF-7-induced <span class="annotated ">HPV8</span> transcription. Unlike the E6 oncoprotein of the mucosal high-risk <span class="annotated ">HPV16</span>, the <span class="annotated ">HPV8</span> E6 protein did not bind to IRF-3 and only weakly antagonized its activity. Strong antiviral activity was also observed, when keratinocytes were treated with potent IRF-3 activators, poly(I:C) or RNA bearing 5' phosphates. In conclusion, we show that IRF-3 activation induces a state of cell-autonomous immunity against HPV in primary <span class="annotated ">human</span> keratinocytes. Our study suggests that local application of IRF-3-activating compounds might constitute an attractive novel therapeutic strategy against <span class="annotated ">HPV8</span>-associated diseases, particularly in epidermodysplasia verruciformis <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span>.
