<h2>Galleria mellonella</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21907298</h3><span class="blue">Galleria mellonella</span> as model host for the trans-kingdom pathogen <span class="yellow">Fusarium oxysporum</span>. <br><br><span class="yellow">Fusarium oxysporum</span>, the causal agent of vascular wilt disease, affects a wide range of plant species and can produce disseminated infections in <span class="yellow">humans</span>. <span class="yellow">F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici isolate FGSC 9935</span> causes disease both on <span class="yellow">tomato plants</span> and immunodepressed <span class="yellow">mice</span>, making it an ideal model for the comparative analysis of <span class="yellow">fungal</span> virulence on plant and animal hosts. Here we tested the ability of <span class="yellow">FGSC 9935</span> to cause disease in the <span class="yellow">greater wax moth</span> <span class="blue">Galleria mellonella</span>, an invertebrate model host that is widely used for the study of microbial <span class="yellow">human</span> pathogens. Injection of living but not of heat-killed microconidia into the hemocoel of <span class="yellow">G. mellonella</span> larvae resulted in dose-dependent killing both at 30^0C and at 37^0C. Fluorescence microscopy of larvae inoculated with a <span class="yellow">F. oxysporum transformant</span> expressing GFP revealed hyphal proliferation within the hemocoel, interaction with <span class="yellow">G. mellonella</span> hemocytes, and colonization of the killed insects by the fungus. Fungal gene knockout mutants previously tested in the <span class="yellow">tomato</span> and immunodepressed <span class="yellow">mouse</span> systems displayed a good correlation in virulence between the Galleria and the <span class="yellow">mouse</span> model. Thus, Galleria represents a useful non-vertebrate infection model for studying virulence mechanisms of <span class="yellow">F. oxysporum</span> on animal hosts. 
<h3>21145410</h3>Sequenced dermatophyte strains: growth rate, conidiation, drug susceptibilities, and virulence in an invertebrate model. <br><br>Although dermatophytes are the most common cause of <span class="yellow">fungal</span> infections in the world, their basic biology is not well understood. The recent sequencing and annotation of the genomes of five representative dermatophyte species allows for the creation of hypotheses as to how they cause disease and have adapted to their distinct environments. An understanding of the microbiology of these strains will be essential for testing these hypotheses. This study is the first to generally characterize these five sequenced strains of dermatophytes for their microbiological aspects. We measured the growth rate on solid medium and found differences between species, with <span class="yellow">Microsporum gypseum</span> CBS118893 having the fastest growth and <span class="yellow">Trichophyton rubrum</span> CBS118892 the slowest. We also compared different media for conidia production and found that the highest numbers of conidia were produced when dermatophytes were grown on MAT agar. We determined the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of nine antifungal agents and confirmed susceptibility to antifungals commonly used as selectable markers. Finally, we tested virulence in the <span class="blue">Galleria mellonella</span> (<span class="yellow">wax moth</span>) larvae model but found the results variable. These results increase our understanding of the microbiology and molecular biology of these dermatophyte strains and will be of use in advancing hypothesis-driven research about dermatophytes. 
<h3>22182612</h3>Comparative Impact of Artificial Selection for Fungicide Resistance on <span class="yellow">Beauveria bassiana</span> and <span class="yellow">Metarhizium brunneum</span>. <br><br>Hypocreales fungi such as <span class="yellow">Beauveria bassiana</span> (Balsamo) Vuillemin and <span class="yellow">Metarhizium brunneum</span> Petch can be negatively affected by fungicides thereby reducing their biocontrol potential. In a previous study, we demonstrated enhanced fungicide resistance in <span class="yellow">B. bassiana</span> through artificial selection. However, it is not clear if the enhanced resistance was because of improved germination, vegetative growth, or both. Additionally, the enhanced fungicide resistance has only been demonstrated in <span class="yellow">B. bassiana</span>, and therefore it is of interest to investigate the potential to enhance resistance in other fungi. Thus, the objectives in this study were to determine the potential to enhance fungicide resistance in <span class="yellow">M. brunneum</span> through artificial selection, and investigate if selection is based on germination, vegetative growth, or both in <span class="yellow">B. bassiana</span> and <span class="yellow">M. brunneum</span>. Selection for resistance to fenbuconazole, and triphenyltin hydroxide was assessed through inhibition evaluations on solid media, and germination and mycelial growth in liquid media. Increased resistance after selection was observed for all fungicide-fungus combinations on solid and or liquid media. Selection resulted in increased resistance to fenbuconazole in both fungi in solid and liquid media; in liquid culture fungicide resistance in <span class="yellow">B. bassiana</span> was manifested by increased germination and mycelial growth, whereas in <span class="yellow">M. brunneum</span> fungicide resistance concerned only mycelial growth. Selection for resistance to triphenyltin hydroxide varied in the different media. For <span class="yellow">B. bassiana</span>, triphenyltin hydroxide resistance was enhanced on solid media but not in liquid, whereas enhanced resistance of <span class="yellow">M. brunneum</span> was detected in both media. Fungicide sensitivity and selection potential differs based on the medium and <span class="yellow">fungal</span> species. Selection for fungicide resistance, had negative effects on other beneficial traits when fungicide pressure was removed, for example, some selected populations showed decreased germination or growth, relative to their nonselected control populations. Additionally, reduced virulence to the <span class="yellow">greater wax moth</span>, <span class="blue">Galleria mellonella</span> (L.), was observed in all <span class="yellow">fungal</span> populations that were exposed to fungicide resistance regimes. We conclude that it is possible to use genetic selection to enhance fungicide resistance in <span class="yellow">B. bassiana</span> and <span class="yellow">M. brunneum</span>, but before use the resulting populations should be screened for inadvertent negative impacts on beneficial traits.
