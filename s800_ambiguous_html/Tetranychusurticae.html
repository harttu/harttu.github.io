<h2>Tetranychus urticae</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20735493</h3>Parallel evolution of cytochrome b mediated bifenazate resistance in the <span class="annotated ">citrus red mite</span> <span class="annotated ">Panonychus citri</span>. <br><br>Bifenazate is a recently developed acaricide that is mainly used to control spider mites on a variety of crops. Although first thought to be a neurotoxin, genetic evidence obtained from bifenazate resistant <span class="match annotated ">Tetranychus urticae</span> strains suggested an alternative mode of action as a Qo pocket inhibitor of the mitochondrial complex III. In this study, we reveal how bifenazate resistance in strains of <span class="annotated ">Panonychus citri</span> is maternally inherited and can confer cross-resistance to the known Qo inhibitor acequinocyl. The mitochondrial genome of <span class="annotated ">P. citri</span> was sequenced and Qo pocket mutations were shown to be linked with the resistant trait. Parallel evolution of cytochrome b mediated bifenazate resistance corroborates the alternative mode of action and yet again illustrates that care should be taken when employing Qo inhibitors as crop protection compounds. 
<h3>21199022</h3>Effects of Wolbachia on mtDNA variation and evolution in natural populations of <span class="match annotated ">Tetranychus urticae</span> Koch. <br><br>We investigated the effects of Wolbachia infection on mtDNA variation in spider mites by sequencing a portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene from 198 individuals of known infection status. Four Wolbachia strains were described in the current study, namely wUrtOri1, wUrtOri2, wUrtOri3 and wUrtCon1. As predicted, the haplotype and nucleotide diversity were lower in infected individuals than in uninfected individuals. However, these mtDNA haplotype data are not entirely concordant with the surface protein of wolbachia (wsp) sequence data and both infected and uninfected individuals were found of the same haplotype. Although values of Tajima's D and Fu &amp; Li's F were consistently less than zero for most infected groups, McDonald-Kreitman tests suggested that the patterns of variation were different from those expected under neutrality in only the uninfected group. Thus, the neutrality tests do not show a clear effect of Wolbachia infection on patterns of mtDNA variation and substitution in spider mites.
