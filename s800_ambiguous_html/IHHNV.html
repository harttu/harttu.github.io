<h2>IHHNV</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20887752</h3>Rapid and sensitive detection of <span class="yellow">infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus</span> by loop-mediated isothermal amplification combined with a lateral flow dipstick. 

<span class="yellow">Infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus</span> (<span class="blue">IHHNV</span>) is an important shrimp pathogen that causes mortality in <span class="yellow">Penaeus stylirostris</span> and stunting (called runt deformity syndrome or RDS) in <span class="yellow">Penaeus vannamei</span>. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) allows rapid amplification of nucleic acids under isothermal conditions. It can be combined with a chromatographic lateral flow dipstick (LFD) for highly specific, rapid and simple visual detection of <span class="blue">IHHNV</span>-specific amplicons. Using this protocol, a 30-min amplification followed by 5 min hybridization with an FITC-labeled DNA probe and 5 min LFD resulted in visualization of DNA amplicons trapped at the LFD test line. Thus, 10 min for rapid DNA extraction followed by LAMP combined with LFD detection resulted in a total assay time of approximately 50 min. Detection sensitivity was comparable to other methods used commonly for nested PCR detection of <span class="blue">IHHNV</span> but had the additional advantages of reduced assay time, confirmation of amplicon identity by hybridization and elimination of electrophoresis with carcinogenic ethidium bromide.
