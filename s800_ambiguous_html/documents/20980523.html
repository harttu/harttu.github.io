<h2>20980523</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr>T cell-mediated protection against <span class="annotated ">lethal 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus</span> infection in a <span class="unannotated ">mouse</span> model. <br><br>Genetic mutation and reassortment of <span class="annotated ">influenza virus</span> gene segments, in particular those of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), that lead to antigenic drift and shift are the major strategies for <span class="annotated ">influenza virus</span> to escape preexisting immunity. The most recent example of such phenomena is the first pandemic of <span class="annotated ">H1N1 influenza</span> of the 21st century, which started in 2009. Cross-reactive antibodies raised against <span class="annotated ">H1N1 viruses</span> circulating before 1930 show protective activity against the <span class="annotated ">2009 pandemic virus</span>. Cross-reactive T-cell responses can also contribute to protection, but in vivo support of this view is lacking. To explore the protection mechanisms in vivo, we primed <span class="unannotated ">mice</span> with <span class="annotated ">H1</span> and <span class="annotated ">H3 influenza virus</span> isolates and rechallenged them with a <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> derived from the <span class="annotated ">2009 H1N1 A/CA/04/09 virus</span>, named CA/E3/09. We found that priming with <span class="unannotated ">influenza viruses</span> of both <span class="annotated ">H1</span> and H3 homo- and heterosubtypes protected against lethal CA/E3/09 <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> challenge. Convalescent-phase sera from these primed <span class="unannotated ">mice</span> conferred no neutralization activity in vitro and no protection in vivo. However, T-cell depletion studies suggested that both CD4 and CD8 T cells contributed to the protection. Taken together, these results indicate that cross-reactive T cells established after initial priming with distally related viruses can be a vital component for prevention of disease and control of <span class="annotated ">pandemic H1N1 influenza virus</span> infection. Our results highlight the importance of establishing cross-reactive T-cell responses for protecting against existing or newly emerging pandemic <span class="unannotated ">influenza viruses</span>.
