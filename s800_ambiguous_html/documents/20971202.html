<h2>20971202</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEAUS only</span><br><hr>Ste50 adaptor protein governs sexual differentiation of <span class="annotated ">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> via the pheromone-response MAPK signaling pathway. <br><br>The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways control diverse cellular functions in pathogenic fungi, including sexual differentiation, stress response, and maintenance of cell wall integrity. Here we characterized a <span class="annotated ">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> gene, which is homologous to the <span class="unannotated ">yeast</span> Ste50 that is known to play an important role in mating pheromone response and stress response as an adaptor protein to the Ste11 MAPK kinase kinase in <span class="annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>. The <span class="annotated ">C. neoformans</span> Ste50 was not involved in any of the stress responses or virulence factor production (capsule and melanin) that are controlled by the HOG and Ras/cAMP signaling pathways. However, Ste50 was required for mating in both <span class="annotated ">serotype A</span> and <span class="annotated ">serotype D C. neoformans</span> strains. The ste50Delta mutant was completely defective in cell-cell fusion and mating pheromone production. Double mutation of the STE50 gene blocked increased production of pheromone and the hyper-filamentation phenotype of cells deleted of the CRG1 gene, which encodes the RGS protein that negatively regulates pheromone responsive G-protein signaling via the MAPK pathway. Regardless of the presence of the basidiomycota-specific SH3 domains of Ste50 that are known to be required for full virulence of <span class="annotated ">Ustilago maydis</span>, Ste50 was dispensable for virulence of <span class="annotated ">C. neoformans</span> in a <span class="linneaus_only ">murine</span> model of cryptococcosis. In conclusion, the Ste50 adaptor protein controls sexual differentiation of <span class="annotated ">C. neoformans</span> via the pheromone-responsive MAPK pathway but is not required for virulence.
