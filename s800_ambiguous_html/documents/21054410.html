<h2>21054410</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr>Possible contributions of TERMINAL FLOWER 1 to the evolution of rosette flowering in Leavenworthia (Brassicaceae). <br><br><span class="annotated ">Leavenworthia crassa</span> is a rosette flowering species that differs from inflorescence flowering species, such as <span class="annotated ">Arabidopsis thaliana</span>, in having elongated pedicels and shortened interfloral internodes on the main axis. Based on previous experiments, we hypothesized that changes to the <span class="unannotated ">L. crassa</span> TFL1 ortholog, LcrTFL1, were important in the evolution of rosette flowering. We isolated LcrTFL1 and introduced a genomic construct into tfl1 mutant <span class="annotated ">A. thaliana</span> plants. We also generated and analyzed EGFP-LcrTFL1 reporter-fusion lines, and LcrTFL1/LcrLFY doubly transgenic lines. The transgene rescued the mutant defects, but manifested gain-of-function phenotypes. However, LcrTFL1 lines differed from 35S:TFL1 lines in several regards. Defects in floral meristem identity establishment were observed, as was the production of flowers with extra petals. We also noted features that resemble rosette flowering: LcrTFL1 lines produced significantly shorter interfloral internodes and significantly longer pedicels than either wild-type or 35S:TFL1 plants. Our data show that there are substantive differences in the regulation and/or function of TFL1 orthologs between <span class="annotated ">A. thaliana</span> and <span class="annotated ">L. crassa</span>. These may reflect changes that occurred during the evolution of rosette flowering in Leavenworthia, but, if so, our results show that additional, as-yet-unidentified genes were involved in this instance of architectural evolution.
