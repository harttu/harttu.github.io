<h2>21241332</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr>The rate-limiting step for CO(2) assimilation at different temperatures is influenced by the leaf nitrogen content in several C(3) crop species. <br><br>Effects of nitrogen (N) supply on the limiting step of CO(2) assimilation rate (A) at 380 mumol mol(-1) CO(2) concentration (A(380) ) at several leaf temperatures were studied in several crops, since N nutrition alters N allocation between photosynthetic components. Contents of leaf N, ribulose 1*5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) and cytochrome f (cyt f) increased with increasing N supply, but the cyt f/Rubisco ratio decreased. Large leaf N content was linked to a high stomatal (g(s) ) and mesophyll conductance (g(m) ), but resulted in a lower intercellular (C(i) ) and chloroplast CO(2) concentration (C(c) ) because the increase in g(s) and g(m) was insufficient to compensate for change in A(380) . The A-C(c) response was used to estimate the maximum rate of RuBP carboxylation (V(cmax) ) and chloroplast electron transport (J(max) ). The J(max) /V(cmax) ratio decreased with reductions in leaf N content, which was consistent with the results of the cyt f/Rubisco ratio. Analysis using the C(3) photosynthesis model indicated that A(380) tended to be limited by RuBP carboxylation in plants grown at low N concentration, whereas it was limited by RuBP regeneration in plants grown at high N concentration. We conclude that the limiting step of A(380) depends on leaf N content and is mainly determined by N partitioning between Rubisco and electron transport components.
