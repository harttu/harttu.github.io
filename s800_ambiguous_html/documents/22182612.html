<h2>22182612</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr>Comparative Impact of Artificial Selection for Fungicide Resistance on <span class="annotated ">Beauveria bassiana</span> and <span class="annotated ">Metarhizium brunneum</span>. <br><br>Hypocreales fungi such as <span class="annotated ">Beauveria bassiana</span> (Balsamo) Vuillemin and <span class="annotated ">Metarhizium brunneum</span> Petch can be negatively affected by fungicides thereby reducing their biocontrol potential. In a previous study, we demonstrated enhanced fungicide resistance in <span class="annotated ">B. bassiana</span> through artificial selection. However, it is not clear if the enhanced resistance was because of improved germination, vegetative growth, or both. Additionally, the enhanced fungicide resistance has only been demonstrated in <span class="annotated ">B. bassiana</span>, and therefore it is of interest to investigate the potential to enhance resistance in other fungi. Thus, the objectives in this study were to determine the potential to enhance fungicide resistance in <span class="annotated ">M. brunneum</span> through artificial selection, and investigate if selection is based on germination, vegetative growth, or both in <span class="annotated ">B. bassiana</span> and <span class="annotated ">M. brunneum</span>. Selection for resistance to fenbuconazole, and triphenyltin hydroxide was assessed through inhibition evaluations on solid media, and germination and mycelial growth in liquid media. Increased resistance after selection was observed for all fungicide-fungus combinations on solid and or liquid media. Selection resulted in increased resistance to fenbuconazole in both fungi in solid and liquid media; in liquid culture fungicide resistance in <span class="annotated ">B. bassiana</span> was manifested by increased germination and mycelial growth, whereas in <span class="annotated ">M. brunneum</span> fungicide resistance concerned only mycelial growth. Selection for resistance to triphenyltin hydroxide varied in the different media. For <span class="annotated ">B. bassiana</span>, triphenyltin hydroxide resistance was enhanced on solid media but not in liquid, whereas enhanced resistance of <span class="annotated ">M. brunneum</span> was detected in both media. Fungicide sensitivity and selection potential differs based on the medium and <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> species. Selection for fungicide resistance, had negative effects on other beneficial traits when fungicide pressure was removed, for example, some selected populations showed decreased germination or growth, relative to their nonselected control populations. Additionally, reduced virulence to the <span class="annotated ">greater wax moth</span>, <span class="annotated ">Galleria mellonella</span> (L.), was observed in all <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> populations that were exposed to fungicide resistance regimes. We conclude that it is possible to use genetic selection to enhance fungicide resistance in <span class="annotated ">B. bassiana</span> and <span class="annotated ">M. brunneum</span>, but before use the resulting populations should be screened for inadvertent negative impacts on beneficial traits.
