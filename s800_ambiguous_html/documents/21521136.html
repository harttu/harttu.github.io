<h2>21521136</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr>Host plant effects on alkaline phosphatase activity in the whiteflies, <span class="annotated ">Bemisia tabaci</span> Biotype B and <span class="annotated ">Trialeurodes vaporariorum</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Bemisia tabaci</span> (Gennadius) B-biotype and <span class="annotated ">Trialeurodes vaporariorum</span> (Westwood) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) often coexist on greenhouse-grown vegetable crops in northern China. The recent spread of <span class="annotated ">B. tabaci</span> B-biotype has largely replaced <span class="annotated ">T. vaporariorum</span>, and B-biotype now overlaps with <span class="annotated ">T. vaporariorum</span> where common hosts occur in most invaded areas. The impact of the B-biotype on the agro eco system appears to be widespread, and involves the ability to compete with and perhaps replace other phytophages like <span class="annotated ">T. vaporariorum</span>. An emerging hypothesis is that the B-biotype is physiologically superior due at least in part to an improved ability to metabolically utilize the alkaline phosphatase pathway. To test this hypothesis, alkaline phosphatase activity was studied in the B-biotype and <span class="annotated ">T. vaporariorum</span> after feeding on a number of different hosts for a range of durations, with and without host switching. Alkaline phosphatase activity in <span class="annotated ">T. vaporariorum</span> was 1.45 to 2.53-fold higher than that of the B-biotype when fed on <span class="annotated ">tomato</span> for 4 and 24 h, or switched from <span class="annotated ">tomato</span> to <span class="annotated ">cotton</span> and <span class="annotated ">cabbage</span> for the same durations. However, alkaline phosphatase activity in the B-biotype was 1.40 to 3.35-fold higher than that of <span class="annotated ">T. vaporariorum</span> when the host switching time was -72 and -120 h on the same plant. Both short-term (4 h) and long-term (72 h) switching of plant hosts can significantly affect the alkaline phosphatase activity in the two species. After -120 h, feeding on <span class="annotated ">tomato</span> and <span class="annotated ">cotton</span> alkaline phosphatase activity in the B-biotype was significantly higher than that of <span class="annotated ">T. vaporariorum</span>. It was shown that alkaline phosphatase aids the species feeding on different plant species, and that the B-biotype is physiologically superior to <span class="annotated ">T. vaporariorum</span> in utilizing the enzyme compared to <span class="annotated ">T. vaporariorum</span> over longer periods of feeding.
