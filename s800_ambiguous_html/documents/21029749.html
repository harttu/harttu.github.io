<h2>21029749</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEAUS only</span><br><hr>Double-antigen sandwich ELISA for the detection of anti-<span class="annotated ">hepatitis C virus</span> antibodies. <br><br>A double-antigen sandwich ELISA was developed a detection of <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> antibodies by a recombinant multi-epitope <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> antigen and a biotin-streptavidin amplification system. Three plasma specimens from 1708 individuals who were suspected previously to be <span class="annotated ">HCV</span>-positive using an <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> antibody diagnostic kit (Chuangxin, Xiamen, China) displayed negative results when using the ELISA. These results were validated by a recombinant immunoblotting assay (two were negative, and one was indeterminate). Among 889 blood specimens donated for clinical evaluation, 246 were positive and 630 were negative using the ELISA. The sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA were 98.7% and 100%, respectively. In 43 donors and 14 <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span> with chronic hepatitis C, the detectable rates for <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> IgM by both ELISA and the <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> anti-IgM detection reagents (Huimin, Shenyang, China) were 100%, and the detectable rate for <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> IgG using an indirect <span class="annotated ">HCV</span>-antibody detection kit (GWK, Beijing, China) was 98.3%. Thus, the double-antigen sandwich ELISA exhibits strong specificity and sensitivity and has been approved by the China State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA). The performance of the double-antigen sandwich ELISA was similar to the Ortho ELISA 3.0. It did not give false-negative results otherwise IgM was undetectable using an indirect <span class="annotated ">HCV</span>-antibody detection kit. This ELISA provides another method for the detection of <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> antibodies.
