<h2>20980524</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEAUS only</span><br><hr>Association of TRIM22 with the type 1 interferon response and <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> control during primary <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> infection. <br><br>Type 1 interferons (IFNs) induce the expression of the tripartite interaction motif (TRIM) family of E3 ligases, but the contribution of these antiviral factors to <span class="annotated ">HIV</span> pathogenesis is not completely understood. We hypothesized that the increased expression of select type 1 IFN and TRIM isoforms is associated with a significantly lower likelihood of <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> acquisition and <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> control during primary <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> infection. We measured IFN-alpha, IFN-Beta, myxovirus resistance protein <span class="unannotated ">A</span> (MxA), <span class="annotated ">human</span> TRIM5alpha (huTRIM5alpha), and TRIM22 mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of high-risk, <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span>-uninfected <span class="linneaus_only ">participants</span> and <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span>-positive study <span class="linneaus_only ">participants</span>. Samples were available for 32 uninfected subjects and 28 infected <span class="linneaus_only ">persons</span>, all within 1 year of infection. <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span>-positive <span class="linneaus_only ">participants</span> had higher levels of IFN-Beta (P = 0.0005), MxA (P = 0.007), and TRIM22 (P = 0.01) and lower levels of huTRIM5alpha (P &lt; 0.001) than did <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span>-negative <span class="linneaus_only ">participants</span>. TRIM22 but not huTRIM5alpha correlated positively with type 1 IFN (IFN-alpha, IFN-Beta, and MxA) (all P &lt; 0.0001). In a multivariate model, increased MxA expression showed a significant positive association with <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> load (P = 0.0418). Furthermore, TRIM22 but not huTRIM5alpha, IFN-alpha, IFN-Beta, or MxA showed a negative correlation with plasma <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> load (P = 0.0307) and a positive correlation with CD4(+) T-cell counts (P = 0.0281). In vitro studies revealed that <span class="annotated ">HIV</span> infection induced TRIM22 expression in PBMCs obtained from <span class="annotated ">HIV</span>-negative donors. Stable TRIM22 knockdown resulted in increased <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> particle release and replication in Jurkat reporter cells. Collectively, these data suggest concordance between type 1 IFN and TRIM22 but not huTRIM5alpha expression in PBMCs and that TRIM22 likely acts as an antiviral effector in vivo.
