<h2>21435708</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr>Viral pneumonia.<br><br>About 200 million cases of <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> community-acquired pneumonia occur every year-100 million in <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">children</span> and 100 million in adults. Molecular diagnostic tests have greatly increased our understanding of the role of <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span> in pneumonia, and findings indicate that the incidence of <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> pneumonia has been underestimated. In <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">children</span>, <span class="annotated ">respiratory syncytial virus</span>, rhinovirus, <span class="annotated ">human metapneumovirus</span>, <span class="annotated ">human bocavirus</span>, and parainfluenza <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span> are the agents identified most frequently in both developed and developing countries. Dual <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> infections are common, and a third of <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">children</span> have evidence of viral-bacterial co-infection. In adults, <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span> are the putative causative agents in a third of cases of community-acquired pneumonia, in particular <span class="annotated ">influenza viruses</span>, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses. Bacteria continue to have a predominant role in adults with pneumonia. Presence of <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> epidemics in the community, patient's age, speed of onset of illness, symptoms, biomarkers, radiographic changes, and response to treatment can help differentiate <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> from bacterial pneumonia. However, no clinical algorithm exists that will distinguish clearly the cause of pneumonia. No clear consensus has been reached about whether <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> with obvious <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> community-acquired pneumonia need to be treated with antibiotics. Apart from neuraminidase inhibitors for pneumonia caused by <span class="annotated ">influenza viruses</span>, there is no clear role for use of specific antivirals to treat <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> community-acquired pneumonia. Influenza vaccines are the only available specific preventive measures. Further studies are needed to better understand the cause and pathogenesis of community-acquired pneumonia. Furthermore, regional differences in cause of pneumonia should be investigated, in particular to obtain more data from developing countries.
