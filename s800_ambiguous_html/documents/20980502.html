<h2>20980502</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr>Cytomegalovirus microRNA expression is tissue specific and is associated with persistence. <br><br>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs involved in posttranscriptional regulation. miRNAs are utilized in organisms ranging from plants to higher mammals, and data have shown that DNA <span class="unannotated ">viruses</span> also use this method for host and <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> gene regulation. Here, we report the sequencing of the small RNAs in <span class="annotated ">rat cytomegalovirus</span> (<span class="annotated ">RCMV</span>)-infected fibroblasts and persistently infected salivary glands. We identified 24 unique miRNAs that mapped to hairpin structures found within the <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> genome. While most miRNAs were detected in both samples, four were detected exclusively in the infected fibroblasts and two were specific for the infected salivary glands. The <span class="annotated ">RCMV</span> miRNAs are distributed across the <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> genome on both the positive and negative strands, with clusters of miRNAs at a number of locations, including near <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> genes r1 and r111. The <span class="annotated ">RCMV</span> miRNAs have a genomic positional orientation similar to that of the miRNAs described for <span class="annotated ">mouse cytomegalovirus</span>, but they do not share any substantial sequence conservation. Similar to other reported miRNAs, the <span class="annotated ">RCMV</span> miRNAs had considerable variation at their 3' and 5' ends. Interestingly, we found a number of specific examples of differential isoform usage between the fibroblast and salivary gland samples. We determined by real-time PCR that expression of the <span class="annotated ">RCMV</span> miRNA miR-r111.1-2 is highly expressed in the salivary glands and that miR-R87-1 is expressed in most tissues during the acute infection phase. Our study identified the miRNAs expressed by <span class="annotated ">RCMV</span> in vitro and in vivo and demonstrated that expression is tissue specific and associated with a stage of <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> infection.
