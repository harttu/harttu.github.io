<h2>21111055</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEAUS only</span><br><hr>Mating differentiation in <span class="annotated ">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> is negatively regulated by the Crk1 protein kinase. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> is a heterothallic basidiomycete that grows vegetatively as <span class="annotated ">yeast</span> and filamentous hyphae are produced in the sexual state. Previous studies have shown that <span class="annotated ">C. neoformans</span> Cwc1 and Cwc2 are two central photoregulators which form a complex to inhibit the production of sexual filaments upon light treatment. To reveal the detailed regulatory mechanisms, a genome wide mutagenesis screen was conducted and components in the Cwc1/Cwc2 complex mediated pathway have been identified. In this study, one suppressor mutant, DJ22, is characterized and T-DNA is found to disrupt the <span class="annotated ">C. neoformans</span> CRK1 gene, a homologue of <span class="annotated ">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> IME2 and <span class="annotated ">Ustilago maydis</span> crk1. Ime2 is a meiosis-specific gene with the conserved Ser/Thr kinase domain and TXY dual phosphorylation site. Consistent with the findings of other suppressors in our screen, <span class="annotated ">C. neoformans</span> Crk1 plays a negative role in the mating process. Dikaryotic filaments, basidia, and basidiospores are produced earlier in the crk1 mutant crosses and mating efficiency is also increased. Artificial elevation of the CRK1 mRNA level inhibits mating. Interestingly, monokaryotic fruiting is defective both in the MATalpha crk1 mutant and CRK1 overexpression strains. Our studies demonstrate that <span class="unannotated ">C. neoformans</span> CRK1 gene functions as a negative regulator in the mating differentiation.
