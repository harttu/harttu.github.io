<h2>21034775</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEAUS only</span><br><hr>Cross-genotypic polyclonal anti-<span class="annotated ">HCV</span> antibodies from <span class="annotated ">human</span> ascitic fluid.<br><br>Many anti-<span class="annotated ">HCV</span> antibodies are available, but more are needed for research and clinical applications. This study examines whether ascitic fluid from cirrhotic <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span> could be a source of reagent-grade antibodies. Ascitic fluid from 29 <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span> was screened by ELISA for anti-<span class="annotated ">HCV</span> antibodies against three <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> proteins: core, NS4B, and NS5A. Significant patient-to-patient variability in anti-<span class="annotated ">HCV</span> antibody titers was observed. Total ascitic fluid IgG purified by Protein-A chromatography reacted with <span class="annotated ">HCV</span> proteins in immunoblots, cell extracts, and replicon-expressing cells. Affinity-purification using synthetic peptides as bait allowed the preparation of cross-genotypic antibodies directed against pre-selected regions of <span class="unannotated ">HCV</span> core, NS4B, and NS5A proteins. The performance of the polyclonal antibodies was comparable to that of monoclonal antibodies. Anti-NS4B antibody preparations reacted with genotype 1a, 1b, and 2a NS4B proteins in immunoblots and allowed NS4B to be localized in replicon-expressing cells. Ascitic fluid is an abundant source of <span class="annotated ">human</span> polyclonal cross-genotypic antibodies that can be used as an alternative to blood. This study shows the utility of selectively purifying <span class="annotated ">human</span> polyclonal antibodies from ascitic fluid. Affinity purification allows antibodies to be selected that are comparable to monoclonal antibodies in their ability to react with targeted regions of <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> proteins.
