<h2>20962086</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><span class="annotated ">Poliovirus</span>-mediated disruption of cytoplasmic processing bodies.<br><br>Metazoan cells form cytoplasmic mRNA granules such as stress granules (SG) and processing bodies (P bodies) that are proposed to be sites of aggregated, translationally silenced mRNAs and mRNA degradation. <span class="annotated ">Poliovirus</span> (<span class="annotated ">PV</span>) is a plus-strand RNA virus containing a genome that is a functional mRNA; thus, we investigated if <span class="annotated ">PV</span> antagonizes the processes that lead to formation of these structures. We have previously shown that <span class="annotated ">PV</span> infection inhibits the ability of cells to form stress granules by cleaving RasGAP-SH3-binding protein (G3BP). Here, we show that P bodies are also disrupted during <span class="annotated ">PV</span> infection in cells by 4 h postinfection. The disruption of P bodies is more rapid and more complete than disruption of stress granules. The kinetics of P body disruption correlated with production of <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> proteinases and required substantial <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> gene product expression. The organizing mechanism that forms P body foci in cells is unknown; however, potential scaffolding, aggregating, or other regulatory proteins found in P bodies were investigated for degradation. Two factors involved in 5'-end mRNA decapping and degradation, Xrn1 and Dcp1a, and the 3' deadenylase complex component Pan3 underwent accelerated degradation during infection, and Dcp1a may be a direct substrate of <span class="annotated ">PV</span> 3C proteinase. Several other key factors proposed to be essential for P body formation, GW182, Edc3, and Edc4, were unaffected by <span class="annotated ">poliovirus</span> infection. Since deadenylation has been reported to be required for P body formation, <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> inhibition of deadenylation, through Pan3 degradation, is a potential mechanism of P body disruption.
