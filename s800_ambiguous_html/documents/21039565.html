<h2>21039565</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEAUS only</span><br><hr>Aerenchyma formation in the <span class="annotated ">rice</span> stem and its promotion by H2O2.<br><br>* Gas spaces (aerenchyma) form as an adaptation to submergence to facilitate gas exchange. In <span class="annotated ">rice</span> (<span class="annotated ">Oryza sativa</span>), aerenchyma develop by cell death and lysis, which are poorly understood at the cellular level. * Aerenchyma formation was studied in <span class="annotated ">rice</span> stems by light microscopy. It was analyzed in response to submergence, ethylene and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) treatment, and in the MT2b::Tos17 mutant. O(2)*(-) was detected with nitroblue tetrazolium and an epinephrine assay. H(2)O(2) was detected with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine. * Aerenchyma develop constitutively in all internodes of the deep-water <span class="annotated ">rice</span> variety Pin Gaew 56, but are absent from the nodes. Constitutive aerenchyma formation was also observed in two lowland <span class="annotated ">rice</span> varieties, albeit to a lesser degree. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> larger number of aerenchyma are present in older internodes, and at the top of each internode, revealing developmental gradients. Submergence or treatment with the ethylene-releasing compound ethephon promoted aerenchyma formation in all genotypes analyzed. Pre-aerenchymal cells contain less starch, no chloroplasts, thinner cell walls and produce elevated levels of O(2)*(-) and H(2)O(2) compared with other parenchymal cells. Ethephon promotes O(2)*(-) formation and H(2)O(2) promotes aerenchyma formation in a dose-dependent manner. Further-more, genetic downregulation of the H(2)O(2) scavenger MT2b enhances aerenchyma formation. * Aerenchyma formation is mediated by reactive oxygen species.
