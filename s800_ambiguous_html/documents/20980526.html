<h2>20980526</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEAUS only</span><br><hr>An in-depth analysis of original antigenic sin in <span class="annotated ">dengue virus</span> infection.<br><br>The evolution of <span class="annotated ">dengue viruses</span> has resulted in four antigenically similar yet distinct serotypes. Infection with one serotype likely elicits lifelong immunity to that serotype, but generally not against the other three. Secondary or sequential infections are common, as multiple <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> serotypes frequently cocirculate. <span class="annotated ">Dengue</span> infection, although frequently mild, can lead to <span class="annotated ">dengue</span> hemorrhagic fever (DHF) which can be life threatening. DHF is more common in secondary <span class="annotated ">dengue</span> infections, implying a role for the adaptive immune response in the disease. There is currently much effort toward the design and implementation of a <span class="unannotated ">dengue</span> vaccine but these efforts are made more difficult by the challenge of inducing durable neutralizing immunity to all four viruses. Domain 3 of the <span class="annotated ">dengue virus</span> envelope protein (ED3) has been suggested as one such candidate because it contains neutralizing epitopes and it was originally thought that relatively few cross-reactive antibodies are directed to this domain. In this study, we performed a detailed analysis of the anti-ED3 response in a cohort of <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span> suffering either primary or secondary <span class="annotated ">dengue</span> infections. The results show dramatic evidence of original antigenic sin in secondary infections both in terms of binding and enhancement activity. This has important implications for <span class="annotated ">dengue</span> vaccine design because heterologous boosting is likely to maintain the immunological footprint of the first vaccination. On the basis of these findings, we propose a simple in vitro enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to diagnose the original <span class="annotated ">dengue</span> infection in secondary <span class="annotated ">dengue</span> cases.
