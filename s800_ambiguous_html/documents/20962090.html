<h2>20962090</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr><span class="annotated ">Marek's disease virus type 1</span> microRNA miR-M3 suppresses cisplatin-induced apoptosis by targeting Smad2 of the transforming growth factor beta signal pathway. <br><br>Viruses cause about 15% of the cancers that are still the leading causes of <span class="annotated ">human</span> mortality. The discovery of <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> oncogenes has enhanced our understanding of <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> oncogenesis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of virus-induced cancers are complex and require further investigation. The present study has attempted to investigate the effects of the microRNAs (miRNAs) encoded by <span class="annotated ">Marek's disease virus 1</span> (<span class="annotated ">MDV1</span>), a <span class="annotated ">chicken</span> herpesvirus causing acute T-cell lymphomas and solid visceral tumors in <span class="annotated ">chickens</span>, on anti-cancer drug-induced apoptosis and identify the targets of the miRNAs. The results showed that of the total 14 miRNAs encoded by <span class="annotated ">MDV1</span>, <span class="annotated ">MDV1</span>-miR-M3 significantly promoted cell survival under treatment with cisplatin, a widely used chemotherapy drug. <span class="annotated ">MDV1</span>-miR-M3 suppressed cisplatin-induced apoptosis by directly downregulating expression at the protein but not the mRNA level of Smad2, a critical component in the transforming growth factor Beta signal pathway. Our data suggest that latent/oncogenic viruses may encode miRNAs to directly target cellular factors involved in antiviral processes including apoptosis, thus proactively creating a cellular environment beneficial to <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> latency and oncogenesis. Furthermore, the knowledge of the apoptosis resistance conferred by <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> miRNAs has great practical implications for improving the efficacy of chemotherapies for treating cancers, especially those induced by oncogenic viruses.
