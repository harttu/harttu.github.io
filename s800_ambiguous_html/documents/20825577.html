<h2>20825577</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEAUS only</span><br><hr>OsRAN2, essential for mitosis, enhances cold tolerance in <span class="annotated ">rice</span> by promoting export of intranuclear tubulin and maintaining cell division under cold stress. <br><br>With global climate change, abnormally low temperatures have affected the world's <span class="annotated ">rice</span> production. Many genes have been shown to be essential for molecular improvement of <span class="annotated ">rice</span> cold-tolerance traits. However, less is known about the molecular cellular mechanism of their response to cold stress. Here, we investigated OsRAN2 involved in regulation of cell division during cold stress in <span class="annotated ">rice</span>. Expression of OsRAN2 was increased under cold treatment, but not during salt and drought stress. The mean root mitotic index was closely related to the expression level of OsRAN2. Knockdown transgenic <span class="annotated ">rice</span> lines showed an aberrant organization of spindles during mitosis and stunted growth during development. Overexpression of OsRAN2 enhanced cold tolerance in <span class="annotated ">rice</span>. The transgenic <span class="annotated ">rice</span> overexpressing OsRAN2 showed maintained cell division, decreased proportion of cells with intranuclear tubulin and formation of a normal nuclear envelope under the cold condition. Our study suggests a mechanism for OsRAN2 in regulating cold resistance in <span class="annotated ">rice</span> by maintaining cell division through promoting the normal export of intranuclear tubulin at the end of mitosis. This insight could help improve the cold-tolerance trait in <span class="annotated ">rice</span>.
