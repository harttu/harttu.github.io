<h2>22056521</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr>Accumulation of P-bodies in <span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span> under different stress and filamentous growth conditions. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Candida albicans</span> is an opportunistic <span class="unannotated ">fungal</span> pathogen that grows as budding <span class="unannotated ">yeast</span>, pseudohyphal, and hyphal forms. In response to external signals, <span class="annotated ">C. albicans</span> switches rapidly among these forms. mRNA-containing cytoplasmic granules, termed processing bodies (P-bodies), have been reported to accumulate under various environmental stress conditions in diverse species from <span class="annotated ">yeast</span> to mammals. Here, we provide the first microscopic and genetic characterization of P-bodies in <span class="annotated ">C. albicans</span>. The core components of P-bodies, including the decapping machinery (Dcp2 and Dhh1), 5'-3' exoribonuclease (Kem1/Xrn1), and the P-body scaffolding protein (Edc3), were identified and their localizations with respect to P-bodies were demonstrated. Various growth conditions, including glucose deprivation, hyperosmotic stress, and heat stress, stimulated the accumulation of P-bodies. In addition, we observed P-body aggregation during hyphal development. The deletion mutant strain edc3/edc3 had a defect in filamentation and exhibited a dramatic reduction in the number of P-bodies. These results suggest that Edc3 plays an essential role in the assembly and maintenance of P-bodies in <span class="annotated ">C. albicans</span>, and that the switch to filamentous growth appears to accompany P-body accumulation.
