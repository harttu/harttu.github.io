<h2>20580606</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr>Treatment non-adherence in teenage and young adult <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> with cancer.<br><br>Adhering to treatment can be a significant issue for many <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> diagnosed with chronic health conditions and this has been reported to be greater during the adolescent years. However, little is known about treatment adherence in teenage and young adult (TYA) <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> with cancer. To increase awareness of the adherence challenges faced by these <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span>, we have reviewed the published work. The available evidence suggests that a substantial proportion of TYA <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> with cancer do have difficulties, with reports that up to 63% of <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> do not adhere to their treatment regimens. However, with inconsistent findings across studies, the true extent of non-adherence for these young <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> is still unclear. Furthermore, it is apparent that there are many components of the cancer treatment regimen that have yet to be assessed in relation to <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patient</span> adherence. Factors that have been shown to affect treatment adherence in TYA <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> include <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patient</span> emotional functioning (depression and self-esteem), <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patient</span> health beliefs (perceived illness severity and vulnerability), and family environment (parental support and parent-child concordance). Strategies that foster greater <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patient</span> adherence are also identified. These strategies are multifactorial, targeting not only the <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patient</span>, but the health professional, family, and treatment regimen. This review highlights the lack of interventional studies addressing treatment adherence in TYA <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> with cancer, with only one such intervention being identified: a video game intervention focusing on behavioural issues related to cancer treatment and care. Methodological issues in measuring adherence are addressed and suggestions for improving the design of future adherence studies highlighted, of which there is a great need.
