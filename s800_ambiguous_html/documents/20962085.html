<h2>20962085</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr>Novel F141L pre-S2 mutation in <span class="annotated ">hepatitis B virus</span> increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> with chronic genotype C infections. <br><br>Several lines of evidence have suggested that some naturally occurring mutations of <span class="annotated ">hepatitis B virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">HBV</span>) play a critical role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we describe a novel HCC-related pre-S2 mutation, F141L. To prove the relationship between the F141L mutation and HCC, molecular epidemiology studies using MboII PCR restriction analysis (PRA) were performed, and the molecular mechanism was investigated through construction of a stable hepatocyte cell line expressing the large surface HB protein (LHB) with the F141L mutation (F141L-LHB). Application of MboII PRA to samples from 241 Korean <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span> with chronic liver diseases of different clinical stages confirmed that F141L mutants were significantly related to HCC, even in comparison to liver cirrhosis (HCC, 26.3% of <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span>, or 26/99; liver cirrhosis, 3.8% of <span class="LINNAEUS_only ">patients</span>, or 2/52; P = 0.001). By studying stable cell lines, we found that F141L-LHBs could induce cell cycle progression by downregulating the p53 and p21 pathways and upregulating CDK4 and cyclin <span class="unannotated ">A</span>. Furthermore, we found that in a colony-forming assay, the colony-forming rates in cell lines expressing F141L-LHBs were about twice as high as those of the wild type. In conclusion, our results suggest that F141L-LHBs may contribute importantly to the pathogenesis of HCC by inducing cell proliferation and transformation. So, the F141L mutation examined in this study could serve as a diagnostic marker for the prognosis of HCC.
