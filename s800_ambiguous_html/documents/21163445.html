<h2>21163445</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEAUS only</span><br><hr>Clinical experience and laboratory investigations in <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span> with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. <br><br>Since its discovery in 2007, the encephalitis associated with antibodies against the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) has entered the mainstream of neurology and other disciplines. Most <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span> with anti-NMDAR encephalitis develop a multistage illness that progresses from psychosis, memory deficits, seizures, and language disintegration into a state of unresponsiveness with catatonic features often associated with abnormal movements, and autonomic and breathing instability. The disorder predominantly affects <span class="linneaus_only ">children</span> and young adults, occurs with or without tumour association, and responds to treatment but can relapse. The presence of a tumour (usually an ovarian teratoma) is dependent on age, sex, and ethnicity, being more frequent in <span class="linneaus_only ">women</span> older than 18 years, and slightly more predominant in <span class="unannotated ">black</span> <span class="linneaus_only ">women</span> than it is in white <span class="linneaus_only ">women</span>. <span class="linneaus_only ">Patients</span> treated with tumour resection and immunotherapy (corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, or plasma exchange) respond faster to treatment and less frequently need second-line immunotherapy (cyclophosphamide or rituximab, or both) than do <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span> without a tumour who receive similar initial immunotherapy. More than 75% of all <span class="linneaus_only ">patients</span> have substantial recovery that occurs in inverse order of symptom development and is associated with a decline of antibody titres. Patients' antibodies cause a titre-dependent, reversible decrease of synaptic NMDAR by a mechanism of crosslinking and internalisation. On the basis of models of pharmacological or genetic disruption of NMDAR, these antibody effects reveal a probable pathogenic relation between the depletion of receptors and the clinical features of anti-NMDAR encephalitis.
