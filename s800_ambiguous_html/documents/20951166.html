<h2>20951166</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="LINNAEUS_only">LINNAEUS only</span><br><hr>Rapid detection of <span class="annotated ">Newcastle disease virus</span> replication in embryonated <span class="annotated ">chicken</span> eggs using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Newcastle disease virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">NDV</span>), an avian paramyxovirus, is an economically important disease of <span class="annotated ">poultry</span> globally. Rapid methods to detect and differentiate the <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> are important to curtail the spread of this <span class="unannotated ">virus</span>. Nucleic acid based detection methods are routinely employed for diagnosis that suffer from the disadvantage of failure to discriminate viable <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> and non-infectious genome. However, <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> isolation remains the gold standard for diagnosis of field outbreaks. The sensitivity of <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> isolation was combined with nucleic acid based detection methods so that the time taken for confirmatory diagnosis could be considerably reduced while increasing sensitivity. Quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and conventional RT-PCR techniques were compared for the detection of <span class="annotated ">NDV</span> genome replication in 9-11-day-old embryonated <span class="annotated ">chicken</span> eggs (ECE) using the nucleoprotein (NP) gene of the <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> as a target. The results suggest that at least two to fourfold increase in cycle threshold (C(t)) values over the baseline C(t) value of samples lacking infectious <span class="unannotated ">virus</span>, would indicate live <span class="annotated ">NDV</span> replication. The limit of detection of <span class="annotated ">NDV</span> replication using qRT-PCR was 1x10(4.0) mean embryo infective doses (EID(50)). The earliest time point when live <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> replication was detectable by qRT-PCR or RT-PCR was 30h post-inoculation in ECE.
