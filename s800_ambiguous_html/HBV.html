Several lines of evidence have suggested that some naturally occurring mutations of <span class="yellow">hepatitis B virus</span> (<span class="blue">HBV</span>) play a critical role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we describe a novel HCC-related pre-S2 mutation, F141L. To prove the relationship between the F141L mutation and HCC, molecular epidemiology studies using MboII PCR restriction analysis (PRA) were performed, and the molecular mechanism was investigated through construction of a stable hepatocyte cell line expressing the large surface HB protein (LHB) with the F141L mutation (F141L-LHB). Application of MboII PRA to samples from 241 Korean patients with chronic liver diseases of different clinical stages confirmed that F141L mutants were significantly related to HCC, even in comparison to liver cirrhosis (HCC, 26.3% of patients, or 26/99; liver cirrhosis, 3.8% of patients, or 2/52; P = 0.001). By studying stable cell lines, we found that F141L-LHBs could induce cell cycle progression by downregulating the p53 and p21 pathways and upregulating CDK4 and cyclin <span class="yellow">A</span>. Furthermore, we found that in a colony-forming assay, the colony-forming rates in cell lines expressing F141L-LHBs were about twice as high as those of the wild type. In conclusion, our results suggest that F141L-LHBs may contribute importantly to the pathogenesis of HCC by inducing cell proliferation and transformation. So, the F141L mutation examined in this study could serve as a diagnostic marker for the prognosis of HCC. 
<h3>20962099</h3>Replicative and transcriptional activities of <span class="yellow">hepatitis B virus</span> in patients coinfected with <span class="yellow">hepatitis B</span> and <span class="yellow">hepatitis delta viruses</span>. 

<span class="yellow">Hepatitis B virus</span> (<span class="blue">HBV</span>) and <span class="yellow">hepatitis delta virus</span> (<span class="yellow">HDV</span>) interplay was investigated by examining liver and serum samples from 21 coinfected and 22 <span class="blue">HBV</span>-monoinfected patients with chronic liver disease. Different real-time PCR assays were applied to evaluate intrahepatic amounts of <span class="blue">HBV</span> DNA, covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), pregenomic RNA (pgRNA), pre-S/S RNAs, and <span class="yellow">HDV</span> RNA. Besides <span class="blue">HBV</span> DNA and <span class="yellow">HDV</span> RNA levels, HBsAg concentrations in the sera were also determined. <span class="yellow">HDV</span>-coinfected cases showed significantly lower median levels of serum <span class="blue">HBV</span> DNA (-5 log), intrahepatic relaxed-circular DNA (-2 log), and cccDNA (-2 log) than those of <span class="blue">HBV</span>-monoinfected cases. Interestingly, pgRNA and pre-S/S RNA amounts were significantly lower (both -1 log) in <span class="yellow">HDV</span>-positive patients, whereas serum HBsAg concentrations were comparable between the two patient groups. Pre-S/S RNA and HBsAg amounts per cccDNA molecule were higher in <span class="yellow">HDV</span>-positive patients (3-fold and 1 log, respectively), showing that <span class="blue">HBV</span> replication was reduced, whereas synthesis of envelope proteins was not specifically decreased. The ratios of cccDNA to intracellular total <span class="blue">HBV</span> DNA showed a larger proportion of cccDNA molecules in <span class="yellow">HDV</span>-positive cases. For these patients, both intrahepatic and serum <span class="yellow">HDV</span> RNA amounts were associated with cccDNA but not with HBsAg or <span class="red">HBV</span> DNA levels. Finally, <span class="red">HBV</span> genomes with large deletions in the basal core promoter/precore region were detected in 5/21 <span class="yellow">HDV</span>-positive patients but in no <span class="yellow">HDV</span>-negative patients and were associated with lower viremia levels. These findings provide significant information about the interference exerted by <span class="yellow">HDV</span> on <span class="blue">HBV</span> replication and transcription activities in the <span class="yellow">human</span> liver. 
<h3>21511329</h3><span class="yellow">Hepatitis delta virus</span>.

<span class="yellow">Hepatitis delta virus</span> (<span class="yellow">HDV</span>) is a small, defective RNA <span class="yellow">virus</span> that can infect only individuals who have <span class="yellow">hepatitis B virus</span> (<span class="blue">HBV</span>); worldwide more than 15 million people are co-infected. There are eight reported genotypes of <span class="yellow">HDV</span> with unexplained variations in their geographical distribution and pathogenicity. The <span class="yellow">hepatitis D</span> virion is composed of a coat of <span class="blue">HBV</span> envelope proteins surrounding the nucleocapsid, which consists of a single-stranded, circular RNA genome complexed with delta antigen, the <span class="yellow">viral</span> protein. <span class="yellow">HDV</span> is clinically important because although it suppresses <span class="blue">HBV</span> replication, it causes severe liver disease with rapid progression to cirrhosis and hepatic decompensation. The range of clinical presentation is wide, varying from mild disease to fulminant liver failure. The prevalence of <span class="yellow">HDV</span> is declining in some endemic areas but increasing in northern and central Europe because of immigration. Treatment of <span class="yellow">HDV</span> is with pegylated interferon alfa; however, response rates are poor. Increased understanding of the molecular virology of <span class="yellow">HDV</span> will identify novel therapeutic targets for this most severe form of chronic <span class="yellow">viral</span> hepatitis. 
<h3>20950650</h3>Rapid detection of drug-resistant mutations in <span class="yellow">hepatitis B virus</span> by the PCR-Invader assay. 

Early detection of resistant mutations of <span class="yellow">hepatitis B virus</span> (<span class="blue">HBV</span>) is important for patients on nucleos(t)ide analog therapy. An assay based on the PCR-Invader technology was developed to detect resistant mutations with high sensitivity. The assay specifically detects mutations at codons 180, 181, 184, 202, 204, and 250 of the <span class="blue">HBV</span> polymerase reverse transcriptase domain. These mutations result in resistance to lamivudine and entecavir. In mixtures of plasmids containing wild-type and resistant mutants, fold-over-zero values for resistant mutations were detected in 2% of the total. Seventy-five serum samples from patients, whose treatment had been switched from lamivudine to entecavir, were examined by the PCR-Invader assay and direct sequencing. The PCR-Invader assay detected all resistant mutations that were detected by direct sequencing and even detected the presence of mutants that direct sequencing could not. Cloning sequencing confirmed those mutations found by the PCR-Invader assay and not by direct sequencing. The PCR-Invader assay is a useful tool for the early detection of drug-resistant mutations.
