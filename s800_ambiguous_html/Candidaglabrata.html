<h2>Candida glabrata</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21145409</h3>Overexpression of the trichodiene synthase gene tri5 increases trichodermin production and antimicrobial activity in <span class="yellow">Trichoderma brevicompactum</span>. 

<span class="yellow">Trichoderma brevicompactum</span> produces trichodermin, a simple trichothecene-type toxin that shares the first steps of the sesquiterpene biosynthetic pathway with other phytotoxic trichothecenes from <span class="yellow">Fusarium spp</span>. Trichodiene synthase catalyses the conversion of farnesyl pyrophosphate to trichodiene and it is encoded by the tri5 gene that was cloned and analysed functionally by homologous overexpression in <span class="yellow">T. brevicompactum</span>. tri5 expression was up-regulated in media with glucose, H(2)O(2) or glycerol. tri5 repression was observed in cultures supplemented with the antioxidants ferulic acid and tyrosol. Acetone extracts of tri5-overexpressing transformants displayed higher antifungal activity than those from the wild-type. Chromatographic and spectroscopic analyses revealed that tri5 overexpression led to an increased production of trichodermin and tyrosol. Agar diffusion assays with these two purified metabolites from the tri5-overexpressing transformant <span class="yellow">T. brevicompactum</span> Tb41tri5 showed that only trichodermin had antifungal activity against <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, <span class="yellow">Kluyveromyces marxianus</span>, <span class="yellow">Candida albicans</span>, <span class="blue">Candida glabrata</span>, <span class="yellow">Candida tropicalis</span> and <span class="yellow">Aspergillus fumigatus</span>, in most cases such activity being higher than that observed for amphotericin B and hygromycin. Our results point to the significant role of tri5 in the production of trichodermin and in the antifungal activity of <span class="yellow">T. brevicompactum</span>. 
<h3>21272794</h3>Emerging opportunistic <span class="yellow">yeast</span> infections.

A growing population of immunosuppressed patients has resulted in increasingly frequent diagnoses of invasive <span class="yellow">fungal</span> infections, including those caused by unusual <span class="yellow">yeasts</span>. The incidence of non-albicans species of Candida is increasing compared with that of <span class="yellow">Candida albicans</span>, and several species, such as <span class="blue">Candida glabrata</span> and <span class="yellow">Candida krusei</span>, may be resistant to azole antifungal therapy. Trichosporon species are the second most common cause of fungaemia in patients with haematological malignant disease and are characterised by resistance to amphotericin and echinocandins and poor prognosis. Rhodotorula species belong to the family Cryptococcaceae, and are a cause of catheter-related fungaemia, sepsis, and invasive disease in severely immunosuppressed patients. An increasing number of sporadic cases of invasive <span class="yellow">fungal</span> infections by non-neoformans cryptococci have been reported in immunocompromised hosts, especially for patients with advanced <span class="yellow">HIV</span> infection or cancer who are undergoing transplant. Other uncommon <span class="yellow">yeasts</span> that can cause invasive disease in severely immunosuppressed patients include Geotrichum, Hansenula, Malassezia, and Saccharomyces. Host immune status is a crucial determinant of the type of invasive <span class="yellow">fungal</span> infection a patient is at risk for. Diagnosis can be challenging and relies heavily on traditional cultures of blood and other sterile sites, although serum (1,3)-Beta-D-glucan testing might have an adjunctive role. Although rare <span class="yellow">yeasts</span> are emerging as opportunistic <span class="yellow">human</span> pathogens, diagnosis remains challenging and treatment suboptimal.
