</br>
Vaccination with heptavalent <b>pneumococcal</b> conjugate vaccine ( PCV7 ) has significantly reduced the burden of <b>pneumococcal</b> disease and has had an important public health benefit . 
</br>
Because this vaccine targets only seven of the more than 92 <b>pneumococcal</b> serotypes , concerns have been raised that non - vaccine serotypes ( NVTs ) could increase in prevalence and reduce the benefits of vaccination . 
</br>
In many populations , <b>pneumococcal</b> disease caused by NVT has increased , but in most cases this increase has been less than the increase in NVT carriage .
