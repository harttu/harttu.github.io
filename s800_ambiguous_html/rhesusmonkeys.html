<h2>rhesus monkeys</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20980517</h3>A recombinant <span class="annotated ">measles virus</span> unable to antagonize STAT1 function cannot control inflammation and is attenuated in <span class="match annotated ">rhesus monkeys</span>. <br><br>Measles remains a leading cause of death worldwide among <span class="linneaus_only ">children</span> because it suppresses immune function. The <span class="annotated ">measles virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">MV</span>) P gene encodes three proteins (P, V, and C) that interfere with innate immunity, controlling STAT1, STAT2, mda5, and perhaps other key regulators of immune function. We identified here three residues in the shared domain of the P and V proteins-tyrosine 110, valine 112, and histidine 115-that function to retain STAT1 in the cytoplasm and inhibit interferon transcription. This information was used to generate a recombinant <span class="annotated ">measles virus</span> unable to antagonize STAT1 function (STAT1-blind <span class="annotated ">MV</span>) differing only in these three residues from a wild-type strain of well-defined virulence. This <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> was used to assess the relevance of P and V interactions with STAT1 for virulence in primates. When a group of six <span class="match annotated ">rhesus monkeys</span> (<span class="annotated ">Macaca mulatta</span>) was inoculated intranasally with STAT1-blind <span class="annotated ">MV</span>, viremia was short-lived, and the skin rash and other clinical signs observed with wild-type <span class="annotated ">MV</span> were absent. The STAT1-blind <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> less efficiently controlled the inflammatory response, as measured by enhanced transcription of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from infected hosts. Importantly, neutralizing antibody titers and <span class="annotated ">MV</span>-specific T-cell responses were equivalent in hosts infected with either <span class="unannotated ">virus</span>. These findings indicate that efficient <span class="annotated ">MV</span> interactions with STAT1 are required to sustain virulence in a natural host by controlling the inflammatory response against the <span class="unannotated ">virus</span>. They also suggest that selectively STAT1-blind <span class="annotated ">MV</span> may have utility as vectors for targeted oncolysis and vaccination.
