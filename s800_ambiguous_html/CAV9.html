<h2>CAV9</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20974179</h3>A combined method for rescue of modified enteroviruses by mutagenic primers, long PCR and T7 RNA polymerase-driven in vivo transcription. <br><br>The current methods for manipulation of enteroviral RNA genomes and production of modified <span class="yellow">virus</span> particles include stepwise subcloning procedures and in vitro transcription and RNA transfection steps that are both time-consuming and inefficient. Several enteroviral cDNA clones with 5'-terminal T7 promoter and <span class="yellow">coxsackievirus A9</span> (<span class="blue">CAV9</span>) PCR product with the T7 promoter were transfected successfully into target cells expressing T7 RNA polymerase for the rescue of <span class="yellow">virus</span> particles. This demonstrated the overall feasibility of the in vivo transcription method. Furthermore, a rapid method using high-fidelity DNA polymerase, Phusion(TM), for amplification and mutagenesis of <span class="blue">CAV9</span> cDNA was generated. <span class="yellow">A</span> long PCR method was employed together with mutagenic primers for direct introduction of a unique restriction enzyme site into the VP1-2A junction of the <span class="blue">CAV9</span> cDNA clone during the PCR amplification process. Enhanced green fluorescent protein was subcloned to that site, and <span class="blue">CAV9</span>-eGFP cDNA was transfected to the target cells for in vivo transcription and successful rescue of <span class="blue">CAV9</span>-eGFP particles. The method allowed a straightforward mutagenesis and in vivo production of infectious enteroviral particles, and may be applicable routinely for rapid production of the modified picornaviruses over the use of the traditional subcloning protocols.
