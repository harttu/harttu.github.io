<h2>Njinella prolifera</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21398102</h3>Genetic diversity and phylogenetic position of the subclass Astomatia (Ciliophora) based on a sampling of six genera from West African oligochaetes (Glossoscolecidae, Megascolecidae), including description of the new genus Paraclausilocola n. gen. <br><br>To more confidently assess phylogenetic relationships among astome ciliates, we obtained small subunit (SSU) rRNA sequences from nine species distributed in six genera and three families: <span class="yellow">Almophrya bivacuolata</span>, <span class="yellow">Eudrilophrya complanata</span>, Metaracoelophrya sp. 1, Metaracoelophrya sp. 2, <span class="yellow">Metaracoelophrya intermedia</span>, Metaradiophrya sp., <span class="blue">Njinella prolifera</span>, <span class="yellow">Paraclausilocola constricta n. gen., n. sp.</span>, and <span class="yellow">Paraclausilocola elongata n. sp.</span> The two new species in the proposed new clausilocolid genus Paraclausilocola n. gen. are astomes with no attachment apparatus, two files of contractile vacuoles, and an arc-like anterior suture that has differentiations of thigmotactic ciliature on the anterior ends of the left kineties of the upper surface. Phylogenetic analyses were undertaken using neighbor-joining, Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood, and maximum parsimony. The nine species of astomes formed a strongly supported clade, showing the subclass Astomatia to be monophyletic and a weakly supported sister clade to the scuticociliates. There were two strongly supported clades within the astomes. However, genera assigned to the same family were found in different clades, and genera assigned to the same order were found in both clades. Thus, astome taxa appear to be paraphyletic when morphology is used to assign species to genera.
