<h2>RSV</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20980510</h3>Assembly and immunological properties of <span class="annotated ">Newcastle disease virus</span>-like particles containing the <span class="annotated ">respiratory syncytial virus</span> F and G proteins. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Human respiratory syncytial virus</span> (<span class="match annotated ">RSV</span>) is a serious respiratory pathogen in <span class="linneaus_only ">infants</span> and young <span class="linneaus_only ">children</span> as well as elderly and immunocompromised populations. However, no <span class="match annotated ">RSV</span> vaccines are available. We have explored the potential of virus-like particles (VLPs) as an <span class="match annotated ">RSV</span> vaccine candidate. VLPs composed entirely of <span class="match annotated ">RSV</span> proteins were produced at levels inadequate for their preparation as immunogens. However, VLPs composed of the <span class="annotated ">Newcastle disease virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">NDV</span>) nucleocapsid and membrane proteins and chimera proteins containing the ectodomains of <span class="match annotated ">RSV</span> F and G proteins fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of <span class="annotated ">NDV</span> F and HN proteins, respectively, were quantitatively prepared from avian cells. Immunization of <span class="annotated ">mice</span> with these VLPs, without adjuvant, stimulated robust, anti-<span class="match annotated ">RSV</span> F and G protein antibody responses. IgG2a/IgG1 ratios were very high, suggesting predominantly T(H)1 responses. In contrast to infectious <span class="match annotated ">RSV</span> immunization, neutralization antibody titers were robust and stable for 4 months. Immunization with a single dose of VLPs resulted in the complete protection of <span class="annotated ">mice</span> from <span class="match annotated ">RSV</span> replication in lungs. Upon <span class="match annotated ">RSV</span> intranasal challenge of VLP-immunized <span class="annotated ">mice</span>, no enhanced lung pathology was observed, in contrast to the pathology observed in <span class="annotated ">mice</span> immunized with formalin-inactivated <span class="match annotated ">RSV</span>. These results suggest that these VLPs are effective <span class="match annotated ">RSV</span> vaccines in <span class="annotated ">mice</span>, in contrast to other nonreplicating <span class="match annotated ">RSV</span> vaccine candidates.
