<h2>BChV</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20933015</h3>Detection and discrimination of members of the family Luteoviridae by real-time PCR and SYBR(R) GreenER(TM) melting curve analysis. <br><br>This study investigated the suitability of a two step real-time RT-PCR melting curve analysis as a tool for the detection and discrimination of nine species in the plant <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> family Luteoviridae, being <span class="annotated ">Soybean dwarf virus</span> [<span class="annotated ">SbDV</span>], <span class="annotated ">Bean leafroll virus</span> [<span class="annotated ">BLRV</span>], <span class="annotated ">Beet chlorosis virus</span> [<span class="match annotated ">BChV</span>], <span class="annotated ">Beet mild yellowing virus</span> [<span class="annotated ">BMYV</span>], <span class="annotated ">Beet western yellows virus</span> [<span class="annotated ">BWYV</span>], <span class="annotated ">Cereal yellow dwarf virus-RPV</span> [<span class="annotated ">CYDV-RPV</span>], <span class="annotated ">Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus</span> [<span class="annotated ">CABYV</span>], <span class="annotated ">Potato leafroll virus</span> [<span class="annotated ">PLRV</span>] and <span class="annotated ">Turnip yellows virus</span> [<span class="annotated ">TuYV</span>]. Melting temperature and shape of the melting peak were analysed for 68 bp and 148 bp coat protein gene amplicons using SYBR(R) GreenER(TM) fluorescent dye. Specific melting peaks with unique melting temperature were observed for the various species of the family Luteoviridae using the 68 bp amplicon, but not with the 148 bp amplicon. Due to the high variability of sequences for some members of this family, different melting temperatures were also observed between different isolates of the species <span class="annotated ">CYDV-RPV</span> and <span class="annotated ">TuYV</span>. Nevertheless, discrimination between species was achieved for <span class="annotated ">SbDV</span>, <span class="annotated ">BLRV</span>, <span class="match annotated ">BChV</span>, <span class="annotated ">BMYV</span>, <span class="annotated ">CABYV</span> and either <span class="annotated ">PLRV</span> or <span class="annotated ">BWYV</span>. Melting curve analysis, in this study, is a faster and more discriminatory alternative to gel electrophoresis of end-point PCR products for the detection of Luteoviridae infection.
