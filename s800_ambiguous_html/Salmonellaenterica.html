<h2>Salmonella enterica</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21037010</h3>Inactivation of the RluD pseudouridine synthase has minimal effects on growth and ribosome function in wild-type <span class="annotated ">Escherichia coli</span> and <span class="match annotated ">Salmonella enterica</span>. <br><br>The <span class="annotated ">Escherichia coli</span> rluD gene encodes a pseudouridine synthase responsible for the pseudouridine (Psi) modifications at positions 1911, 1915, and 1917 in helix 69 of 23S rRNA. It has been reported that deletion of rluD in <span class="annotated ">K-12 strains of E. coli</span> is associated with extremely slow growth, increased readthrough of stop codons, and defects in 50S ribosomal subunit assembly and 30S-50S subunit association. Suppressor mutations in the prfB and prfC genes encoding release factor 2 (RF2) and RF3 that restore the wild type-growth rate and also correct the ribosomal defects have now been isolated. These suppressors link helix 69 Psi residues with the termination phase of protein synthesis. However, further genetic analysis reported here also reveals that the slow growth and other defects associated with inactivation of rluD in <span class="annotated ">E. coli K-12</span> strains are due to a defective RF2 protein, with a threonine at position 246, which is present in all <span class="annotated ">K-12</span> strains. This is in contrast to the more typical alanine found at this position in most bacterial RF2s, including those of other <span class="annotated ">E. coli</span> strains. Inactivation of rluD in <span class="annotated ">E. coli</span> strains containing the prfB allele from <span class="annotated ">E. coli B</span> or in <span class="match annotated ">Salmonella enterica</span>, both carrying an RF2 with Ala246, has negligible effects on growth, termination, or ribosome function. The results indicate that, in contrast to those in wild bacteria, termination functions in <span class="annotated ">E. coli K-12</span> strains carrying a partially defective RF2 protein are especially susceptible to perturbation of ribosome-RF interactions, such as that caused by loss of h69 Psi modifications. 
<h3>21075923</h3>Fur negatively regulates hns and is required for the expression of HilA and virulence in <span class="match annotated ">Salmonella enterica</span><span class="unannotated ">Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium</span>. <br><br>Iron is an essential element for the survival of living cells. However, excess iron is toxic, and its uptake is exquisitely regulated by the ferric uptake regulator, Fur. In Salmonella, the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) encodes a type three secretion system, which is required for invasion of host epithelial cells in the small intestine. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> major activator of SPI-1 is HilA, which is encoded within SPI-1. One known regulator of hilA is Fur. The mechanism of hilA regulation by Fur is unknown. We report here that Fur is required for virulence in <span class="match annotated ">Salmonella enterica</span><span class="unannotated ">Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium</span> and that Fur is required for the activation of hilA, as well as of other HilA-dependent genes, invF and sipC. The Fur-dependent regulation of hilA was independent of PhoP, a known repressor of hilA. Instead, the expression of the gene coding for the histone-like protein, hns, was significantly derepressed in the fur mutant. Indeed, the activation of hilA by Fur was dependent on 28 nucleotides located upstream of hns. Moreover, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation to show that Fur bound, in vivo, to the upstream region of hns in a metal-dependent fashion. Finally, deletion of fur in an hns mutant resulted in Fur-independent activation of hilA. In conclusion, Fur activates hilA by repressing the expression of hns. 
<h3>21148731</h3>FAD binding by ApbE protein from <span class="match annotated ">Salmonella enterica</span>: a new class of FAD-binding proteins. <br><br>The periplasmic protein ApbE was identified through the analysis of several mutants defective in thiamine biosynthesis and was implicated as having a role in iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis or repair. While mutations in apbE cause decreased activity of several iron-sulfur enzymes in vivo, the specific role of ApbE remains unknown. Members of the AbpE family include NosX and RnfF, which have been implicated in oxidation-reduction associated with nitrous oxide and nitrogen metabolism, respectively. In this work, we show that ApbE binds one FAD molecule per monomeric unit. The structure of ApbE in the presence of bound FAD reveals a new FAD-binding motif. Protein variants that are nonfunctional in vivo were generated by random and targeted mutagenesis. Each variant was substituted in the environment of the FAD and analyzed for FAD binding after reconstitution. The variant that altered a key tyrosine residue involved in FAD binding prevented reconstitution of the protein.
