<h2>tomato plants</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20173013</h3>Streptomyces lacticiproducens sp. nov., a lactic acid-producing streptomycete isolated from the rhizosphere of <span class="yellow">tomato</span><span class="red">tomato plants</span>. <br><br>A novel actinomycete, designated strain GIMN4.001(T), was isolated from the rhizosphere of <span class="yellow">tomato</span><span class="red">tomato plants</span> grown in Guangzhou, China. The strain produced greyish white aerial mycelia, lactic acid and a large quantity of double diamond-shaped crystals on <span class="yellow">potato</span> dextrose agar and <span class="yellow">yeast</span> extract-malt extract agar. The colour of the substrate mycelium was not sensitive to pH. Microscopic observations revealed that strain GIMN4.001(T) produced verticillate chains of cylindrical spores. Chemotaxonomic data confirmed that strain GIMN4.001(T) belonged to the genus Streptomyces. Melanin pigments were not produced. No antibacterial activity was observed against <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span>, <span class="yellow">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>, <span class="yellow">Bacillus subtilis</span> or <span class="yellow">Candida albicans</span>, but inhibitory activity was observed against <span class="yellow">Penicillium citrinum</span>. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain GIMN4.001(T) was related most closely to <span class="yellow">Streptomyces morookaense</span> <span class="yellow">ATCC 19166(T)</span> (98.9 % similarity) and <span class="yellow">Streptomyces lavenduligriseus</span> <span class="yellow">ATCC 13306(T)</span> (98.7 %). Levels of DNA-DNA relatedness between strain GIMN4.001(T) and the type strains of these species were low (14-20 %). Furthermore, strain GIMN4.001(T) could be differentiated from <span class="yellow">S. morookaense</span>, S. lavenduligriseus and other closely related species of the genus Streptomyces based on morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics. On the basis of its physiological and molecular properties, strain GIMN4.001(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces lacticiproducens sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is GIMN4.001(T) (=CCTCC M208214(T)=NRRL B-24800(T)). 
<h3>21241329</h3>The effect of competition from neighbours on stomatal conductance in <span class="yellow">lettuce</span> and <span class="yellow">tomato</span><span class="red">tomato plants</span>. <br><br>Competition decreased transpiration from young <span class="yellow">lettuce</span> plants after 2 days, before any reductions in leaf area became apparent, and stomatal conductance (g(s) ) of <span class="yellow">lettuce</span> and <span class="yellow">tomato</span><span class="red">tomato plants</span> was also reduced. Stomatal closure was not due to hydraulic signals or competition for nutrients, as soil water content, leaf water status and leaf nitrate concentrations were unaffected by neighbours. Competition-induced stomatal closure was absent in an abscisic acid (ABA)-deficient <span class="yellow">tomato</span> mutant, flacca, indicating a fundamental involvement of ABA. Although <span class="yellow">tomato</span> xylem sap ABA concentrations were unaffected by the presence of neighbours, ABA/pH-based stomatal modulation is still likely to underlie the response to competition, as soil and xylem sap alkalization was observed in competing plants. Competition also modulated leaf ethylene production, and treatment of <span class="yellow">lettuce</span> plants with an ethylene perception inhibitor (1-methylcyclopropene) diminished the difference in g(s) between single and competing plants grown in a controlled environment room, but increased it in plants grown in the greenhouse: ethylene altered the extent of the stomatal response to competition. Effects of competition on g(s) are discussed in terms of the detection of the absence of neighbours: increases in g(s) and carbon fixation may allow faster initial space occupancy within an emerging community/crop. 
<h3>21907298</h3><span class="yellow">Galleria mellonella</span> as model host for the trans-kingdom pathogen <span class="yellow">Fusarium oxysporum</span>. <br><br><span class="yellow">Fusarium oxysporum</span>, the causal agent of vascular wilt disease, affects a wide range of plant species and can produce disseminated infections in <span class="yellow">humans</span>. <span class="yellow">F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici isolate FGSC 9935</span> causes disease both on <span class="blue">tomato plants</span> and immunodepressed <span class="yellow">mice</span>, making it an ideal model for the comparative analysis of <span class="yellow">fungal</span> virulence on plant and animal hosts. Here we tested the ability of <span class="yellow">FGSC 9935</span> to cause disease in the <span class="yellow">greater wax moth</span> <span class="yellow">Galleria mellonella</span>, an invertebrate model host that is widely used for the study of microbial <span class="yellow">human</span> pathogens. Injection of living but not of heat-killed microconidia into the hemocoel of <span class="yellow">G. mellonella</span> larvae resulted in dose-dependent killing both at 30^0C and at 37^0C. Fluorescence microscopy of larvae inoculated with a <span class="yellow">F. oxysporum transformant</span> expressing GFP revealed hyphal proliferation within the hemocoel, interaction with <span class="yellow">G. mellonella</span> hemocytes, and colonization of the killed insects by the fungus. Fungal gene knockout mutants previously tested in the <span class="yellow">tomato</span> and immunodepressed <span class="yellow">mouse</span> systems displayed a good correlation in virulence between the Galleria and the <span class="yellow">mouse</span> model. Thus, Galleria represents a useful non-vertebrate infection model for studying virulence mechanisms of <span class="yellow">F. oxysporum</span> on animal hosts. 
<h3>22182623</h3>Interspecific Interactions Between <span class="yellow">Bemisia tabaci</span> Biotype B and <span class="yellow">Trialeurodes vaporariorum</span> (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae). <br><br><span class="yellow">Bemisia tabaci</span> (Gennadius) biotype B and <span class="yellow">Trialeurodes vaporariorum</span> (Westwood) are invasive whitefly species that often co-occur on greenhouse-grown vegetables in northern China. Although <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> biotype B has been present in China for a relatively short period of time, it has become dominant over <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span>. We studied the interspecific competitive interactions between the two species in single or mixed cultures at 24 +/- 1^0C, 40 +/- 5% RH, and L14:D10 h photoperiod. Female longevity on <span class="yellow">tomato</span> was not significantly different between species, but <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> reproduced 4.3 to 4.9 fold more progeny. The ratio of female to male progeny in both instances was greater for <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span>. When cultured on <span class="yellow">tomato</span>, <span class="yellow">cotton</span>, and <span class="yellow">tobacco</span>, <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> developed 0.8, 3.3, and 4.7 d earlier in single culture, and 1.8, 3.9, and 4.3 d earlier in mixed culture. <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> displaced <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span> in four, five and six generations when the initial ratios of <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> to <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span> were 15:15, 20:10, or 10:20 on <span class="yellow">tomato</span>. Populations of <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> were 2.3 fold higher than that of <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span> on <span class="yellow">tomato</span><span class="red">tomato plants</span> for seven consecutive generations in single culture. <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> performed better in development, survival, fecundity, and female ratio. We conclude that <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> could displace <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span> in as short as four generations in a controlled greenhouse environment when they start at equal proportions. Warmer greenhouse conditions and an increase in total greenhouse area could be contributing factors in the recent dominance of <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span>.
