<h2>newman</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21131496</h3><span class="yellow">Staphylococcus aureus</span> ClpC divergently regulates capsule via sae and codY in strain <span class="blue">newman</span> but activates capsule via codY in strain <span class="yellow">UAMS-1</span> and in strain <span class="yellow">Newman</span> with repaired saeS. <br><br>ClpC is an ATPase chaperone found in most Gram-positive low-GC bacteria. It has been recently reported that ClpC affected virulence gene expression in <span class="yellow">Staphylococcus aureus</span>. Here we report that ClpC regulates transcription of the cap operon and accumulation of capsule, a major virulence factor for <span class="yellow">S. aureus</span>. As virulence genes are regulated by a complex regulatory network in <span class="yellow">S. aureus</span>, we have used capsule as a model to understand this regulation. By microarray analyses of strain <span class="yellow">Newman</span>, we found that ClpC strongly activates transcription of the sae operon, whose products are known to negatively regulate capsule synthesis in this strain. Further studies indicated that ClpC repressed capsule production by activating the sae operon in strain <span class="yellow">Newman</span>. Interestingly, the clpC gene cloned into a multiple-copy plasmid vector exhibited an activation phenotype, suggesting that ClpC overexpression has a net positive effect. In the absence of sae function, by either deletion or correction of a native mutation within saeS, we found that ClpC had a positive effect on capsule production. Indeed, in the <span class="yellow">UAMS-1</span> strain, which does not have the saeS mutation, ClpC functioned as an activator of capsule production. Our microarray analyses of strain <span class="yellow">Newman</span> also revealed that CodY, a repressor of capsule production, was repressed by ClpC. Using genetic approaches, we showed that CodY functioned downstream of ClpC, leading to capsule activation both in <span class="yellow">Newman</span> and in <span class="yellow">UAMS-1</span>. Thus, ClpC functions in two opposite pathways in capsule regulation in strain <span class="yellow">Newman</span> but functions as a positive activator in strain <span class="yellow">UAMS-1</span>.
