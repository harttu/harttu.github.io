<h2>FGSC</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21601644</h3>Analysis of the <span class="yellow">Fusarium graminearum species complex</span> from <span class="yellow">wheat</span>, <span class="yellow">barley</span> and <span class="yellow">maize</span> in South Africa provides evidence of species-specific differences in host preference. 

Species identity and trichothecene toxin potential of 560 members of the <span class="yellow">Fusarium graminearum species complex</span> (<span class="blue">FGSC</span>) collected from diseased <span class="yellow">wheat</span>, <span class="yellow">barley</span> and <span class="yellow">maize</span> in South Africa was determined using a microsphere-based multilocus genotyping assay. Although three trichothecene types (3-ADON, 15-ADON and NIV) were represented among these isolates, strains with the 15-ADON type predominated on all three hosts. <span class="yellow">A</span> significant difference, however, was identified in the composition of <span class="blue">FGSC</span> pathogens associated with Gibberella ear rot (GER) of <span class="yellow">maize</span> as compared to Fusarium head blight (FHB) of <span class="yellow">wheat</span> or <span class="yellow">barley</span> (P&lt;0.001). <span class="yellow">F. graminearum</span> accounted for more than 85% of the <span class="blue">FGSC</span> isolates associated with FHB of <span class="yellow">wheat</span> and <span class="yellow">barley</span> (N=425), and was also the dominant species among isolates from <span class="yellow">maize</span> roots (N=35). However, with the exception of a single isolate identified as an interspecific hybrid between <span class="yellow">Fusariumboothii</span> and <span class="yellow">F. graminearum</span>, GER of <span class="yellow">maize</span> (N=100) was exclusively associated with <span class="yellow">F. boothii</span>. The predominance of <span class="yellow">F. graminearum</span> among FHB isolates, and the near exclusivity of <span class="yellow">F. boothii</span> among GER isolates, was observed across all cultivars, collection dates, and provinces sampled. Because these results suggest a difference in host preference among species of the <span class="blue">FGSC</span>, we hypothesize that <span class="yellow">F. graminearum</span> may be less well adapted to infect <span class="yellow">maize</span> ears than other members of the <span class="blue">FGSC</span>. 
<h3>22004876</h3>Novel Fusarium head blight pathogens from Nepal and Louisiana revealed by multilocus genealogical concordance. 

This study was conducted to assess evolutionary relationships, species diversity and trichothecene toxin potential of five <span class="yellow">Fusarium graminearum complex</span> (<span class="blue">FGSC</span>) isolates identified as genetically novel during prior Fusarium head blight (FHB) surveys in Nepal and Louisiana. Results of a multilocus genotyping (MLGT) assay for B-trichothecene species determination indicated these isolates might represent novel species within the <span class="blue">FGSC</span>. GCPSR-based phylogenetic analyses of a 12-gene dataset, comprising portions of seven loci totaling 13.1kb of aligned DNA sequence data, provided strong support for the genealogical exclusivity of the Nepalese and Louisianan isolates. Accordingly, both species are formally recognized herein as novel <span class="yellow">FGSC species</span>. <span class="yellow">Fusarium nepalense</span> was resolved as the sister lineage of <span class="yellow">Fusarium ussurianum+Fusarium asiaticum</span> within an Asian subclade of the <span class="blue">FGSC</span>. <span class="yellow">Fusarium louisianense</span> was strongly supported as a reciprocally monophyletic sister of <span class="yellow">Fusarium gerlachii+F. graminearum</span>, suggesting that this subclade might be endemic to North America. Multilocus Bayesian species tree analyses augment these results and provide evidence for a distinct lineage within <span class="yellow">F. graminearum</span> predominately from the Gulf Coast of Louisiana. As predicted by the MLGT assay, mycotoxin analyses demonstrated that <span class="yellow">F. nepalense</span> and <span class="yellow">F. louisianense</span> could produce 15ADON and nivalenol, respectively, in planta. In addition, both species were only able to induce mild FHB symptoms on <span class="yellow">wheat</span> in pathogenicity experiments.
