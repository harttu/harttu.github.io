<h2>Nocardioides dokdonensis FR1436</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20173009</h3><span class="annotated ">Nocardioides caricicola sp. nov.</span>, an endophytic bacterium isolated from a halophyte, <span class="annotated ">Carex scabrifolia</span> Steud. <br><br>A Gram-staining-positive, coccoid to rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain <span class="annotated ">YC6903</span>(T), was isolated from a halophytic plant (<span class="annotated ">Carex scabrifolia</span> Steud.) collected from sand dunes at Namhae Island, Korea, and its taxonomic position was investigated by using a polyphasic approach. Strain <span class="annotated ">YC6903</span>(T) grew optimally at 30 ^0C and at pH 8.0. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain <span class="annotated ">YC6903</span>(T) belongs to the genus Nocardioides in the family Nocardioidaceae. Strain <span class="annotated ">YC6903</span>(T) was related most closely to <span class="annotated ">Nocardioides pyridinolyticus OS4</span>(T) (97.0 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), <span class="match annotated ">Nocardioides dokdonensis FR1436</span>(T) (96.6 %), <span class="annotated ">Nocardioides aquiterrae GW-9</span>(T) (96.6 %) and <span class="annotated ">Nocardioides hankookensis DS-30</span>(T) (96.6 %). The cell-wall peptidoglycan contained LL-diaminopimelic acid and MK-8(H(4)) was the major respiratory quinone. The mean (+/-SD) level of DNA-DNA relatedness between strain <span class="annotated ">YC6903</span>(T) and <span class="annotated ">N. pyridinolyticus OS4</span>(T) was 53.5+/-5.5 %. The predominant cellular fatty acid of strain <span class="annotated ">YC6903</span>(T) was iso-C(16 : 0) (28.9 %). The DNA G+C content was 71.7 mol%. Phenotypic, phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic data indicated that strain <span class="annotated ">YC6903</span>(T) represents a novel species of the genus Nocardioides, for which the name <span class="annotated ">Nocardioides caricicola sp. nov.</span> is proposed. The type strain is <span class="annotated ">YC6903</span>(T) (=KACC 13778(T) =DSM 22177(T)).
