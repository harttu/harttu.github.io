<h2>cassava</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20923689</h3>Simultaneous virus-specific detection of the two <span class="blue">cassava</span> brown streak-associated viruses by RT-PCR reveals wide distribution in East Africa, mixed infections, and infections in <span class="yellow">Manihot glaziovii</span>. <br><br>The expanding <span class="blue">cassava</span> brown streak disease (CBSD) epidemic in East Africa is caused by two ipomoviruses (genus Ipomovirus; Potyviridae), namely, <span class="yellow">Cassava brown streak virus</span> (<span class="yellow">CBSV</span>), and <span class="yellow">Ugandan cassava brown streak virus</span> (<span class="yellow">UCBSV</span>) that was described recently. <span class="yellow">A</span> reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based diagnostic method was developed in this study for simultaneous virus-specific detection of the two viruses. Results showed that <span class="yellow">CBSV</span> and <span class="yellow">UCBSV</span> are distributed widely in the highlands (> 1000 m above the sea level) of the Lake Victoria zone in Uganda and Tanzania and also in the Indian Ocean costal lowlands of Tanzania. Isolates of <span class="yellow">UCBSV</span> from the Lake Victoria zone were placed to two phylogenetic clusters in accordance with their origin in Uganda or Tanzania, respectively. Mixed infections with <span class="yellow">CBSV</span> and <span class="yellow">UCBSV</span> were detected in many <span class="blue">cassava</span> plants in the areas surveyed. <span class="yellow">CBSV</span> was also detected in the perennial species <span class="yellow">Manihot glaziovii</span> (DNA-barcoded in this study) in Tanzania, which revealed the first <span class="yellow">virus</span> reservoir other than <span class="blue">cassava</span>. The method for detection of <span class="yellow">CBSV</span> and <span class="yellow">UCBSV</span> described in this study has important applications for plant quarantine, resistance breeding of <span class="blue">cassava</span>, and studies on epidemiology and control of CBSD in East Africa. 
<h3>21526935</h3>Assessment of attractiveness of <span class="blue">cassava</span> as a roosting plant for the <span class="yellow">melon fly</span>, <span class="yellow">Bactrocera cucurbitae</span>, and the <span class="yellow">Oriental fruit fly</span>, <span class="yellow">B. dorsalis</span>. <br><br>Application of bait spray to crop borders is a standard approach for suppression of <span class="yellow">melon fly</span>, <span class="yellow">Bactrocera cucurbitae</span> (Coquillett) (Diptera: Tephritidae) populations and may also be of value for suppression of <span class="yellow">oriental fruit fly</span>, <span class="yellow">B. dorsalis</span> (Hendel) populations. Establishment of preferred roosting hosts as crop borders may help to improve suppression of both fruit fly species by providing sites for bait spray applications. In an area-wide <span class="yellow">B. cucurbitae</span> suppression trial, the question was raised as to whether <span class="blue">cassava</span>, <span class="yellow">Manihot esculenta</span> Crantz (Euphorbiales: Euphorbiaceae), could be used as a <span class="yellow">B. cucurbitae</span> roosting host. <span class="yellow">M. esculenta</span> was of interest as a roosting host because, in contrast to many other identified preferred roosting hosts, it would also be a crop potentially increasing the productivity of the crop production system overall. As a short-lived and shrubby perennial, <span class="yellow">M. esculenta</span> potentially constitutes a crop with more persistent roosting foliage than an annual crop such as <span class="yellow">corn</span>, <span class="yellow">Zea mays</span> L. (Cyperales: Poaceae), that has often been planted as a roosting host for <span class="yellow">B. cucurbitae</span> control. Using protein-baited traps set amidst potted plants placed adjacent to a <span class="yellow">papaya</span> <span class="yellow">Carica papaya</span> L. (Violales: Caricaceae) orchard known to have established populations of <span class="yellow">B. cucurbitae</span> and <span class="yellow">B. dorsalis</span>, the effectiveness of <span class="yellow">M. esculenta</span> as a roosting host was assessed by comparing its attractiveness to that of <span class="yellow">castor bean</span>, <span class="yellow">Ricinus communis</span> L (Malpighiales: Euphorbiaceae), previously identified as one of the most attractive roosting hosts for <span class="yellow">B. cucurbitae</span>, and to <span class="yellow">corn</span>, a crop which has been planted as a roosting host for help in <span class="yellow">B. cucurbitae</span> control. The results showed that use of <span class="yellow">M. esculenta</span> as a roosting host is comparable to use of <span class="yellow">R. communis</span> by both <span class="yellow">B. cucurbitae</span> and <span class="yellow">B. dorsalis</span>. These results provide encouragement to incorporate <span class="yellow">M. esculenta</span> on a farm as a trap crop (i.e. site for bait spray application). This has the advantage of having the trap crop be a crop on its own (as opposed to <span class="yellow">castor bean</span>) and, among prospective crops that could be used as a trap crop, has foliage more persistent than an annual trap crop such as <span class="yellow">corn</span>.
