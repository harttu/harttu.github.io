DNA barcoding using the mitochondrial cytochromecoxidase subunit I (cox-1) gene has recently gained popularity as a tool for species identification of a variety of taxa. The primary objective of our research was to explore the efficacy of using cox-1 barcoding for species identification within the genus Tetrahymena. We first increased intraspecific sampling for <span class="yellow">Tetrahymena canadensis</span>, <span class="yellow">Tetrahymena hegewischi</span>, <span class="blue">Tetrahymena pyriformis</span>, <span class="yellow">Tetrahymena rostrata</span>, <span class="yellow">Tetrahymena thermophila</span>, and <span class="yellow">Tetrahymena tropicalis</span>. Increased sampling efforts show that intraspecific sequence divergence is typically less than 1%, though it may be more in some species. The barcoding also showed that some strains might be misidentified or mislabeled. We also used cox-1 barcodes to provide species identifications for 51 unidentified environmental isolates, with a success rate of 98%. Thus, cox-1 barcoding is an invaluable tool for protistologists, especially when used in conjunction with morphological studies.
