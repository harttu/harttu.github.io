</br>
The production of avian <b>influenza virus</b> by BHK21 , Vero and MDCK - SFS cell lines was compared . 
</br>
Taken together with their suitability for suspension growth this makes the MDCK - SFS cell line potentially useful for large scale <b>influenza virus</b> production . 
</br>
Successful vaccination strategies that protect aged SB__mice from lethal challenge from <b>influenza virus</b> and heterologous SB__severe SI__acute SI__respiratory SI__syndrome SI__coronavirus . 
</br>
The newly emerging SB__severe SI__acute SI__respiratory SI__syndrome SI__coronavirus ( SB__SARS SI__- SI__CoV ) and reemerging <b>influenza virus</b> cause disproportionate disease in the aged , who are also notoriously difficult to successfully vaccinate , likely due to immunosenescence . 
</br>
The superior protection for the aged observed with VRP ( 3000 ) - based vaccines was confirmed in a lethal <b>influenza virus</b> challenge model . 
</br>
Exploration into the mechanism ( s ) of successful vaccination in the immunosenescent should aid in the development of successful vaccine strategies for other viral diseases disproportionately affecting the elderly , like SB__West SI__Nile SI__virus , <b>influenza virus</b> , norovirus , or other emerging viruses of the future . 
</br>
T - cell cross - reactivity between SB__HCV and <b>influenza virus</b> - specific epitopes has been associated with rapid progression of SB__HCV disease ( S . Urbani , B . Amadei , P . Fisicaro , M . Pilli , G . Missale , A . Bertoletti , and C . Ferrari , J . Exp . Med . 201 : 675 - 680 , 2005 ) .
