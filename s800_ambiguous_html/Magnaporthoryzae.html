<h2>Magnaporth oryzae</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21241815</h3>Genetic and molecular characterization of a blue light photoreceptor MGWC-1 in <span class="blue">Magnaporth oryzae</span>. <br><br>Three key factors involved in successful plant disease development include the presence of a susceptible host, a virulent pathogen, and a disease-conducive environment. Our understanding of how environmental factors influence disease-conducive or disease-suppressive conditions, and how a pathogen advantageously capitalizes on them, is quite limited. Utilizing the model pathosystem <span class="yellow">Magnaporthe oryzae</span>-<span class="yellow">Oryza sativa</span>, we found a significant light-dependent disease suppression. Our genetic data suggest that the blue-light receptor MGWC-1 in <span class="yellow">M. oryzae</span> is involved in light-dependent disease suppression during the dark-phase (disease-conducive light condition) immediately after pathogen-host contact. Sensing &quot;darkness&quot; is accomplished by MGWC-1, a blue-light receptor in <span class="yellow">M. oryzae</span>. To explore the potential molecular mechanisms of light-dependent disease suppression we performed a genome-wide microarray experiment and identified several groups of gene families that are differentially regulated during the light-to-dark transition. Our genetic and molecular data provide insights into how a <span class="yellow">fungal</span> pathogen utilizes ambient light signals for successful disease development.
