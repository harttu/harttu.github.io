<h2>C. protea</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21112814</h3>&quot;Slime molds&quot; among the Tubulinea (Amoebozoa): molecular systematics and taxonomy of Copromyxa. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Copromyxa protea</span> is a dung-inhabiting amoeboid organism that aggregates to form simple macroscopic fruiting structures, sorocarps, which are composed of a single cell type. In a recent effort to find the phylogenetic positions of the less well-known sorocarpic protists considered to be &quot;cellular slime molds,&quot; or aggregatively fruiting amoebae, we isolated <span class="match annotated ">C. protea</span> and sequenced the nuclear-encoded small subunit ribosomal RNA gene from four samples collected from <span class="annotated ">cattle</span> farms in the central USA. Phylogenetic analyses of these data place <span class="match annotated ">C. protea</span> in the eukaryotic supergroup Amoebozoa together with the Tubulinea, in which there has been no previous report of an aggregative fruiting habit. This is consistent with the morphology of the trophozoites. In fact, <span class="annotated ">Copromyxa protea</span> is found to be very closely related to <span class="annotated ">Hartmannella cantabrigiensis</span> and to a since lost amoeba isolate, <span class="annotated ">Hartmannella sp. 4/3Da/10</span>. This new grouping of Copromyxa+<span class="annotated ">H. cantabrigiensis</span> is sister to Glaeseria, which together are sister to the Amoebidae (Amoeba+Chaos). We suggest renaming, <span class="unannotated ">H. cantabrigiensis</span> as <span class="annotated ">C. cantabrigiensis</span> and designate isolate 4/3Da/10 as <span class="match annotated ">C. protea</span>. Future work is needed to see if these newly assigned members of the genus Copromyxa also show evidence of an ability to fruit.
