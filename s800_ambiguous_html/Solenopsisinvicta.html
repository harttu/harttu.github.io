<h2>Solenopsis invicta</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21529150</h3>The organization of foraging in the <span class="yellow">fire ant</span>, <span class="blue">Solenopsis invicta</span>. 

Although natural selection in ants acts most strongly at the colony, or superorganismal level, foraging patterns have rarely been studied at that level, focusing instead on the behavior of individual foragers or groups of foragers. The experiments and observations in this paper reveal in broad strokes how colonies of the <span class="yellow">fire ant</span>, <span class="blue">Solenopsis invicta</span><span class="yellow">Solenopsis invicta Buren</span> (<span class="yellow">Hymenoptera</span>: Formicidae), allocate their available labor to foraging, how they disperse that force within their territory, and how this force changes with colony size, season and worker age. Territory area is positively related to colony size and the number of foragers, more so during the spring than fall. Changes of colony size and territory area are driven by seasonal variation of sexual and worker production, which in turn drive seasonal variation of worker age-distribution. During spring sexual production, colonies shrink because worker production falls below replacement. This loss is proportional to colony size, causing forager density in the spring to be negatively related to colony and territory size. In the fall, colonies emphasize worker production, bringing colony size back up. However, because smaller colonies curtailed spring worker production less than larger ones, their fall forager populations are proportionally greater, causing them to gain territory at the expense of large colonies. Much variation of territory area remains unexplained and can probably be attributed to pressure from neighboring colonies. Boundaries between territories are characterized by &quot;no ants' zones&quot; mostly devoid of <span class="yellow">fire ants</span>. The forager population can be divided into a younger group of recruitable workers that wait for scouts to activate them to help retrieve large food finds. About one-third of the recruits wait near openings in the foraging tunnels that underlie the entire territory, while two-thirds wait in the nest. Recruitment to food is initially very rapid and local from the foraging tunnels, while sustained recruitment gradually involves the recruits waiting in the nest. As recruits age, they become scouts searching for food on the surface, and die about two weeks later. Foraging tunnels decrease in cross-sectional area with distance from the nest, in keeping with the gradual bleeding off of workers to the surface with distance. Foragers lack route-faithfulness, and having been marked and released at one point within the territory, they can be recaptured at any other point a day later. The size of the territory actually occupied may be limited during dry weather, resulting in very large no-ants' zones. 
<h3>21797944</h3>Insect insulin receptors: insights from sequence and caste expression analyses of two cloned hymenopteran insulin receptor cDNAs from the <span class="yellow">fire ant</span>. 

The insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signalling (IIS) pathway in the <span class="yellow">honey bee</span> (<span class="yellow">Apis mellifera</span>) is linked to reproductive division of labour and foraging behaviour. Two insulin receptor genes are present in the released genomes of other social hymenopterans. Limited information is available on the IIS pathway role in ants. The predicted insulin receptor sequences from the recently released draft genome of the <span class="yellow">fire ant</span> <span class="blue">Solenopsis invicta</span> (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) are incomplete and biologically significant data are also lacking. To elucidate the role of the IIS pathway in the <span class="yellow">fire ant</span>, two putative insulin receptors (SiInR-1 and SiInR-2) were cloned; the first InR cDNAs cloned from social insects. Analyses of putative post-translational modification sites in SiInRs revealed the potential for differential regulation. We investigated the transcriptional expression of both receptors at different developmental stages, castes and queen tissues. In last instar larvae and pharate pupae of workers and reproductive, transcriptional abundance of both receptors was negatively correlated with body size and nutritional status. The expression level of both receptors in different queen tissues appears to correlate with requirements for queen reproductive physiology and behaviours. This study contributes new information to the understanding of social insects because in <span class="yellow">fire ants</span> juvenile hormone acts as a gonadotropin and workers are fully sterile, contrary to <span class="yellow">honey bees</span>. 
<h3>21526927</h3>Wolbachia <span class="yellow">wSinvictaA</span> infections in natural populations of the <span class="yellow">fire ant</span> <span class="blue">Solenopsis invicta</span>: testing for phenotypic effects. 

Wolbachia are intracellular bacteria that commonly infect many arthropods and some nematodes. In arthropods, these maternally transmitted bacteria often induce a variety of phenotypic effects to enhance their own spread within host populations. Wolbachia phenotypic effects generally either provide benefits to infected host females (cytoplasmic incompatibility, positive fitness effects) or bias host sex ratio in favor of females (male-killing, parthenogenesis, feminization), all of which increase the relative production of infected females in host populations. Wolbachia surveys have found infections to be exceedingly common in ants, but little is known at this juncture as to what phenotypic effects, if any, they induce in this group. Previous studies have demonstrated that individuals from native populations of the invasive <span class="yellow">fire ant</span> <span class="blue">Solenopsis invicta</span> commonly harbor one or more of three Wolbachia variants. One of the variants, <span class="yellow">wSinvictaA</span>, typically occurs at low prevalence in <span class="yellow">S. invicta</span> populations, appears to have been transmitted horizontally into <span class="yellow">S. invicta</span> three or more times, and has been lost repeatedly from host lineages over time. In order to determine the phenotypic effects and likely population dynamics of <span class="yellow">wSinvictaA</span> infections in these ants, brood production patterns of newly mated <span class="yellow">fire ant</span> queens were studied during simulated claustral founding and measured <span class="yellow">wSinvictaA</span> transmission fidelity within mature single-queen families. No clear evidence was found for Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility, significant fitness effects, or male-killing. Maternal transmission was perfect to both virgin queens and males. Possible mechanisms for how this variant could be maintained in host populations are discussed.
