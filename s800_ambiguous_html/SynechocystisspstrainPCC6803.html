<h2>Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21036997</h3>Distinct roles of multiple NDH-1 complexes in the cyanobacterial electron transport network as revealed by kinetic analysis of P700+ reduction in various Ndh-deficient mutants of <span class="blue">Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803</span>. <br><br>While methyl viologen had only a small effect on P700(+) rereduction kinetics after far-red pulses in KCN-treated wild-type <span class="blue">Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803</span> and an NdhF3/NdhF4 (NdhF3/F4)-defective mutant, it involved a rather slow P700(+) rereduction in an NdhF1-defective mutant. This strongly indicates that (i) active electron flow from metabolites to plastoquinone is suppressed upon deletion of ndhF1 and (ii) photosystem 1-mediated cyclic electron transport is dependent on NdhF3/F4-type NDH-1 complexes.
