<h2>Nicotiana benthamiana</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20854394</h3>SGT1 contributes to coronatine signaling and <span class="yellow">Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato</span> disease symptom development in <span class="yellow">tomato</span> and <span class="yellow">Arabidopsis</span>. 

* <span class="yellow">Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000</span> (<span class="yellow">Pst DC3000</span>) causes an economically important bacterial speck disease on <span class="yellow">tomato</span> and produces symptoms with necrotic lesions surrounded by chlorosis. The chlorosis is mainly attributed to a jasmonic acid (JA)-isoleucine analogue, coronatine (COR), produced by <span class="yellow">Pst DC3000</span>. However, the molecular processes underlying lesion development and COR-induced chlorosis are poorly understood. * In this study, we took advantage of a chlorotic phenotype elicited by COR on <span class="blue">Nicotiana benthamiana</span> leaves and virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) as a rapid reverse genetic screening tool and identified a role for SGT1 (suppressor of G2 allele of skp1) in COR-induced chlorosis. * Silencing of SGT1 in <span class="yellow">tomato</span> resulted in reduction of disease-associated symptoms (cell death and chlorosis), suggesting a molecular connection between COR-induced chlorosis and cell death. In <span class="yellow">Arabidopsis</span>, AtSGT1b but not AtSGT1a was required for COR responses, including root growth inhibition and <span class="yellow">Pst DC3000</span> symptom (water soaked lesion) development. Notably, overexpression of AtSGT1b did not alter <span class="yellow">Pst DC3000</span> symptoms or sensitivity to COR. * Taken together, our results demonstrate that SGT1/SGT1b is required for COR-induced chlorosis and subsequent necrotic disease development in <span class="yellow">tomato</span> and <span class="yellow">Arabidopsis</span>. SGT1 is therefore a component of the COR/JA-mediated signal transduction pathway. 
<h3>20962095</h3>Role of RNase MRP in <span class="yellow">viral</span> RNA degradation and RNA recombination.

RNA degradation, together with RNA synthesis, controls the steady-state level of <span class="yellow">viral</span> RNAs in infected cells. The endoribonucleolytic cleavage of <span class="yellow">viral</span> RNA is important not only for <span class="yellow">viral</span> RNA degradation but for RNA recombination as well, due to the participation of some RNA degradation products in the RNA recombination process. To identify host endoribonucleases involved in degradation of <span class="yellow">Tomato bushy stunt virus</span> (<span class="yellow">TBSV</span>) in a <span class="yellow">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> model host, we tested eight known endoribonucleases. Here we report that downregulation of SNM1, encoding a component of the RNase MRP, and a temperature-sensitive mutation in the NME1 gene, coding for the RNA component of RNase MRP, lead to reduced production of the endoribonucleolytically cleaved <span class="yellow">TBSV</span> RNA in <span class="yellow">yeast</span>. We also show that the highly purified <span class="yellow">yeast</span> RNase MRP cleaves the <span class="yellow">TBSV</span> RNA in vitro, resulting in <span class="yellow">TBSV</span> RNA degradation products similar in size to those observed in <span class="yellow">yeast</span> cells. Knocking down the NME1 homolog in <span class="blue">Nicotiana benthamiana</span> also led to decreased production of the cleaved <span class="yellow">TBSV</span> RNA, suggesting that in plants, RNase MRP is involved in <span class="yellow">TBSV</span> RNA degradation. Altogether, this work suggests a role for the host endoribonuclease RNase MRP in <span class="yellow">viral</span> RNA degradation and recombination. 
<h3>21062316</h3>Plasma membrane Ca^2+ transporters mediate virus-induced acquired resistance to oxidative stress. 

This paper reports the phenomenon of acquired cross-tolerance to oxidative stress in plants and investigates the activity of specific Ca^2+ transport systems mediating this phenomenon. <span class="blue">Nicotiana benthamiana</span> plants were infected with <span class="yellow">Potato virus X</span> (<span class="yellow">PVX</span>) and exposed to oxidative [either ultraviolet (UV-C) or H2O2] stress. Plant adaptive responses were assessed by the combined application of a range of electrophysiological (non-invasive microelectrode ion flux measurements), biochemical (Ca^2+- and H+-ATPase activity), imaging (fluorescence lifetime imaging measurements of changes in intracellular Ca^2+ concentrations), pharmacological and cytological transmission electrone microscopy techniques. Virus-infected plants had a better ability to control UV-induced elevations in cytosolic-free Ca^2+ and prevent structural and functional damage of chloroplasts. Taken together, our results suggest a high degree of crosstalk between UV and pathogen-induced oxidative stresses, and highlight the crucial role of Ca^2+ efflux systems in acquired resistance to oxidative stress in plants.
