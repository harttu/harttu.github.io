<h2>Mexican palo verde</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21521138</h3>Tortricid moths reared from the invasive weed <span class="blue">Mexican palo verde</span>, <span class="yellow">Parkinsonia aculeata</span>, with comments on their host specificity, biology, geographic distribution, and systematics. 

As part of efforts to identify native herbivores of <span class="blue">Mexican palo verde</span>, <span class="yellow">Parkinsonia aculeata</span> L. (Leguminosae: Caesalpinioideae), as potential biological control agents against this invasive weed in Australia, ten species of Tortricidae (Lepidoptera) were reared from Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Venezuela: Amorbia concavana (Zeller), Platynota rostrana (Walker), Platynota helianthes (Meyrick), <span class="yellow">Platynota stultana</span> Walsingham (all Tortricinae: Sparganothini), Rudenia leguminana (Busck), Cochylis sp. (both Tortricinae: Cochylini), Ofatulena duodecemstriata (Walsingham), <span class="yellow">O</span>. luminosa Heinrich, Ofatulena sp. (all Olethreutinae: Grapholitini), and Crocidosema lantana Busck (Olethreutinae: Eucosmini). Significant geographic range extensions are provided for <span class="yellow">O</span>. duodecemstriata and R. leguminana. These are the first documented records of <span class="yellow">P. aculeata</span> as a host plant for all but <span class="yellow">O</span>. luminosa. The four species of Sparganothini are polyphagous; in contrast, the two Cochylini and three Grapholitini likely are specialists on Leguminosae. Ofatulena luminosa is possibly host specific on <span class="yellow">P. aculeata</span>. Host trials with Rudenia leguminana also provide some evidence of specificity, in contrast to historical rearing records. To examine the possibility that R. leguminana is a complex of species, two data sets of molecular markers were examined: (1) a combined data set of two mitochondrial markers (a 781-basepair region of cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and a 685-basepair region of cytochrome c oxidase II) and one nuclear marker (a 531-basepair region of the 28S domain 2); and (2) the 650-basepair &quot;barcode&quot; region of COI. Analyses of both data sets strongly suggest that individuals examined in this study belong to more than one species.
