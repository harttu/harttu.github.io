<h2>Staphylococcus aureus</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21131496</h3><span class="blue">Staphylococcus aureus</span> ClpC divergently regulates capsule via sae and codY in strain <span class="yellow">newman</span> but activates capsule via codY in strain <span class="yellow">UAMS-1</span> and in strain <span class="yellow">Newman</span> with repaired saeS. <br><br>ClpC is an ATPase chaperone found in most Gram-positive low-GC bacteria. It has been recently reported that ClpC affected virulence gene expression in <span class="blue">Staphylococcus aureus</span>. Here we report that ClpC regulates transcription of the cap operon and accumulation of capsule, a major virulence factor for <span class="yellow">S. aureus</span>. As virulence genes are regulated by a complex regulatory network in <span class="yellow">S. aureus</span>, we have used capsule as a model to understand this regulation. By microarray analyses of strain <span class="yellow">Newman</span>, we found that ClpC strongly activates transcription of the sae operon, whose products are known to negatively regulate capsule synthesis in this strain. Further studies indicated that ClpC repressed capsule production by activating the sae operon in strain <span class="yellow">Newman</span>. Interestingly, the clpC gene cloned into a multiple-copy plasmid vector exhibited an activation phenotype, suggesting that ClpC overexpression has a net positive effect. In the absence of sae function, by either deletion or correction of a native mutation within saeS, we found that ClpC had a positive effect on capsule production. Indeed, in the <span class="yellow">UAMS-1</span> strain, which does not have the saeS mutation, ClpC functioned as an activator of capsule production. Our microarray analyses of strain <span class="yellow">Newman</span> also revealed that CodY, a repressor of capsule production, was repressed by ClpC. Using genetic approaches, we showed that CodY functioned downstream of ClpC, leading to capsule activation both in <span class="yellow">Newman</span> and in <span class="yellow">UAMS-1</span>. Thus, ClpC functions in two opposite pathways in capsule regulation in strain <span class="yellow">Newman</span> but functions as a positive activator in strain <span class="yellow">UAMS-1</span>. 
<h3>21371655</h3>Clinical management of <span class="blue">Staphylococcus aureus</span> bacteraemia.<br><br><span class="blue">Staphylococcus aureus</span> bacteraemia is one of the most common serious bacterial infections worldwide. In the UK alone, around 12,500 cases each year are reported, with an associated mortality of about 30%, yet the evidence guiding optimum management is poor. To date, fewer than 1500 patients with <span class="yellow">S aureus</span> bacteraemia have been recruited to 16 controlled trials of antimicrobial therapy. Consequently, clinical practice is driven by the results of observational studies and anecdote. Here, we propose and review ten unanswered clinical questions commonly posed by those managing <span class="yellow">S aureus</span> bacteraemia. Our findings define the major areas of uncertainty in the management of <span class="yellow">S aureus</span> bacteraemia and highlight just two key principles. First, all infective foci must be identified and removed as soon as possible. Second, long-term antimicrobial therapy is required for those with persistent bacteraemia or a deep, irremovable focus. Beyond this, the best drugs, dose, mode of delivery, and duration of therapy are uncertain, a situation compounded by emerging <span class="yellow">S aureus</span> strains that are resistant to old and new antibiotics. We discuss the consequences on clinical practice, and how these findings define the agenda for future clinical research.
