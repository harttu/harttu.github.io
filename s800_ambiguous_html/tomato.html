<h2>tomato</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20173013</h3>Streptomyces lacticiproducens sp. nov., a lactic acid-producing streptomycete isolated from the rhizosphere of <span class="blue">tomato</span><span class="yellow">tomato plants</span>. <br><br>A novel actinomycete, designated strain GIMN4.001(T), was isolated from the rhizosphere of <span class="blue">tomato</span><span class="yellow">tomato plants</span> grown in Guangzhou, China. The strain produced greyish white aerial mycelia, lactic acid and a large quantity of double diamond-shaped crystals on <span class="yellow">potato</span> dextrose agar and <span class="yellow">yeast</span> extract-malt extract agar. The colour of the substrate mycelium was not sensitive to pH. Microscopic observations revealed that strain GIMN4.001(T) produced verticillate chains of cylindrical spores. Chemotaxonomic data confirmed that strain GIMN4.001(T) belonged to the genus Streptomyces. Melanin pigments were not produced. No antibacterial activity was observed against <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span>, <span class="yellow">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>, <span class="yellow">Bacillus subtilis</span> or <span class="yellow">Candida albicans</span>, but inhibitory activity was observed against <span class="yellow">Penicillium citrinum</span>. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain GIMN4.001(T) was related most closely to <span class="yellow">Streptomyces morookaense</span> <span class="yellow">ATCC 19166(T)</span> (98.9 % similarity) and <span class="yellow">Streptomyces lavenduligriseus</span> <span class="yellow">ATCC 13306(T)</span> (98.7 %). Levels of DNA-DNA relatedness between strain GIMN4.001(T) and the type strains of these species were low (14-20 %). Furthermore, strain GIMN4.001(T) could be differentiated from <span class="yellow">S. morookaense</span>, S. lavenduligriseus and other closely related species of the genus Streptomyces based on morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics. On the basis of its physiological and molecular properties, strain GIMN4.001(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces lacticiproducens sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is GIMN4.001(T) (=CCTCC M208214(T)=NRRL B-24800(T)). 
<h3>20854394</h3>SGT1 contributes to coronatine signaling and <span class="yellow">Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato</span> disease symptom development in <span class="blue">tomato</span> and <span class="yellow">Arabidopsis</span>. <br><br>* <span class="yellow">Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000</span> (<span class="yellow">Pst DC3000</span>) causes an economically important bacterial speck disease on <span class="blue">tomato</span> and produces symptoms with necrotic lesions surrounded by chlorosis. The chlorosis is mainly attributed to a jasmonic acid (JA)-isoleucine analogue, coronatine (COR), produced by <span class="yellow">Pst DC3000</span>. However, the molecular processes underlying lesion development and COR-induced chlorosis are poorly understood. * In this study, we took advantage of a chlorotic phenotype elicited by COR on <span class="yellow">Nicotiana benthamiana</span> leaves and virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) as a rapid reverse genetic screening tool and identified a role for SGT1 (suppressor of G2 allele of skp1) in COR-induced chlorosis. * Silencing of SGT1 in <span class="blue">tomato</span> resulted in reduction of disease-associated symptoms (cell death and chlorosis), suggesting a molecular connection between COR-induced chlorosis and cell death. In <span class="yellow">Arabidopsis</span>, AtSGT1b but not AtSGT1a was required for COR responses, including root growth inhibition and <span class="yellow">Pst DC3000</span> symptom (water soaked lesion) development. Notably, overexpression of AtSGT1b did not alter <span class="yellow">Pst DC3000</span> symptoms or sensitivity to COR. * Taken together, our results demonstrate that SGT1/SGT1b is required for COR-induced chlorosis and subsequent necrotic disease development in <span class="blue">tomato</span> and <span class="yellow">Arabidopsis</span>. SGT1 is therefore a component of the COR/JA-mediated signal transduction pathway. 
<h3>20955222</h3>Physiological and morphological adaptations in relation to water use efficiency in Mediterranean accessions of <span class="yellow">Solanum lycopersicum</span>. <br><br>The physiological traits underlying the apparent drought resistance of 'Tomatiga de Ramellet' (TR) cultivars, a population of Mediterranean <span class="blue">tomato</span> cultivars with delayed fruit deterioration (DFD) phenotype and typically grown under non-irrigation conditions, are evaluated. Eight different <span class="blue">tomato</span> accessions were selected and included six TR accessions, one Mediterranean non-TR accession (NTR(M)) and a processing cultivar (NTR(O)). Among the TR accessions two leaf morphology types, normal divided leaves and <span class="yellow">potato</span>-leaf, were selected. Plants were field grown under well-watered (WW) and water-stressed (WS) treatments, with 30 and 10% of soil water capacity, respectively. Accessions were clustered according to the leaf type and TR phenotype under WW and WS, respectively. Correlation among parameters under the different water treatments suggested that potential improvements in the intrinsic water-use efficiency (A(N)/g(s)) are possible without negative impacts on yield. Under WS TR accessions displayed higher A(N)/g(s), which was not due to differences in Rubisco-related parameters, but correlated with the ratio between the leaf mesophyll and stomatal conductances (g(m)/g(s)). The results confirm the existence of differential traits in the response to drought stress in Mediterranean accessions of <span class="blue">tomato</span>, and demonstrate that increases in the g(m)/g(s) ratio would allow improvements in A(N)/g(s) in horticultural crops. 
<h3>21241329</h3>The effect of competition from neighbours on stomatal conductance in <span class="yellow">lettuce</span> and <span class="blue">tomato</span><span class="yellow">tomato plants</span>. <br><br>Competition decreased transpiration from young <span class="yellow">lettuce</span> plants after 2 days, before any reductions in leaf area became apparent, and stomatal conductance (g(s) ) of <span class="yellow">lettuce</span> and <span class="blue">tomato</span><span class="yellow">tomato plants</span> was also reduced. Stomatal closure was not due to hydraulic signals or competition for nutrients, as soil water content, leaf water status and leaf nitrate concentrations were unaffected by neighbours. Competition-induced stomatal closure was absent in an abscisic acid (ABA)-deficient <span class="blue">tomato</span> mutant, flacca, indicating a fundamental involvement of ABA. Although <span class="blue">tomato</span> xylem sap ABA concentrations were unaffected by the presence of neighbours, ABA/pH-based stomatal modulation is still likely to underlie the response to competition, as soil and xylem sap alkalization was observed in competing plants. Competition also modulated leaf ethylene production, and treatment of <span class="yellow">lettuce</span> plants with an ethylene perception inhibitor (1-methylcyclopropene) diminished the difference in g(s) between single and competing plants grown in a controlled environment room, but increased it in plants grown in the greenhouse: ethylene altered the extent of the stomatal response to competition. Effects of competition on g(s) are discussed in terms of the detection of the absence of neighbours: increases in g(s) and carbon fixation may allow faster initial space occupancy within an emerging community/crop. 
<h3>21521136</h3>Host plant effects on alkaline phosphatase activity in the whiteflies, <span class="yellow">Bemisia tabaci</span> Biotype B and <span class="yellow">Trialeurodes vaporariorum</span>. <br><br><span class="yellow">Bemisia tabaci</span> (Gennadius) B-biotype and <span class="yellow">Trialeurodes vaporariorum</span> (Westwood) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) often coexist on greenhouse-grown vegetable crops in northern China. The recent spread of <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> B-biotype has largely replaced <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span>, and B-biotype now overlaps with <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span> where common hosts occur in most invaded areas. The impact of the B-biotype on the agro eco system appears to be widespread, and involves the ability to compete with and perhaps replace other phytophages like <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span>. An emerging hypothesis is that the B-biotype is physiologically superior due at least in part to an improved ability to metabolically utilize the alkaline phosphatase pathway. To test this hypothesis, alkaline phosphatase activity was studied in the B-biotype and <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span> after feeding on a number of different hosts for a range of durations, with and without host switching. Alkaline phosphatase activity in <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span> was 1.45 to 2.53-fold higher than that of the B-biotype when fed on <span class="blue">tomato</span> for 4 and 24 h, or switched from <span class="blue">tomato</span> to <span class="yellow">cotton</span> and <span class="yellow">cabbage</span> for the same durations. However, alkaline phosphatase activity in the B-biotype was 1.40 to 3.35-fold higher than that of <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span> when the host switching time was -72 and -120 h on the same plant. Both short-term (4 h) and long-term (72 h) switching of plant hosts can significantly affect the alkaline phosphatase activity in the two species. After -120 h, feeding on <span class="blue">tomato</span> and <span class="yellow">cotton</span> alkaline phosphatase activity in the B-biotype was significantly higher than that of <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span>. It was shown that alkaline phosphatase aids the species feeding on different plant species, and that the B-biotype is physiologically superior to <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span> in utilizing the enzyme compared to <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span> over longer periods of feeding. 
<h3>21907298</h3><span class="yellow">Galleria mellonella</span> as model host for the trans-kingdom pathogen <span class="yellow">Fusarium oxysporum</span>. <br><br><span class="yellow">Fusarium oxysporum</span>, the causal agent of vascular wilt disease, affects a wide range of plant species and can produce disseminated infections in <span class="yellow">humans</span>. <span class="yellow">F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici isolate FGSC 9935</span> causes disease both on <span class="yellow">tomato plants</span> and immunodepressed <span class="yellow">mice</span>, making it an ideal model for the comparative analysis of <span class="yellow">fungal</span> virulence on plant and animal hosts. Here we tested the ability of <span class="yellow">FGSC 9935</span> to cause disease in the <span class="yellow">greater wax moth</span> <span class="yellow">Galleria mellonella</span>, an invertebrate model host that is widely used for the study of microbial <span class="yellow">human</span> pathogens. Injection of living but not of heat-killed microconidia into the hemocoel of <span class="yellow">G. mellonella</span> larvae resulted in dose-dependent killing both at 30^0C and at 37^0C. Fluorescence microscopy of larvae inoculated with a <span class="yellow">F. oxysporum transformant</span> expressing GFP revealed hyphal proliferation within the hemocoel, interaction with <span class="yellow">G. mellonella</span> hemocytes, and colonization of the killed insects by the fungus. Fungal gene knockout mutants previously tested in the <span class="blue">tomato</span> and immunodepressed <span class="yellow">mouse</span> systems displayed a good correlation in virulence between the Galleria and the <span class="yellow">mouse</span> model. Thus, Galleria represents a useful non-vertebrate infection model for studying virulence mechanisms of <span class="yellow">F. oxysporum</span> on animal hosts. 
<h3>22182623</h3>Interspecific Interactions Between <span class="yellow">Bemisia tabaci</span> Biotype B and <span class="yellow">Trialeurodes vaporariorum</span> (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae). <br><br><span class="yellow">Bemisia tabaci</span> (Gennadius) biotype B and <span class="yellow">Trialeurodes vaporariorum</span> (Westwood) are invasive whitefly species that often co-occur on greenhouse-grown vegetables in northern China. Although <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> biotype B has been present in China for a relatively short period of time, it has become dominant over <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span>. We studied the interspecific competitive interactions between the two species in single or mixed cultures at 24 +/- 1^0C, 40 +/- 5% RH, and L14:D10 h photoperiod. Female longevity on <span class="blue">tomato</span> was not significantly different between species, but <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> reproduced 4.3 to 4.9 fold more progeny. The ratio of female to male progeny in both instances was greater for <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span>. When cultured on <span class="blue">tomato</span>, <span class="yellow">cotton</span>, and <span class="yellow">tobacco</span>, <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> developed 0.8, 3.3, and 4.7 d earlier in single culture, and 1.8, 3.9, and 4.3 d earlier in mixed culture. <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> displaced <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span> in four, five and six generations when the initial ratios of <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> to <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span> were 15:15, 20:10, or 10:20 on <span class="red">tomato</span>. Populations of <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> were 2.3 fold higher than that of <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span> on <span class="blue">tomato</span><span class="yellow">tomato plants</span> for seven consecutive generations in single culture. <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> performed better in development, survival, fecundity, and female ratio. We conclude that <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span> could displace <span class="yellow">T. vaporariorum</span> in as short as four generations in a controlled greenhouse environment when they start at equal proportions. Warmer greenhouse conditions and an increase in total greenhouse area could be contributing factors in the recent dominance of <span class="yellow">B. tabaci</span>. 
<h3>21039561</h3>Ecological trade-offs between jasmonic acid-dependent direct and indirect plant defences in tritrophic interactions. <br><br>Recent studies on plants genetically modified in jasmonic acid (JA) signalling support the hypothesis that the jasmonate family of oxylipins plays an important role in mediating direct and indirect plant defences. However, the interaction of two modes of defence in tritrophic systems is largely unknown. In this study, we examined the preference and performance of a herbivorous <span class="yellow">leafminer</span> (<span class="yellow">Liriomyza huidobrensis</span>) and its parasitic <span class="yellow">wasp</span> (<span class="yellow">Opius dissitus</span>) on three <span class="blue">tomato</span> genotypes: a <span class="yellow">wild-type (WT) plant</span>, a <span class="yellow">JA biosynthesis (spr2) mutant</span>, and a <span class="yellow">JA-overexpression 35S::prosys plant</span>. Their proteinase inhibitor production and volatile emission were used as direct and indirect defence factors to evaluate the responses of <span class="yellow">leafminers</span> and parasitoids. Here, we show that although <span class="yellow">spr2 mutant plants</span> are compromised in direct defence against the larval <span class="yellow">leafminers</span> and in attracting parasitoids, they are less attractive to adult flies compared with <span class="yellow">WT plants</span>. Moreover, in comparison to other genotypes, the <span class="yellow">35S::prosys plant</span> displays greater direct and constitutive indirect defences, but reduced success of parasitism by parasitoids. Taken together, these results suggest that there are distinguished ecological trade-offs between JA-dependent direct and indirect defences in genetically modified plants whose fitness should be assessed in tritrophic systems and under natural conditions.
