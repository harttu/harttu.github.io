<h2>Theiler's murine encephalitis virus</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20962089</h3>Antiviral effects of a transgenic RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.<br><br>Transgenic expression of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3D(pol) inhibited infection of <span class="match annotated ">Theiler's murine encephalitis virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">TMEV</span>), a picornavirus from which it was derived. Here, we infected 3D(pol) transgenic <span class="annotated ">mice</span> with another picornavirus, as well as an alphaherpesvirus and a rhabdovirus. 3D(pol) transgenic FVB <span class="annotated ">mice</span> had significantly lower <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> loads and survived longer after infection with all three types of viruses than nontransgenic FVB <span class="annotated ">mice</span>. Viral inhibition among three different types of <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> by transgenic 3D(pol) suggests that the mechanism of action is not the direct interference with picornaviral 3D(pol) but instead may be the changing of host cells to an antiviral state before or after <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> infection occurs, as basal interferon levels were higher in 3D(pol) transgenic <span class="annotated ">mice</span> before infection. Further study of this mechanism may open new possibilities for future antiviral therapy.
