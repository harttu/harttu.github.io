<h2>lsaria (=Paecilomyces) sp.</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21521145</h3>Occurrence of entomopathogenic fungi from agricultural and natural ecosystems in Saltillo, Mexico, and their virulence towards thrips and whiteflies. <br><br>Entomopathogenic fungi were collected from soil in four adjacent habitats (oak forest, agricultural soil, pine reforestation and chaparral habitat) in Saltillo, Mexico using the insect bait method with <span class="yellow">Tenebrio molitor</span> (L.) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) larvae as bait. Overall, of the larvae exposed to soil, 171 (20%) hosted <span class="yellow">Beauveria bassiana</span> (Balsamo) Vuillemin (Hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae), 25 (3%) hosted <span class="yellow">Metarhizium anisopliae</span> (Metschnikoff) Sorokin (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae) and 1 (0.1%) hosted <span class="blue">lsaria (=Paecilomyces) sp.</span> (Hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae). <span class="yellow">B. bassiana</span> was significantly more frequent on larvae exposed to oak forest soil. <span class="yellow">M. anisopliae</span> was significantly more frequent on larvae exposed to agricultural soil. From the infected bait insects, 93 isolates of <span class="yellow">B. bassiana</span> and 24 isolates of <span class="yellow">M. anisopliae</span> were obtained. Strains were tested for their infectivity against <span class="yellow">Cuban laurel thrips</span>, Gynaikothrips uzeli Zimmerman (Thysanoptera: Phlaeothripidae) and the <span class="yellow">greenhouse whitefly</span>, <span class="yellow">Trialeurodes vaporariorum</span> (Westwood) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae). <span class="yellow">B. bassiana</span> isolates caused the highest mortality on thrips (some causing 88% mortality after 6 days); both <span class="yellow">fungal</span> species caused similarly high mortality levels against whiteflies (75%) after 6 days. Large amounts of germplasm of entomopathogenic fungi, fundamentally <span class="yellow">B. bassiana</span> and <span class="yellow">M. anisopliae</span>, exist in the habitats sampled; pathogenicity varied among strains, and some strains possessed significant virulence. Soils in these habitats are reservoirs of diverse strains with potential for use in biocontrol.
