<h2>Scardovia inopinata</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20139283</h3><span class="annotated ">Scardovia wiggsiae</span> sp. nov., isolated from the <span class="annotated ">human</span> oral cavity and clinical material, and emended descriptions of the genus Scardovia and <span class="match annotated ">Scardovia inopinata</span>. <br><br>Six strains of anaerobic, pleomorphic Gram-positive bacilli, isolated from the <span class="annotated ">human</span> oral cavity and an infected arm wound, were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests and were found to comprise a homogeneous group. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the isolates were most closely related to <span class="match annotated ">Scardovia inopinata</span> CCUG 35729(T) (94.8-94.9 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). The isolates were saccharolytic and produced acetic and lactic acids as end products of fermentation. The major fatty acids were C(16 : 0) (49.8 %) and C(18 : 1)omega9c (35.8 %). Polar lipid analysis revealed a variety of glycolipids, diphosphatidylglycerol, an unidentified phospholipid and an unidentified phosphoglycolipid. No respiratory quinones were detected. The peptidoglycan was of the type A4alpha L-Lys-Thr-Glu, with L-lysine partially replaced by L-ornithine. The DNA G+C content of one of the strains, C1A_55(T)(,) was 55 mol%. <span class="unannotated ">A</span> novel species, <span class="annotated ">Scardovia wiggsiae</span> sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate the six isolates, with the type strain C1A_55(T) (=DSM 22547(T)=CCUG 58090(T)).
