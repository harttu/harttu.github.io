<h2>ORSV</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>20933014</h3>Monoclonal antibody-based triple antibody sandwich-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunocapture reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for <span class="yellow">Odontoglossum ringspot virus</span> detection. <br><br><span class="yellow">Odontoglossum ringspot virus</span> (<span class="blue">ORSV</span>) infects numerous commercially important orchids and causes significant losses worldwide. The coat protein (CP) gene of <span class="blue">ORSV</span> was cloned and expressed in <span class="yellow">Escherichia coli</span> by using the pET-32a expression vector, and the expression of recombinant protein was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-<span class="blue">ORSV</span> antibodies. The recombinant protein was purified using Ni-NTA agarose, and the purified protein was used as an immunogen to produce monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and polyclonal antibodies (PAbs). Five murine MAbs against <span class="blue">ORSV</span> CP were obtained. Among them, two MAbs (6B4 and 1D1) also reacted with TMV CP. The triple antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (TAS-ELISA) and immunocapture reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (IC-RT-PCR) methods using the MAb (8A5) were then developed for sensitive, specific, and rapid detection of <span class="blue">ORSV</span>. TAS-ELISA and IC-RT-PCR could detect <span class="blue">ORSV</span> in the infected leaf saps with dilutions of 1:10,240 and 1:81,920 (w/v, g mL(-1)), respectively. TAS-ELISA and IC-RT-PCR detections indicated that <span class="blue">ORSV</span> was prevalent in orchids in the Zhejiang Province of China.
