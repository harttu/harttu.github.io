<h2>simian immunodeficiency virus</h2><span class="unannotated">not annotated</span> - <span class="annotated">annotated</span> - <span class="linneaus_only">LINNEUS only</span><br><hr><h3>20962091</h3>Macaque long-term nonprogressors resist superinfection with multiple CD8+ T cell escape variants of <span class="match annotated ">simian immunodeficiency virus</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Human immunodeficiency virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">HIV</span>)-positive individuals can be superinfected with different <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> strains. Individuals who control an initial <span class="annotated ">HIV</span> infection are therefore still at risk for subsequent infection with divergent viruses, but the barriers to such superinfection remain unclear. Here we tested long-term nonprogressors' (LTNPs') susceptibility to superinfection using <span class="annotated ">Indian rhesus macaques</span> that express the major histocompatibility complex <span class="unannotated ">class I</span> (MHC-I) allele Mamu-B 17, which is associated with control of the pathogenic AIDS <span class="annotated ">virus SIVmac239</span>. The Mamu-B 17-restricted CD8(+) T cell repertoire is focused almost entirely on 5 epitopes. We engineered a series of <span class="unannotated ">SIVmac239</span> variants bearing mutations in 3, 4, or all 5 of these epitopes and used them to serially challenge 2 Mamu-B 17-positive LTNPs. None of the escape variants caused breakthrough replication in LTNPs, although they readily infected Mamu-B 17-negative naive macaques. In vitro competing coculture assays and examination of <span class="unannotated ">viral</span> evolution in hosts lacking Mamu-B 17 suggested that the mutant viruses had negligible defects in replicative fitness. Both LTNPs maintained robust immune responses, including <span class="match annotated ">simian immunodeficiency virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">SIV</span>)-specific CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells and neutralizing antibodies. Our results suggest that escape mutations in epitopes bound by &quot;protective&quot; MHC-I molecules may not be sufficient to establish superinfection in LTNPs. 
<h3>20962096</h3>Identification and structural characterization of the ALIX-binding late domains of <span class="match annotated ">simian immunodeficiency virus</span> <span class="unannotated ">SIVmac239</span> and <span class="annotated ">SIVagmTan-1</span>. <br><br><span class="annotated ">Retroviral</span> Gag proteins contain short late-domain motifs that recruit cellular ESCRT pathway proteins to facilitate <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> budding. ALIX-binding late domains often contain the core consensus sequence YPX(n)L (where X(n) can vary in sequence and length). However, some <span class="match annotated ">simian immunodeficiency virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">SIV</span>) Gag proteins lack this consensus sequence, yet still bind ALIX. We mapped divergent, ALIX-binding late domains within the p6(Gag) proteins of SIV(mac239) ((40)SREKPYKEVTEDLLHLNSLF(59)) and <span class="annotated ">SIV(agmTan-1)</span> ((24)AAGAYDPARKLLEQYAKK(41)). Crystal structures revealed that anchoring tyrosines (in lightface) and nearby hydrophobic residues (underlined) contact the ALIX V domain, revealing how lentiviruses employ a diverse family of late-domain sequences to bind ALIX and promote <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> budding. 
<h3>20962077</h3><span class="annotated ">Simian immunodeficiency virus</span> from the <span class="annotated ">sooty mangabey</span> and <span class="annotated ">rhesus macaque</span> is modified with O-linked carbohydrate. <br><br>Although stretches of serine and threonine are sometimes sites for O-linked carbohydrate attachment, specific sequence and structural determinants for O-linked attachment remain ill defined. The gp120 envelope protein of <span class="annotated ">SIVmac239</span> contains a serine-threonine-rich stretch of amino acids at positions 128 to 139. Here we show that lectin protein from <span class="annotated ">jackfruit</span> seed (jacalin), which binds to non- and monosialylated core 1 O-linked carbohydrate, potently inhibited the replication of <span class="annotated ">SIVmac239</span>. Selection of a jacalin-resistant <span class="annotated ">SIVmac239</span> variant population resulted in <span class="unannotated ">virus</span> with specific substitutions within amino acids 128 to 139. Cloned <span class="match annotated ">simian immunodeficiency virus</span> (<span class="annotated ">SIV</span>) variants with substitutions in the 128-to-139 region had infectivities equivalent to, or within 1 log unit of, that of <span class="annotated ">SIVmac239</span> and were resistant to the inhibitory effects of jacalin. Characterization of the <span class="annotated ">SIVmac239</span> gp120 O-linked glycome showed the presence of core 1 and core 2 O-linked carbohydrate; a 128-to-139-substituted variant gp120 from jacalin-resistant <span class="annotated ">SIV</span> lacked O-linked carbohydrate. Unlike that of <span class="annotated ">SIVmac239</span>, the replication of <span class="annotated ">HIV-1 strain NL4-3</span> was resistant to inhibition by jacalin. Purified gp120s from four <span class="annotated ">SIVmac</span> and <span class="annotated ">SIVsm</span> strains bound jacalin strongly in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while nine different <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> gp120s, two <span class="annotated ">SIVcpz</span> gp120s, and 128-to-139-substituted <span class="annotated ">SIVmac239</span> gp120 did not bind jacalin. The ability or inability to bind jacalin thus correlated with the presence of the serine-threonine-rich stretch in the <span class="annotated ">SIVmac</span> and <span class="annotated ">SIVsm</span> gp120s and the absence of such stretches in the <span class="annotated ">SIVcpz</span> and <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> gp120s. Consistent with sequence predictions, two <span class="annotated ">HIV-2</span> gp120s bound jacalin, while one did not. These data demonstrate the presence of non- and monosialylated core 1 O-linked carbohydrate on the gp120s of <span class="annotated ">SIVmac</span> and <span class="annotated ">SIVsm</span> and the lack of these modifications on <span class="annotated ">HIV-1</span> and <span class="annotated ">SIVcpz</span> gp120s.
