<h2>murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV)</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21047954</h3>Complement opsonization enhances friend <span class="yellow">virus</span> infection of B cells and thereby amplifies the virus-specific CD8+ T cell response. 

B cells are one of the targets of <span class="yellow">Friend virus</span> (FV) infection, a well-established <span class="yellow">mouse</span> model often used to study <span class="yellow">retroviral</span> infections in vivo. Although B cells may be effective in stimulating cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, studies involving their role in <span class="yellow">FV</span> infection have mainly focused on neutralizing antibody production. Here we show that polyclonal activation of B cells promotes their infection with <span class="yellow">FV</span> both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that complement opsonization of Friend <span class="blue">murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV)</span> enhances infection of B cells, which correlates with increased potency of B cells to activate FV-specific CD8(+) T cells.
