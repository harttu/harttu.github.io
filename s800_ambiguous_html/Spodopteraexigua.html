<h2>Spodoptera exigua</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21477200</h3><span class="yellow">Baculovirus</span> cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyases show a close relationship with lepidopteran host homologues. <br><br>Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) photolyases repair ultraviolet (UV)-induced DNA damage using blue light. To get insight in the origin of <span class="yellow">baculovirus</span> CPD photolyase (phr) genes, homologues in the lepidopteran insects <span class="yellow">Chrysodeixis chalcites</span>, <span class="blue">Spodoptera exigua</span> and <span class="yellow">Trichoplusia ni</span> were identified and characterized. Lepidopteran and <span class="yellow">baculovirus</span> phr genes each form a monophyletic group, and together form a well-supported clade within the insect photolyases. This suggests that <span class="yellow">baculoviruses</span> obtained their phr genes from an ancestral lepidopteran insect host. <span class="yellow">A</span> likely evolutionary scenario is that a granulovirus, <span class="yellow">Spodoptera litura GV</span> or a direct ancestor, obtained a phr gene. Subsequently, it was horizontally transferred from this granulovirus to several group II nucleopolyhedroviruses (NPVs), including those that infect noctuids of the Plusiinae subfamily.
