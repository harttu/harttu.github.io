<h2>Potato leaf roll virus</h2><span class="red">Not tagged name</span> - <span class="blue">Tagged name</span> - <span class="yellow">Other name</span><br><hr><h3>21039560</h3>The second face of a known player: <span class="yellow">Arabidopsis</span> silencing suppressor AtXRN4 acts organ-specifically. 

Plant viruses exploit the symplastic transport pathway provided by plasmodesmata by encoding for specialized movement proteins, which interact with host factors to enable <span class="yellow">viral</span> intracellular and intercellular spread. Stable expression of the <span class="blue">Potato leaf roll virus</span> movement protein MP17 in <span class="yellow">Arabidopsis</span> results in a carbohydrate export block and stunted growth. To identify host factors essential for <span class="yellow">viral</span> infection, we screened a progeny population of EMS (ethyl methanesulfonate)-mutagenized <span class="yellow">Arabidopsis</span> expressing a MP17:GFP fusion for suppressor mutants with restored wild type-like phenotype. Two suppressor mutants showed decreased susceptibility against <span class="yellow">Turnip mosaic virus</span> and post-transcriptional silencing of MP17:GFP RNA in source leaves. Map based cloning identified in both lines mutations in XRN4 (Exoribonuclease 4), which was previously described as a suppressor of transgene silencing in source leaves. Importantly, silencing of MP17:GFP was not present in cotyledons and roots of the two suppressor mutants, which was confirmed in a third xrn4 T-DNA knock out line. Subsequent analysis of MP17:GFP transcript stability in xrn2 and xrn3 mutants indicated an essential role of AtXRN2 for silencing suppression in roots/cotyledons while AtXRN3 appears to act similar to AtXRN4 in source leaves, only. Overall, these findings point towards an organ-specific regulation of gene silencing in <span class="yellow">Arabidopsis</span>.
